A very, very good game -- not only as its own thing, but as a model of easy hackability. However, I've played a lot of it now, amongst two groups and two different sets of players, and several items are jumping out at me as bothersome. I thought I'd share those here, in (hopefully) the same spirit as some other deep-read/deep-play analyses I've posted in the past. Please fight the urge to circle the wagons.<br/><br/>1) "Take a move from any playbook" is a dicey proposition. Take the Skinner, specifically "An Arresting Skinner." Personally I think the move is busted, because there's no roll involved (therefore it is a conflict-ender, not a potential conflict-extender) <i>and</i> is fine-tuneable by the player to hit only specific characters in a scene. If it were just the Skinner's move I wouldn't mind so much, because playing a Skinner comes with its own challenges. However, anyone can take that move. Our most recent exploit of this has been the Battlebabe, who is pure +cool -- a problem when the only counterbalance I can think of is Act Under Fire, and that girl is built to act under fire almost exclusively. So anyway, I'm not sure if this is just a problem with "An Arresting Skinner" or more broadly with the "take a move from any playbook" advance. If it were up to me, I'd *at the very least* require an Act Under Fire of the move itself, so at least when it's used by the Skinner herself there's a chance the move will result in further conflict.<br/><br/>2) Optional battle moves don't work as advertised. I get why they exist -- they give the players a chance to set up the fight a little bit before the GM starts hitting them with harm -- but like "lay down cover fire" doesn't really do anything but potentially hurt the players. <br/><br/>3) Speaking of hurting more than helping, the help/interfere rules also do more harm than good for the most part, at least 'til you're talking Hx+2 or so. Anything less than that and all you're doing is giving the MC more hard moves. It's becoming work to not just escalate a conflict to hard moves, but goddamn! It's fairly easy/common for the players to hand me 3 moves before a conflict even begins in earnest. That can't be the intent of the rule. Right now, failing at help/interfere feels like a conflict of interest.<br/><br/>4) Seize By Force is problematic for reasons already discussed elsewhere in this forum. It might be as simple as clarifying "take definite hold" in context with combat: If I've taken definite hold of "your life", then why is "do more harm" (or whatever the wording is) even an option? Is it just to create a "do you kill him or fuck him up really bad" choice? This again seems like a conflict of interest with the "view NPCs through crosshairs" aesthetic of the game.<br/><br/>5) After maybe ... 15ish sessions total now, I'm feeling kind of a grinding creative exhaustion from running AW. The Fronts were fun to put together, albeit quite a bit of homework for a nu-skool game, but even they don't really provide that much in-play guidance to me any more. I've been thinking about this phenomenon quite a lot. It might be the constrained list of MC moves. Initially it was a fun creative challenge, but now I know the moves and the challenge isn't that much fun any more. I have no idea if anyone else has experienced this, and if so what your theories on this might be. My other theory is that it feels like ... despite the Fronts and despite the pc-npc-pc triangles, the vast majority of adversity is presented by the MC. That's a lot of work. Mouse Guard, IMO an extremely similar game to GM, has a similar issue but at least there's an explicit teamwork structure to the setup, and the characters' Beliefs stand out as super-useful flags.<br/><br/>Well, there's my list of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">grievances</span> issues. So far my recipe of updates/changes/recommendations is:<br/><br/>* Consider marking some moves as hardcoded to a playbook, and not take-able by other books.<br/><br/>* Build an Act Under Fire roll into An Arresting Skinner move, and/or otherwise introduce some element of uncertainty to the move.<br/><br/>* Ditch or radically rethink the optional battle moves. I'd start by thinking through how you'd want to zoom in on battle: is the point to give the players more tactical options? To give the MC more opportunities to make hard moves? <br/><br/>* Perhaps formally eliminate the normal consequence of failure (GM makes a move) from the help/interfere rules, and keep it intact otherwise (I do really like the 7-9 result)<br/><br/>* Restrict Seize by Force to literal seizings of literal, actual things. And/or clarify what "take definite hold" means in a fight. And/or rethink the "take 1/take 3" list.<br/><br/>* Maybe add some sort of "what do you want?" type flagging element to characters. Dunno what that'd be. Mmmaybe add a couple questions to the character creation bit, stuff other than how the character looks. I'm not at all persuaded that the moves are flags at all.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304186/#Comment_304186" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-13T10:30:19+00:00" title="December 13, 2010 10:30AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I'm not sure what to do I ask my players questions about their characters; Sometimes I do think of this as flag-hunting.<br/><br/>Each different kind of front comes with its own list of moves for the MC to utilize.

I'm going to reply about those things with which I have some personal play experience, which isn't everything on your list. <br/><br/>(1) Take any move from another playbook, I've found, to primarily cause blending of the playbooks, which may or may not be intentional. But other than that, I don't think I've noticed anything outright wrong with the advancement. I think perhaps this is down to Arresting Skinner, as opposed to the ability to yank moves from other playbooks, exactly. Although, I will say that maybe with the improvement issue itself, the answer is to make it make sense a bit? For a Battlebabe, it may make sense in fiction for the 'babe to become "an arresting skinner," but for a hardholder? That sense may be absent. In which case the best policy may be just to talk to the player and say, "So what's your thought process here? Why do you think you want this move?" But ultimately, I haven't seen it as that much of an issue in my own experiences.<br/><br/>As for Arresting Skinner...this is a tough one. I've only been on the using end of the move, and not on the receiving end, so of course I think it's amazingly awesome. What I would say in defense of the move: <br/>- It's temporary; unless you've got help from others, your enemies are only frozen for as long as you're stripping. If you're trying to do something like escape or pull a weapon while stripping, that could certainly be an Act Under Fire roll. Otherwise, the Skinner is seemingly as incapacitated as the people watching. <br/>- It's even more temporary because you need to be taking off clothing. There will come a point at which you do not have clothing, and will need to start taking it off others, or stop. You could feasibly say that at that point, it's Acting Under Fire to get over to someone else and start taking off their clothing before the angry gang members with big guns wake up.<br/>- You can get around it by either getting the Skinner in a place where he/she doesn't have any clothes, or in a place where he/she doesn't have any help. So, the move breeds some conflict because the Skinner needs friends to use it effectively, and in AW, in my experience, the mere act of having a friend is highly problematic.<br/><br/>(2) Haven't seen these in play, can't comment.<br/><br/>(3) The games I play, we haven't used Hx that much, so I can't really comment here, either. Maybe your group just has particularly low Hx? It would seem that after a bit, because people are giving each other +1 Hx at the end of every session, Hx between at least some players would get to the point of consistent efficacy. Especially if they're shooting each other. <br/><br/>(4) Yeah, don't want to get much into this debate either, but I see the "take definite hold of your life" option as being similar to the Go Aggro thing of, "I want you to die, or you can suck up the hit from my gun." So, you die, or you die. Taking definite hold of someone's life, then, is letting you kill them, but it is by no means the only use of that term, the same way that Go Aggro has lots of other uses besides "I want you to die." <br/><br/>(5) Haven't really been an MC, so I don't have much to say here, either, except that as a player, I can tell you that inter-character conflict can certainly erupt. In one game, we're pretty much a unified front against the evil NPC hardholder, but in another game, I've got one character on the run because some schmuck possessed him and made him commit a bunch of murders, and the hardholder (PC) believes that my guy did it. So, that PC-PC conflict is definitely in there, nicely. But then, maybe that still doesn't relieve the burden from the MC significantly.<br/><br/>Maybe you can just ask the players what they want? Just, outright?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304189/#Comment_304189" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-13T10:41:14+00:00" title="December 13, 2010 10:41AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Judd: <br/><br/>Yeah, I'm asking tons of questions -- also using the Pychic Maelstrom "ask a question" effect for this purpose in large part. It helps, and reincorporating Maelstrom answers really is a pretty great trick. But maybe I'm ... it might just be that BW has utterly ruined me for GM-heavy adversity. :-D<br/><br/>Playbooks with "at the start of the session" rolls are terrific, I've found, as are the ones that give you gangs or gigs or whatever. The ones missing that, and Skinner in particular, are more trouble.<br/><br/>Definitely also using the threat-specific moves, but I've got those well internalized as well. Very occasionally the threat moves will prompt me in a direction I hadn't considered before. I think most recently it was having Brutes go and do something nice for the hardholder, like ally with him or something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304197/#Comment_304197" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-13T11:27:34+00:00" title="December 13, 2010 11:27AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, this is a really interesting post. Thanks for starting this conversation.<br/><br/>1) In my experience, playbook moves aren't balanced against each other and are not supposed to be.  Moves like "An Arresting Skinner" are intentionally exceptions to how players normally do things; that's part of what Vincent was intending, I think, with his "exception-based design" approach.  Honestly, if players are looking for ways to chain moves together to get lethal combos, there are much better ways to do it.  Brandon, I think, had a character who could instantly deal 6+ harm AP by the end of the first campaign I played in. Worrying about that, in my mind, is kinda missing the point.  The rules empower the players to be (in the normal sense of the words) hard, hot, sharp, cool, and weird badasses and there's not a GM principle that says "make sure the characters face challenges" or anything like that.  If you feel like the players being too badass is breaking your game, I'm not sure what to tell you, since that's partially what the game is about, yeah?  When I have had trouble as a GM -- or have watched others have trouble -- it's often because we're trying to challenge the characters (we have a fictional agenda of some type) rather than "playing to find out what happens."<br/><br/>2-3) In games I've been a part of, the battles moves are only triggered when you're in a battle, which means things have already gone to hell.  Players never (or rarely) intentionally choose to use supplemental moves unless they've stumbled into the very specific situation when they apply, which means they hardly ever get used.  Plus, typically being proactive is way better for you than Stay The Fuck Down or whatever.  On the other hand, we've had great experiences with helping and interfering in our games.  Frequently, we allow people to roll to help (though usually not to interfere) after the initial roll has been made, when we know that a +1 or +2 will enable it to move up to the next level of success.  It's possible that this cuts down on the instances where people help "unnecessarily," but it also sometimes pulls everybody together in failure if a roll fails and then rolls to assist also fail or expose people.  That works nicely, I think, so if you're having trouble with helping, maybe you should consider rolling after the initial roll instead of before.<br/><br/>4) John has recently decided to treat Seize By Force as a peripheral move, because people tend to overuse it for things it's not intended for.  I haven't yet played in a game that treated it this way, but I may lean towards light use of it when I run it in the future, based on other people's experiences.<br/><br/>5) Our campaign exhaustion has varied a bit.  Generally speaking, though, players seem to switch to new characters soon after they've opened up the advanced versions all their moves and made a couple of 12+ rolls.  At that point, they've found some scrap of beauty or truth in the world, generally (often through use of the advanced moves), and it seems a good place to move on and go back to the muck.  Often, AW characters seem to not really know what to do with themselves once they have found some escape from the muck of the world, so it's a good time to retire them or end the campaign.  That said, it seems really up to the GM to be able to maintain interest in developing the threats that are still in play.  If the players have taken down or exhausted a couple of threats and you're not really interested in the other ones anymore, maybe it's time to quit or take a break for a while, yeah?  Burnout happens to everybody eventually and especially in AW, where so much is based on interesting things happening in the fiction, if you're not interested in the fiction right now, you probably should step away from the game, at least for a while.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304203/#Comment_304203" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-13T11:43:21+00:00" title="December 13, 2010 11:43AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

Frequently, "I do this", "I'm making this move", and "here was my roll" were all presented in a single post.  This lead to helping/interfering moves being added in a subsequent response post.  I don't think it hurt the gameplay at all.  Having the help/interfere be a reaction to a move can also be worked into the drama pretty well because its another way of chaining moves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304226/#Comment_304226" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-13T12:56:03+00:00" title="December 13, 2010 12:56PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, so.<br/><br/>Trading moves between books results in blending -- yes, agreed. I'm not persuaded that that's a "good" thing. It's like anti-niche-protection, which is sort of funny in a really meta "D&amp;D sucks!" way. I'm not sure what the actual inplay upside is, especially since shopping the playbooks easily exposes some moves as simply better than others by any metric. The fact the playbooks are not balanced isn't A Good Thing in this case. It just means that each playbook's distinctiveness can/will get juked by every player.<br/><br/>Arresting Skinner: "Does taking the move make sense in the fiction?" is weak sauce, sorry. Everything about AW can simultaneously be treated proscriptively and descriptively. If my character takes An Arresting Skinner, that means s/he is now a supernatural stripper. The fiction may have led us to that point, or the player is leading the fiction to that point by taking the move, but in any case it's there and in play. I cannot think of any circumstance in actual play or even in hypothetical play in which the conflict-ending quality of that move is good for play. But you do make a good point, Brendan, that the stripper needs a pal to make use of the effect. Again, not persuaded that isolating a character just so s/he can't use her killer move is good play. Executive summary: Still think A.S. is a badly designed move.<br/><br/>Helping/interfering: Jamey, in a whisper/chat made a pretty good case for the move really only happening between high-Hx characters. So I'm moving off my "help/interfere is busted" position.<br/><br/>Seize by Force: Yeah, I saw John's thing about treating it like a supplemental move. However, it's still a move. I'm not sure that recategorizing SBF fixes the move. By "fix" I mean both "clarify the intent of" and "make an interesting choice to use". In my latest AW campaign, I've been pushing for the players to just Go Aggro in most cases, since in most cases what they're really trying to do is modify behavior, not just murder. That ... helps. It's also highlighted the difference between the moves, that the threshold for doing damage via SBF is lower but you face taking some harm along the way. Which really just leaves me asking, again, what the heck "take definite hold" actually means, and what the move looks like if your "take 3" doesn't include that choice.<br/><br/>Jonathan, I'm having trouble reading your first and last points and not hearing a condescending tone in them. Just putting that out there, and I'm totally willing to accept that that wasn't the tone you were going for. I'd like to stay focused on the structural issues that may be causing my creative fatigue. As far as "playing to find out what happens" versus challenging the player: really that's not true as far as I can tell. We don't actually have to play to find out what happens any more, because what's going to happen is the Battlebabe who took An Arresting Skinner will, every single time, take her shirt off, the mooks are going to stop marauding, and the other characters are going to systematically beat the mooks' brains in with bats. Every time. There's no reason, either in the fiction or in the mechanics, for that sequence not to happen. It is an uninteresting choice, facilitated by the mechanics. The mechanics are interfering with the MC's principle to make their lives not boring.<br/><br/>That said, that's a really interesting observation you made about people dropping their characters after they've opened their advanced moves and made a couple 12+ rolls. We just had a player Open His Brain at 12+, and it was super-cool to be able to give him the straight answer about the setting...but he's still awfully keen on carrying on.

I was just trying to come up with some reasoning. Didn't really work.<br/><br/>As far as blending of playbooks goes...honestly, I'm very much on the fence about this one. There's a thread from BFA which addresses the x, y, and z-axes which exist within this game in terms of character efficacy. I don't remember the exact terms, but it was something like, one axis is mechanical efficacy, and one is fictional efficacy. I just went a-hunting for it, but I didn't find it, sadly. If I find it later, I'll put it up later, or someone else can totally show me up. <br/><br/>Regardless, the point I got from that thread was that different playbooks have different kinds of efficacy. A Skinner has mechanical efficacy in the form of Arresting Skinner, but has nowhere near as much control over the immediate fiction as does the Hardholder, who inherently controls the description and information about the hardhold. I think. I may have been getting it wrong. But the point, assuming my interpretation was correct, was that one playbook may seem "better" than another mechanically, but that's because that's a false comparison. There are other things going on than pure mechanics. So I'm not sure it's fair to say one is better than another.<br/><br/>But with the blending...I always was a fan of the "You are X, and the only X" in AW, which is why the blending kind of bothers me. So I'm with you there. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>We don't actually have to play to find out what happens any more, because what's going to happen is the Battlebabe who took An Arresting Skinner will, every single time, take her shirt off, the mooks are going to stop marauding, and the other characters are going to systematically beat the mooks' brains in with bats. Every time. There's no reason, either in the fiction or in the mechanics, for that sequence not to happen.</blockquote>\nThis seems to be a pretty significant thing. What I immediately want to do is echo John's point, and say, "What? Mooks? There are mooks? Shouldn't everyone have a name, be a person?" Not to mention, what I also say is "What happens when there's a plague? What happens when there's a drought? A famine? A giant alligator? Pretty sure you can't arresting skinner an alligator." <br/><br/>Not least of which, I will echo Jonathan Walton's point, too. It seems to me that the characters in AW are supposed to be terribly powerful. They can stomp on anyone. The thing is, from what I've gathered, to actually build anything, to improve the world, to make it better...that's hard. That means you can't just stomp on anyone. You've got to actually try to work with people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304253/#Comment_304253" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-13T14:36:25+00:00" title="December 13, 2010  2:36PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris:<br/><br/>I'm not sure I really have a goal, insofar as I haven't posted this to the "play advice" category. I'm sharing my observations about the game after fewer than 86 sessions. I've only got 30ish sessions in me so far. I'm not at all surprised that one reaction -- perhaps the <i>standard</i> S-G reaction -- to this is either "you're playing it wrong" and/or "this isn't the game for you." I'm really not sure how that came to be such a common mantra. It strikes me as an easy way out of a conversation, especially when it happens so quickly. "Ur doin it rong" in under 20 posts? That's circling the wagons, yeah. <br/><br/>But of course I have some sort of goal. I'm not looking for advice per se; BFA has lots of it and it's generally quite good. I guess it's sort of a combination AP review, a sort of query to see if others have run into similar (or different!) issues, and just starting a conversation about the game and how to get it from a very very good game (as I said it was in the very first post, thinking that'd be enough to prevent early wagon-circling) to a great game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304257/#Comment_304257" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-13T14:51:20+00:00" title="December 13, 2010  2:51PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brendan:<br/><br/>Good post, thanks. <br/><br/>Re "mooks" -- that's totally shorthand. I'm sorry that wasn't clearer. Of course everyone has a name. Of course. But for the purposes of this conversation, "the mooks" was quicker than "Dremmer, Balls, Partridge and Snow are all beaten to death with baseball bats while they stare at the supernatural stripper."<br/><br/>The Arresting Skinner thing is kind of a sideshow anyway. I get that non-fights are one way around that -- plagues or shortages or whatever. Yup, got it. But in terms of the axes of efficacy (I remember that thread as well, also can't find it -- I think it's in blood and guts), the "I instantly and irreversably end this intracharacter conflict" move isn't just effective, it is (IME!) the least interesting move possible.<br/><br/>Blending the playbooks: So what I've seen in play is this. There's a pretty small body of best-in-class moves -- Arresting Skinner, Not to be Fucked With, Juggernaut arguably, the Angel's healing move, others -- that find their way onto my players' playbooks at the earliest opportunity. The player doesn't really matter, I've seen this among about 12 different players so far. There's this tension between taking effective-but-boring moves, and the highly variable moves that might kind of nudge a scene strongly in a direction but also carry with them implied or explicit danger. This is the system creating a conflict of interest, IMO. If the goal of the MC is to make the characters' lives not-boring, why put additional strain on the MC by introducing explicitly boring moves?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304260/#Comment_304260" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-13T14:54:00+00:00" title="December 13, 2010  2:54PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite> I'm not a wizard.</blockquote>\nI have my doubts about this bit, too.<br/><br/>Paul,<br/><br/>I've experienced some similar difficulties in some cases. Specifically:<br/><br/>Sieze by Force: I almost never allow "I seize his life by force" now. I'll say "Cool, how?" and they say "I shoot him in the fucking face" and I say "Ok, what for?" and usually unless they're straight-up executing the guy, it's Go Aggro, which makes things way clearer. Sometimes you're siezing their position by force. That's fixed the problem mostly, I think. It remains to be seen.<br/><br/>I sometimes find it kind of exhausting to run also, but I think maybe not for the same reasons you do. I don't find the MC moves to be a constraint. In fact, they're helpful. When I've got a half-dozen or so competing agendas and NPC goals all vying for attention, and I'm trying to juggle them all in my head, it's cool to be able to stop, pick a threat, pick a move, and go with it. To be honest though, 90% of the time I'm not thinking in terms of threats and moves. I'm thinking about the specific NPCs, the resources available to them, what they want, and how they'll get it. Usually that results in something that looks just like a threat and a move. Sometimes it's hard to keep all that stuff up in the air though. I think the formal structure of threats and moves is helpful to me there.<br/><br/>You're right that, depending on the game, a lot of adversity comes from the MC though.<br/><br/>So, I can understand some of the points you've raised. I've not used the optional battle moves or "An Arresting Skinner", so I can't comment on that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304263/#Comment_304263" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-13T15:10:33+00:00" title="December 13, 2010  3:10PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So here's what I'm saying:<br/><br/>* AW is a good game<br/>* Vincent is a good person<br/>* I'm enjoying my games<br/>* I plan to continue playing<br/>* There are some structural issues I feel keep the game from accomplishing all it can<br/><br/>Here's what I'm not saying:<br/><br/>* AW is broken and nothing anyone can say will change my mind<br/>* I hate playing this game<br/>* I want/need help fixing my group or my session<br/><br/>Not sure if that wasn't clear earlier.

I definitely wasn't meaning to say "stop playing the game" or "stop fucking it up."  I was trying to say that I know of at least one way to approach the game where those issues stop being a problem. But if you only want to talk about the structure of the game and not about how different groups interface with that structure, then cool, I can deal with that.  Some of my previous suggestions still apply but others of them don't.  In any event, thanks for clarifying what you want out of this thread; that definitely helps.<br/><br/>For clarification on my side: I've played nearly 20 sessions of AW so far, with John running my first campaign and playing in the second one, that Tony ran. John's instincts for the game are way more developed than mine and I haven't run it more than a couple times yet, but we talk about AW a lot -- most often about the attitude necessary for getting the best out of the game. So that's why my mind went right there first. All I can say is that, from a different perspective, "An Arresting Skinner" makes totally perfect sense, just like the Battlebabe move "Visions of Death" that lets you instantly kill people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304288/#Comment_304288" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-13T19:30:04+00:00" title="December 13, 2010  7:30PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 13, 2010 7:47PM by Bret_Gillan.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Am I the only one not keep a running tally of how many AW games I've played?<br/><br/>And Paul, between this thread and the conversations we've had off-board, I've been trying to think of situations in my games where the situations you describe would be a problem and they wouldn't, and I think it's because of the PC-NPC-PC triangles. I feel like we'd need to talk about the situations deeper than 'some guys show up and are a problem and the PCs kill them" which would be a pretty in-depth discussion.<br/><br/>I think the answer is in the book where Vincent says, "Look for where the PCs aren't in control and push there." So, clearly the PCs are in control of who lives and who dies. What aren't they in control of? What if there's a water filtration system and only this specific crew knows how to maintain it, and they start causing problems? What if the only medic in town decides to make a power play? How do they deal with that? What if their hypnotic murder powers start reasonably freaking out people who've witnessed it and a mob thinks the Battlebabe is some psycho fuck maelstrom monstrosity that needs to die? Wait, what if the <i>maelstrom</i> starts telling people that? Or taking credit for it all (in its weird Maelstrom way)?<br/><br/>I think when the players have designed their characters to kill anything, then the only way to pose some interesting problems is to ask "what if..." that to you speaks of apocalyptica where easy murder is not a solution. I can think of half of the problems in my games as easily resolvable with murder. The other half - poisoned water supplies, weird weather, bodies being switched, etc. were not things you could really fix that way though. It sounds to me like a lack of diversity of problems.<br/><br/>As for the rest I never use optional battle moves. I think "take definite hold" is probably up to whoever's definition but as MC I take it to mean "I can't take it away the very next time they blow a roll." And I'm on with you Help/Hinder. My players only ended up using it when the person was a +1 away from the next level of success and as GM I felt it was steep to make a move over a failed Help roll. Of course, you can make "as hard a move as you like" which could just be announcing future badness or something else that is interesting but not damaging.<br/><br/>And I've found running it to be different kinds of tiring and stressful. At first getting used to the Moves was tiring. Now I'm a little tired of the prep that goes into Fronts. Oh, and a string of failures makes me want to take a nap. Having to make move after move as your players fail-fail-fail?

Especially yours Bret -- good point about control. This sort of brings up further questions/concerns about the core aesthetic of the game, like if it's really a good idea to direct the fiction away from what the characters are good at simply because they're so good at it that there's no tension. I'm not loving the solution of taking the battlebabe out of battle just because her Arresting Skinner move makes battle (largely) irrelevant. However, I am definitely seeing the possibilities of exploring how NPCs react to the fact she's so eager/willing to take her clothes off.<br/><br/>John, check my math on the issue(s) I'm seeing with the optional battle moves, in particular how covering fire interacts with the countdown:<br/><br/>1) 0-9pm is incidental fire (0-1 harm) in any case. Harm isn't the thing that's going to drive combat in the first three rounds. It'll be other stuff -- having your stuff taken from you, ugly choices, etc. etc. <br/><br/>2) When you provide covering fire, the point is to keep someone from coming under concentrated fire. So if you do that prior to 9pm on the clock, that effect is already in place. For the most part, our battles are long over before 9pm -- just bring out the Arresting Skinner ;-)<br/><br/>Is there a let-it-ride type thing in AW I wasn't aware of? That is, if I lay down covering fire at 0 or 3, say, is that still in place unless/until something changes that fact? Like someone starts shooting at me and I have to Act Under Fire to keep providing cover fire? Basically it's unclear to me how long covering fire lasts. Right now I'm assuming it lasts through the tick, and then on the next tick everyone does something new.<br/><br/>Re creative exhaustion: I've been thinking more on this and I have more observations. <br/><br/>* I feel like there's an inherent contradiction between "play to find out what happens" and constructing your Fronts. At least for me, Front building is a pretty lengthy and thoughtful process. Inevitably, when you do something thoughtful and lengthy, you end up with some investment. So I've got (at least) a little investment in how my various threats are going to play out. But that's in conflict with both "play to find out" and "no status quos". I'm fine with letting threats play out however they're gonna play out, but I definitely feel some resistance to updating my threats. I would greatly prefer the game run itself a bit more than it does. At first it looked like threats were AW's way of running itself, but in fact that's not at all the point of that design. Which is too bad, because as a GM I've already got well developed instincts for maintaining forward movement in the fiction.<br/><br/>* There's definitely a different vibe, at least in my head, between setting and maintaining your own pace as a GM and having the system mandate a pace. I don't know that I, personally, benefit from being told when to talk. So the player makes a move and fucks it up, and now it's on me to start talking. The funny thing is, this is something I already do (of course) when I GM: the player wants to do something, and then we talk about what actually happens. So I don't know. It might be the combination of "start talking now" + "when you open your mouth, one of these 10-15 things will mandate what you can say." And, yeah, of course, those 10-15 MC moves are so broad they probably cover what I'd say anyway. But it still takes that little bit extra brain juice to a) come up with what happens and b) validate that against the moves. Or in reverse, a) look at the moves and b) validate the move against what I'm about to say.<br/><br/>So either/both/neither of those may be factors as well in my sub-86-plays experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway" title="Brendan_Conway"><img alt="Brendan_Conway" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway">Brendan_Conway</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304358/#Comment_304358" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-14T09:23:03+00:00" title="December 14, 2010  9:23AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eeeeeenteresting. <br/><br/>For pushing at them where they aren't in control: I think there's an interesting tension here. You push at the Battlebabe, trying to get her when she's not in combat. But she's going to be striving to get herself in combat. In other words, even as you try to push at where they aren't in control, players are likely to be either (a) trying to get in control, or (b) trying to move the conflict to a place where they are in control. It's those two conflicts that seem to drive the game, and it's what makes it a fair fight, I think. So you can go ahead, corner her in a situation where Arresting Skinner won't help. Then it's down to her to get into a situation where it will help.<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>I feel like there's an inherent contradiction between "play to find out what happens" and constructing your Fronts.</blockquote>\nFull disclosure: My MC-ing experience is absurdly limited, so take everything I say with a grain of salt. But it seems to me that this is much the same thing as I mentioned above. You construct your front, and like you say, you know where it's going...but without PC intervention. You know that, if left alone, the front will do this, this, and that. The interesting part, the "playing to find out what happens," is discovering what the PCs do. If they don't do anything, then the front goes on just like you planned, but if they interact with it at all, chances are that new stuff will crop up in some form or another. <br/><br/>Although to be honest, I'm not sure I fully understand what you're looking for when you say that you want the game to "run itself". Could you elaborate on that a bit for me, please?<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>So what I've seen in play is this. There's a pretty small body of best-in-class moves -- Arresting Skinner, Not to be Fucked With, Juggernaut arguably, the Angel's healing move, others -- that find their way onto my players' playbooks at the earliest opportunity. The player doesn't really matter, I've seen this among about 12 different players so far. There's this tension between taking effective-but-boring moves, and the highly variable moves that might kind of nudge a scene strongly in a direction but also carry with them implied or explicit danger. This is the system creating a conflict of interest, IMO. If the goal of the MC is to make the characters' lives not-boring, why put additional strain on the MC by introducing explicitly boring moves?</blockquote>\nI just wanted to hit this last point, too, because this seemed really interesting to me. This feels utterly different from my own experience with play. Those moves, like the angel's healing move and NTBFW, they went to the characters who had the appropriate playbooks, but no one else has touched them. The Healing Touch of the angel, if that's what you're referring to, that was taken by my Brainer, but the Angel has in turn not taken it, and no one else has, either. I think we all sort of subconsciously agreed that it would feel wrong; my Brainer has it because he figured out how to channel ghosts into people's bodies to heal them (long story), so it doesn't quite fit that anybody else would. Likewise, our Gunlugger is a behemoth of death and destruction; nobody fits that bill, so NTBFW would just feel wrong in anybody else's hands, regardless of mechanical benefit. <br/><br/>I'm not at all saying "you're doing it wrong," to be clear. I'm just saying that perhaps this is one of the divergence points, that other people have had different experiences, so it's hard to come at the issue from the same angle. Honestly, I would go with John Harper's suggestion, then, of just saying "You can only take certain moves from other playbooks," because it feels like the answer is a certain amount of editorial authority on somebody's part. The players don't seem to be exerting it, so maybe you should? At the same time, I can certainly see the abhorrence of saying to the players, "Nah, you can't take that move which according to the rules should be available to you."

So I think my players are very much hewing to the intended play style and aesthetic. There aren't any Savvyheads with out-of-the-blue NTBFW moves or anything.<br/><br/>Re "running itself". Right. Some RPGs prompt me with lots of good, albeit constrained, ideas on where to direct the action at any given moment in play. Mouse Guard for example, IMO the closest thing to AW to run, tells us that on any given failure you get either a twist or a condition. Twists in turn are restricted to one of five kinds of challenges, and you can't play the same kind of challenge twice in a row. Easy, fun, and the twists mostly emerge straight out of the fiction. I find it runs itself. I feel like AW presents an even longer, richer list of "what to do next" options, but rather than treating them as creative prompts -- as I did when I first started playing -- they now feel like validation points. IOW, when it's time for the MC to start talking, rather than just saying "okay, cool, here's a threat countdown over here on my grotesque that seems appropriate, let's go with that," I feel myself passing through several validation points:<br/><br/>1) Is there an appropriate threat out there among my fronts?<br/>2) What does that threat represent?<br/>3) What move can I make to advance the threat's thing?<br/><br/>Inside my first, say, 10 sessions of AW, the fronts/threats/moves matrix was this fun list of creative prompts. And fun prompts = "the game runs itself" in Paul-speak. At maybe the 15th-or-so session, they felt less like prompts and more like rules. Even when I just discard the prompts and do whatever I want to do, and whatever I want to do fits inside a move <i>anyway</i>, it's the extra effort of, you know, making sure I'm not breaking the rules. That's my current best theory on why the game is exhausting to run for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304370/#Comment_304370" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-14T10:02:23+00:00" title="December 14, 2010 10:02AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (This is just a quick note to say that this thread is really thought-provoking for me, out here in the gallery, so thanks, everyone, for taking the time to talk it out.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304372/#Comment_304372" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-14T10:03:39+00:00" title="December 14, 2010 10:03AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brendan Conway</cite>You push at the Battlebabe, trying to get her when she's not in combat. But she's going to be striving to get herself in combat. In other words, even as you try to push at where they aren't in control, players are likely to be either (a) trying to get in control, or (b) trying to move the conflict to a place where they are in control. It's those two conflicts that seem to drive the game, and it's what makes it a fair fight, I think. So you can go ahead, corner her in a situation where Arresting Skinner won't help. Then it's down to her to get into a situation where it will help.</blockquote>\nWhoa, whoa, what?  Can you talk me through that Brendan, because that seems like a really alien, confrontational GM style to me, especially for Apocalypse World.<br/><br/>I mean, in my mind, if I'm running the game for a Battlebabe who's a no-questions-asked, straight-up killer, then I feel like it's my job to 1) give her an assortment of interesting people who need killing in interesting ways for interesting reasons, i.e. be helpful, and 2) keeping her life interesting by putting her in different sorts of situations where killing only really gets her so far, i.e. move slightly tangential, as well as parallel, to her desires.  But I don't really feel like I'm supposed to oppose her.<br/><br/>So, like, maybe there's some guy Horse-Face who she's been aching to kill for some previously-established fictional reason, but he knows she's coming for him, so he's buried himself in a fallout shelter deep in an abandoned uranium mine filled with giant, semi-intelligent mutated bats.  And I'm rooting for the PCs, right?  So I'm excited to see how she (and/or the other PCs) is going to make it through the bat-filled uranium mine, break into the fallout shelter, and kill the dude.  Because I'm pretty sure she can do it if she wants to.  If the mine turns out cool enough, it might become its own threat later, right? Because who knows what might be down there.  And maybe one of the PCs will eventually decide to take a mutant bat as a second PC.  That could only be awesome.<br/><br/>But you never have just one threat going at a time, right?  So maybe there's some street urchin (or group of street urchins) who's been watching her and decided that she's the greatest person they've ever seen.  I mean, she stuns people by stripping and then kills them.  That's nuts.  I'm not sure if they're in love or lust with her, probably some of that, but, really, they just worship her and want to be around her and, even more, to BE her.  So they're going to follow her into this uranium mine full of crazy bat-men and try to help her as much as possible, possibly by getting themselves killed.  Like the mine, this is a *helpful* threat, but a tangential one.  She wants to kill this guy and the urchins want to help, even though she probably doesn't want their help.  If she decides to leave the soon-to-be-dead guy in his fallout shelter, maybe the urchins will go after him anyway. Or maybe they will start a nude death cult where they wander the city naked and start offing random people.  Plenty of potential there.<br/><br/>And maybe there's one of the street urchins that looks really, really familiar to the Battlebabe, a little girl whose face she definitely feels like she's seen before (might be worth asking the Psychic Maelstrom about, maybe?).  I don't have an agenda or pre-set answer for why the urchin is familiar; it just sounds like an interesting detail.  If she asks the Maelstrom or Reads a Person, I can always ask the player questions ("Where do you think you saw her before? Which person in your past does she look like?").<br/><br/>And then there's whatever else is already going on with other other PCs and their various inter-character issues and the PC-NPC-PC triangles that have been previously setup, right?  Because none of the previous stuff happens in isolation.<br/><br/>I mean, really, you have enough crap to keep track of -- and to keep the game moving -- just *being helpful* (i.e. a fan of the PCs) and *being interesting* (make their lives interesting) that taking the time and energy to challenge them where they are weak -- which is what I read you as suggesting -- seems unnecessary.  Honestly, it sounds like way too much work to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway" title="Brendan_Conway"><img alt="Brendan_Conway" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway">Brendan_Conway</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304381/#Comment_304381" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-14T11:14:04+00:00" title="December 14, 2010 11:14AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh. Nude death cult. Totally want to steal that. <br/><br/>I mean no offense by this, but I think you're reading a little too much into what I said. What I was saying, ultimately, was that there is that principle, push at them where they aren't in control. If the Battlebabe is in control in battle, then fine, throw some strong non-battle stuff at her. Which is really all in the example you provided above (fantastic example by the way, seriously cool beans, and I'm really going to steal that nude death cult). And then it's all about how she deals with it. <br/><br/>I think, to rephrase what I was saying, it's your job to throw shit at them of all sorts. Sometimes, maybe, it can be solved in exactly the way they're best at, without issue. Sometimes, they're going to have to maneuver things to solve it according to their best capabilities. That's up to them, and I think it's totally within the scope of the game to say "I'm a fan of you! I want to see how you solve this problem, which really isn't within the normal scope of your abilities!"<br/><br/>And I think the other part of it is that I was speaking from a dual viewpoint, which I didn't make entirely clear. If you're thinking about things from the perspective of a character in the fiction who actively wants to take down the Battlebabe and who knows she's wicked awesome in battle, he's going to steer clear of confronting her in battle. He's going to actively come at her in non-battle ways. And you play him. You, the MC, totally want the Battlebabe to trash his ass somehow, and you're excited to find out how. But you, standing in for this schmuck, also want to infect the Battlebabe with the nightmare plague, so her skin sloughs off long before she can stick a knife in your face. You both want her to die and not die, although ultimately, it's really you as the MC that matters. <br/><br/>To try to rephrase it one more time, so as to explain myself so I don't sound antagonist and psychotic...I think I was reacting to what Paul had said, quoted below:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>This sort of brings up further questions/concerns about the core aesthetic of the game, like if it's really a good idea to direct the fiction away from what the characters are good at simply because they're so good at it that there's no tension. I'm not loving the solution of taking the battlebabe out of battle just because her Arresting Skinner move makes battle (largely) irrelevant. However, I am definitely seeing the possibilities of exploring how NPCs react to the fact she's so eager/willing to take her clothes off.</blockquote>\nI read this as sort of, "I'm hesitant to hit them where they aren't as good on the primary basis that they aren't as good there." And my response to that is, come on. Hit 'em. They'll prove they're awesome anyway. At least as I work as a player, I will be deviously trying to rethink a situation so that I can use the things I'm best at, and I think as an MC, I would be thrilled to see that. And this is just what I see as the full interpretation of that "Push where they aren't in control" tenet.<br/><br/>So, to sum up, I'm not necessarily saying, actively go at them in the places where they aren't particularly good. I actually think you hit it very well in your example. Throw so many different challenges at them, so that some of them, at least, will be things they have to scramble to deal with, even if others, they can stomp on. <br/><br/>Am I making sense/do I sound not-psychotic?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304385/#Comment_304385" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-14T11:30:36+00:00" title="December 14, 2010 11:30AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 14, 2010 11:31AM by John_Harper.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.

My eyebrow jumps up and I shake my head. That (bolded) phrase is like a flashing red light to me. Direct the fiction? That's, like, the opposite of what the AW tools are supposed to support. It is SO not the MC's job to direct the fiction.<br/><br/>But maybe that's not what you meant. Or maybe you <i>think</i> that's not what you meant, but subconsciously, still, that's how you're MCing.

Um, oops? Good point there, John. Thanks. Please nit-pick away about that kind of stuff.<br/><br/>So, if you don't mind me asking, are you of the opinion that AW essentially runs itself, in the manner to which Paul referred above? That you set it up, and wind the crank in the first session, and then periodically it might need a little wind here and there, but otherwise it just goes (which is a slightly different definition than that which Paul applies)? That's what it sort of sounds like. No conflicts, no directing fiction, just playing to see what happens, right? <br/><br/>I get that you basically think the book is right, and you should just do what the darned thing says. Makes sense to me. But I'm kind of curious if (outside of the now well-known seize-peripheral thing) there's any clear, definitive principle which you apply which might not be stated in the book. Any such principle might be the difference between, as Paul put it in the original topic, a good game and a great game.<br/><br/>Again, to reiterate my position, my MCing experience is very limited. I mostly see things from a player's point of view, where I'm worried much more about how I'm going to convince the mean ol' hardholder that I didn't murder all those women, than I am about how the game is actually functioning, and I'm hoping to someday be able to MC well, so I'm interested in any and all input.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304391/#Comment_304391" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-14T11:44:10+00:00" title="December 14, 2010 11:44AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It may very well just be a matter of terminology, John. <br/><br/>Like for example, I look at the process of choosing moves as "directing the fiction."

It's just that, when I try to think of a way to talk about MCing that isn't already in the book, I'm at a loss. I think it's a really comprehensive and clear explanation of the job and how to do it.<br/><br/>The issue comes in with stuff like, "Play to find out what happens." We can all look each other in the eye and say, "Yep, totally. I get it. I'm doing that." But... are we really? Maybe. If someone tells me that they're having problems with the MC job, and then drops a few red-flag phrases in their posts, I have to start to wonder (sorry, Paul, I don't mean for that to sound like a dig at you). It makes me think, "Are they <i>really</i> playing to find out what happens? For reals? Or are they still doing that 'light hand on the tiller' thing that we get so good at as GMs. Or one of a thousand other little GMing habits to steer the game, make challenges, drive toward planned events, etc. etc.<br/><br/>And that's just one part of the agenda. There are two others, plus all the principles and moves. To what degree is all of that coming together at the table? I have no idea, and I doubt that's something that can be communicated over a forum.<br/><br/>My instinct, I guess, when someone has a problem with a game (any game) is to ask, very sincerely, "Are you <i>really</i> doing what the game expects you to do, or are you fighting it somewhere?" I can't make that assessment for anyone else, but I can suggest that it's worth thinking really deeply about.<br/><br/>Having said all that, I don't think there's only "one right way" to play a game. There are a zillion ways to play AW and have fun. But it's impossibly hard to talk about the zillion possible ways. When someone is having issues, and wants advice and discussion, I think it's very helpful to establish a baseline of understanding. Are you playing it the way I play it? Are we on the same page? Pointing at the book as common ground for discussion is expedient, but sometimes looks doctrinal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304402/#Comment_304402" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-14T13:03:38+00:00" title="December 14, 2010  1:03PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 15, 2010 10:09AM by J_Walton.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Brendan:</b> No worries. I don't think you're some kind of psychotic aggressive dude. I was just trying to say that I don't think "hit the characters where they are weak" is what an MC is supposed to do.  That might work totally fine for other games, but it's not a part of GMing AW.  If you read my example and your response was, "exactly, hit them where they are weak!" I admit to being a bit baffled, since that's the opposite of the point I was trying to make.  Clearly there's something about how we're interpreting things (like John said) that's different.<br/><br/>It's easy for different approaches to GMing to look similar in practice, yeah? I was just talking to John about how one of the main responsibilities -- perhaps THE main responsibility -- of Burning Wheel GMs is to <i>challenge the characters' beliefs</i>. But sometimes it's easy for GMs to slip into habits learned playing other games and focus on <i>challenge the characters' abilities</i> rather than focusing on their beliefs.  Thinking "How do I make this sufficiently challenging for the characters?" rather than "How can I make them question what they believe in?"  For a while, though, this slippage may not be obvious, especially to the players and especially if the GM is mostly challenging beliefs and only sometimes slipping into challenging their abilities. But then, every once in a while, the characters fight their way through <i>a conflict that no character actually cares about</i> and the players and GM are both left feeling, "Huh, that was weird; why didn't that work?"  This has happened to me several times running Mouse Guard, actually, where I slipped into having challenges for the sake of challenging the characters, not directed at their beliefs at all.  And these conflicts inevitably felt weird, like something critical was missing.  And it was!<br/><br/>Likewise, I think similar things could potentially happen in AW.  Like, maybe if you ran the exact same circumstances that I described above in my example, intending to challenge the players where they were weak, it would work great.  It could even be really, really fun, with no sign that anything weird was going on.  But then, over time, I think you'd start noticing some things feeling weird.  The players might start feeling paranoid, like the MC was just there to hose them, not to be their fan.  Or you might start rolling dice when nobody really cared about what's going on (that's happened in a few weaker AW sessions that I've been in, and frequently it was John who was like "what am I rolling, again? why am I doing that?").<br/><br/>You see what I'm saying?  GMing, especially with talented people involved (and you and Paul sound like really talented folks), isn't a "quick fail" kind of thing, even if the focus or techniques that you're bringing to the table may not be quite right for the game.  That especially holds true if you're generally doing what you're supposed to, but occasionally slipping into other habits.  I've only run AW twice so far, and both times involved me making a lot of mistakes; in the first session I made people roll Act Under Fire all the time as a kind of generic "there should be some degree of challenge here" kind of move, which worked okay in practice, especially in a one-shot.  The players had a great time!  But over time that would lead to serious issues and I have to keep an eye on that next time I run the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway" title="Brendan_Conway"><img alt="Brendan_Conway" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway">Brendan_Conway</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304409/#Comment_304409" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-14T13:47:16+00:00" title="December 14, 2010  1:47PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/John">@John</a>: That makes a tremendous amount of sense to me. With specific reference to AW, then, it sort of sounds like one of the key, unspoken tenets is that you have to wipe your mind clean of all those prior habits which might in any way contradict with the AW habits. Is there a good way to get yourself in that mindset, without effectively brute-forcing it in your brain? I would love to believe that, as an AW MC, I would abandon anything that got in the way of the principles as Vincent set them out, but I'm a bit worried that there would still be some fragments lodged in there, causing hiccups in the game. This thread has kind of convinced me of that even further. Is there a "reset button" or "palate cleanser" that you'd suggest? Did you shift into the base mindset suggested by the book with ease, or with great effort? I'm also thinking that those questions are a bit like asking for you to provide a magic spell to make AW work, and you've already attested to your non-wizardness. So, in lieu of that, is there anything in particular you might suggest to spot red flags in our own games? You've pointed out a couple prominent ones above...any others leap to mind? <br/><br/>(Sorry if this is derailing the thread, feel free to yell at me if it is.)<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Jonathan">@Jonathan</a>: Yeah, I think I see what you're saying (and thanks for the kind comment about talent). I think, the way I saw your example was that you were throwing any number of situations at the Battlebabe, some of which were clearly poorly designed for that Battlebabe. She's a no-questions-asked, straight-up killer, right? The gang of urchins that follows her and might eventually turn into her nude death cult (you'll have to forgive me, as an MC, I would be driving the fiction straight towards that nude death cult with an iron fist on the rudder, because I can't not...I mean...nude death cult!)...well, she's ill-equipped to deal with them. She's a killer, sure, but, what, she's going to kill a bunch of stupid kids who admire her? They're not immediately harming her, really, they're just causing trouble for everyone, and it's trouble for which eventually she might be blamed. That seems to me like hitting her where she's not in control, where she's weaker, because she's not immediately suited for dealing with that threat. That's how I see it as a confirming example. <br/><br/>I'm also curious about the issue of challenging the players. Yeah, I agree wholeheartedly that it's ridiculous to say "Okay, it needs to be more of a challenge to beat these guys, so, guess what? They have a tank!", and it's much better to say, "So, I've been dropping hints that these guys have been rebuilding and salvaging a tank for the better part of six sessions, and now, guess what? They have a tank. Because none of you did anything about it. Nyah." I'm with you. But there is a certain amount of challenge inherently built into the game, isn't there? Isn't that what every NPC being a potential threat means? Every single NPC is a source of challenge to the characters? Not challenge in the success/failure, win/lose way, but challenge in the "How do you deal with this problem?" way. So, no, you don't want to make things hard for the sake of making them hard, but you almost assuredly want to challenge the players in some sense of the word, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304415/#Comment_304415" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-14T14:20:40+00:00" title="December 14, 2010  2:20PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, I feel like this needs to get much more specific in order to be of any use.<br/><br/>1) Could you more fully describe the going's on in your game where the Skinner's move, as held by the Battlebabe, was a problem?

Like, at one point, in a very off-hand way, one player mentioned that he used to have a wife, and two or three weeks later I knew (assumed) he wouldn't remember it nor care about it in the midst of all the shit going down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher" title="Christopher"><img alt="Christopher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher">Christopher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304501/#Comment_304501" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-15T05:21:05+00:00" title="December 15, 2010  5:21AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 15, 2010 5:23AM by Christopher.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, and I've got to jump on your take on arresting skinner. It's a GREAT move and it TOTALLY extends "conflicts", as you put it. If you're thinking of it in a sense of "this one robbery" is a self contained "conflict" then sure, the move might "win" that. But when the robbed parties show up three hours later with friends to get three kinds of crazy on them, then yes, that conflict has been extended.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe very fact that arresting skinner takes control away from other people, other NPCs and PCs, is what makes it so effective and interesting as a move. How can ANYONE deal with that? It's a con. It's a grift. Like most of the skinner moves, there's an (almost) supernatural quality to them. The move doesn't say that the effected parties are in love with them or that they like the skinner.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have NEVER seen that move used on another PC without it resulting in at least a debility for the skinner. Never.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Hm. I dunno. We play twice a month, and I feel like the questions I ask have become less relevant as time goes on.

Like, if he wouldn't care about a wife, why would he say that? "I've used to have a kid, but I don't care about that, don't bring it up again." Why don't they remember parts of their character or care about them?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe MC has to ask questions that he cares about the answers to and the player has to answer the questions in a way that makes them care about it to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>[AW] Getting from good

to characters. Dunno what that'd be. Mmmaybe add a couple questions to the character creation bit, stuff other than how the character looks. I'm not at all persuaded that the moves are flags at all.</blockquote>\nThe lack of explicit flags has been really tough for me as an MC of Apocalypse World.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hans chung-otterson</cite>Hm.

Like, I ask a question, and the player answers, but I have so many other things to keep track of (Fronts &amp; NPCs and trying to make those triangles) that I forget about them and the players don't remember their answers from one session to the next nor seem to care about them.</blockquote>\nI want to echo this.<br/><br/>I've had a blast playing Apocalypse World (haven't MCed yet). Several of my friends who only play D&amp;D, Pathfinder, and Shadowrun have bought it and started running AW. They really like it. But the different MCs have all echoed some of what Hans is saying. <br/><br/>Also, from talking to and observing different groups, almost everyone seems to forget to consistently roll+harm taken, consistently update HX, confuse Go Aggro and Seize by Force, sometimes use Manipulate without leverage, seem confused by the optional battle moves, and feel highlight stats is a bit jarring. That said, almost all of the players I've spoken to have had a blast playing. They love the classes, the moves, the stats, sex moves, XP, choosing moves from different classes, gear, the choices moves give them, how rolling works, how the MC doesn't roll, MC moves, and they all love Vincent's voice in the book. So lots of love! And the potential issues I've listed are smaller than the issues they are used to dealing with when they run RPGs like Shadowrun, so in context these aren't huge issues. <br/><br/>But the MCs often feel a little overwhelmed and definitely challenged. Not that much different from when they run other games but not as easy as they first thought. I wanted to voice this because I feel sometimes it's easy to forget many gamers don't spend much or any time reading about games online, going to official game forums, or have experience with previous games that might inform how to play. So what's not a big deal for many of us, may be an obstacle for other people.  Nothing that's not solvable.

It's just not something I've seen or even something that I think COULD be a system problem. I feel like this is a group problem. "When you take harm, roll+harm" is about as simple as it gets.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think every one of the "problems" that are listed consistently about AW are that of people who are very experienced with roleplaying games bringing their own baggage and skills from other games in AW.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Go Aggro/Seize debate is a great example. The book explains the difference very well and after three or four times, I or anyone I've ever played with haven't had any problem at all differentiating the two. But I read actual play reports and it seems that people who play a lot of games want the rule for Seize to be "When I hurt someone..." and the rule for Aggro to be "When I threaten someone..."<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't think these responses have anything to do with the game or the text. I think they have to do with gamer baggage.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike this:\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Maybe add some sort of "what do you want?" type flagging element to characters. Dunno what that'd be. Mmmaybe add a couple questions to the character creation bit, stuff other than how the character looks. I'm not at all persuaded that the moves are flags at all.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nThis is SO not an issue. This is the MC asking for a way to ask his players what they want. Just ASK them. "What does Krieder want? What's she looking for right now?" "Ask questions like crazy" It's right there. "What does Krieder think about Exit?" "Why doesn't she like him?" "How has he betrayed her in the past?" "He did something terrible to her sister. What was it?"<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't understand the complaint of lack of flags.

The narrative gets rich really quickly as the threats pile up.  It's a world of scarcity with many problems and people that need something.  I sometimes feel overwhelmed with a lot of games I run though.  Tracking a lot of details well is a personal weakness.<br><br>However I do think that Flags are one of Apocalypse World's strongest features and my experience of play has been that MC questions are maybe the core of the gameplay.<br><br>There's an NPC lieutenant that got in the face of, um, The Faceless in a recent session.  The PC left the NPC pretty messed up and hanging in a barbed wire fence.  While prepping for the next session I realized that I'd neglected to jot down the name of that NPC, the color that went with him, who I'd said he's connected to even.  I realized there were a few other details that I forgot to note and my memory has failed me here and there.<br><br>But those MC questions I ask during the 1st session and when someone opens their brain to the maelstrom?  Damn, that's the time to slow down and take some notes because all that stuff has been golden.  That's the time during gameplay that I'm getting serious information about what the players' characters care about and that's how I know what kind of NPC-PC-NPC triangles to set up to make the whole game hum.<br><br>After you ask your questions, lean back and provide visual cues that the player has all the time in the world to think about the answers so that what comes out is important to them, central to their character.  Listen, jot down some notes and ask a pointed follow-up question to bake in their answer and/or clarify their meaning.  Apocalypse World is the first game that's given me express permission to do that.  What that does, or should do, towards group expectations about the form play takes is magical.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304543/#Comment_304543" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-15T08:57:39+00:00" title="December 15, 2010  8:57AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christopher, I both agree and disagree with you. Let me see if I can explain why. <br><br>I agree that as written, devoid of the baggage we as people bring into it, the Apocalypse World mechanics don't have most of the issues I've described above (like rolling +harm taken). And when I say baggage, I don't mean baggage from playing other games, just baggage from being human. <br/><br/>If you were to take the basic AW system and make it into a computer simulation devoid of human input, not all of AW would work (since it relies heavily on human input) but many of these issues wouldn't be issues at all. The computer would never forget to roll+harm taken. It's codified in the rules, in the system, in the program. So when the event is triggered, the code is executed perfectly.<br/><br/>But the game is made to be played by people, not by machines. So it's not enough to include rules. They have to be communicated in specific ways and then reinforced so that the average (or intended) person will remember to use them. <br/><br/>For example, when you gain 5 XP, you gain an advancement. Technically, you only need 4 XP circles to track your XP. When you gain a 5th XP, you erase all your circles and gain an advancement. With a computer that would work fine. But it caused issues with people. For some people, it made more sense and was easier to use if there were 5 XP circles instead of 4. Even though when you fill in the 5th circle, you then immediately just erase it with the rest of the circles. It's technically a waste of pencil lead and eraser. The mechanic is the same, but something possibly inefficient was needed to make it easier for people to use. <br/><br/>I've done professional usability testing for huge companies and probably game with at least 100+ different people (experienced gamers and new people) every year since I organize gaming events. I get the awesome opportunity to observe a lot of people playing games and to talk in detail with them afterward to better understand what was going on. One thing I've noticed is that experienced gamers, gamers with baggage, gamers who've read the Apocalypse World book twice, and people who have little to no game experience forget to roll+harm. I don't think roll+harm is broken as a mechanic. And I agree that the issue is likely with people. But the game is designed for people so certain changes may need to be made to deal with the baggage we have, as people, not just as gamers.<br/><br/> I have a pretty substantial list, many psychological, of why I believe people consistently forget to roll+harm (other people have even mentioned it on the official AW forums, so there is 100% a pattern). I've even talked to people who say they do use it, and then when I've talked to their players or observed the games, they didn't. It's a tricky thing full of subtleties and in the middle of play, it easy to miss what's going on unless you have outside observers. That said, I'm sure plenty of people don't have these problems. But that doesn't mean other people don't. And that there isn't a pattern explaining why it affects so many people.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304545/#Comment_304545" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-15T09:01:22+00:00" title="December 15, 2010  9:01AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah it took me a lot of sessions to finally start remembering +harm, and I'm still not confident I remember it every time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway" title="Brendan_Conway"><img alt="Brendan_Conway" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway">Brendan_Conway</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304546/#Comment_304546" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-15T09:03:15+00:00" title="December 15, 2010  9:03AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul B., I know you said you were done, and I apologize for this, then, but I'm just curious about one other thing, so that I can maybe put some of what was discussed here together in my own head.

This is me totally lying about being done. One more post.<br/><br/>Well, I don't have a gold standard for what makes a game "great" for me. I think every great game is great in its own way. My list of "great" games is also pretty short. But here are some off-the-hip thoughts of good vs great games (all IMO and IME, so for fuck's sake don't come along demanding I justify my Os and Es)...<br/><br/>Good games:<br/>3:16 -- pretty darned good because it plays fast, it does the military vibe pretty well, it's easy as heck to teach. But it's not great because its endgame gets blurry due to lack of clarity on how the "I win/end this conflict" memory effects work as conflicts move from killin' bugs to scrabbling for ranks. There are also a couple poorly worded rules elsewhere but...it's been a while. Anyway, the game is quite good for a few sessions, then starts to spin apart. This happened three games in a row with three different groups. <br/><br/>Agon -- again, really a good game. Clever system, hackable. However, if the players don't understand/appreciate the one-ups-manship baked into the system itself, the system will make them batshit. Fun for a few sessions, largely due to the neat range-band-and-lego-people combat system, but for us the game just kind of ran out of steam -- the premise of throwing your companions under the bus in the quest for glory is probably good for one short-ish campaign. Characters also felt a little static and flat. <br/><br/>Reign -- mostly pretty good, a nice fusion of trad and useful nu-skool ideas. The Company rules don't actually do anything, and that's a disappointment given the centrality of those rules to the game's premise. There are some organizational problems as well, especially once you start using the later releases, and that made it a huge pain in the ass to run as time went on.<br/><br/><br/>Great games:<br/>Burning Wheel -- I feel like this one is great both despite and because of its warts. It is perhaps the most flawed game I have ever played, and yet the things it does well it does extremely well: Supports extended play (although it, too, will fall apart after a *really* long time), clear character arcs that transform the protagonists (and not only in the bildungsroman way), gears-within-gears mechanical interactions that generate ongoing situation, and constant conflict and complications that drive the game along. Mouse Guard gets an honorable mention, particularly for its various GM-facilitating tools, but really it's under the BW aegis. Ditto BE, perhaps even more deeply flawed than BW but man I've gotten a lot of good play out of it.<br/><br/>InSpectres -- simple, easy to teach, tons of prompts for the GM to take and run with, and the Confessional mechanic is very clever. I feel like the Psychic Maelstrom has a lot in common with the Confessional, actually. It's not a long-play game IME but then again it doesn't pretend to be. Super-easy hook that mostly lets the game run on cliches. I can run 1 or 3 sessions of InSpectres and feel like it was time well spent. A great, little game.<br/><br/>Dust Devils -- for whatever reason, I find DD very easy to run. I think it's easy to leverage a well-written Devil into interesting situations. I like the genre and think the game addresses it well. I like the flags and implied history on the character sheet. Despite some problems we've had with the "final scene" mechanic, I've run this maybe a dozen times now and it's been fun every time. An elegant little game, perfect for a 3-6 session run.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher" title="Christopher"><img alt="Christopher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher">Christopher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304566/#Comment_304566" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-15T09:57:02+00:00" title="December 15, 2010  9:57AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I'm feeling you. I don't think AW is a perfect game or anything. It doesn't even do the sort of roleplaying that I want to do most of the time. So I'm not biased here. I have no investment towards AW doing well, which is sort of a meaningless term in indie games anyway. I have my copy of the book; I don't need anything else from it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the harm thing, among others, is just frustrating for me. It's pretty clear and I can't imagine why people don't do it. That's a huge disconnect for me. I'm not the smartest dude in the world and I'm certainly not a computer, but when someone takes harm, they roll the harm.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know the harm roll was added late in the design, so maybe it doesn't flow for some people. I don't know. But just like it obviously frustrates Paul to have people tell him "Well, I never have that problem...", it frustrates me that people <b>do</b> have that problem and respond with "Well, the game's broken". I'd guess that it might fall into the speed at which the moves can build up, and that harm roll happens right after another roll, usually. Maybe the MC's going a little too fast, I don't know. But still, there's no psychosocial excuse in the world for it. It's entirely binary. Did you take harm? If yes, then make a harm roll.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd like a lot of forum communication, things break down into idea protection rather than discussion. Like Paul is certain that this is a huge problem and I'm certain that it's not. The continued SG cultural problem of posters posting threads where they express their opinion and then responding with "I've gotten what I need to out of this thread" when other people post alternative viewpoints is also seriously aggravating.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe attitude of "You disagree with my original statement? Then I don't know why you replied" is seemly indicative of a need to vent about frustrations at the table and not any real call for discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304574/#Comment_304574" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-15T10:21:55+00:00" title="December 15, 2010 10:21AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the record, we often forget to roll +harm too, especially in the middle of an ongoing tense situation.

The players are thinking about which playbooks they want.<br/><br/>I ask, "So... is there still like a military/civilian divide after all these years, or has everyone kind of merged into one big group?"<br/><br/>Chris, who's thinking about the hardholder, says, "Of course there's still a military force! We have to maintain order. We have to stay on mission." And bang, there's his character, loud and clear. Those are practically BW beliefs. I follow up with, "Yes. Order. Of course. So, you're in charge, then?" Chris shifts fully into character and looks at me coldly. "Yes. And I expect to be addressed as 'sir,' soldier."<br/><br/>Later, Ryan's putting the finishing touches on his gunlugger, Chaplain. I ask him, "So, you're like a squad leader right?" He nods. "Okay, your current team is Sam (that's Samantha), Ortiz, Hooks, and Boxer. Which ones are you sleeping with?" Ryan says, "All of them. I have to." "You have to?" Chris cuts in, as the Colonel: "Orders. It's protocol. The population protocol." We're all smiling now. I ask, "So... one of them could be pregnant?" "Yep." Awesome.<br/><br/>"Why are you called Chaplain? Are you the chaplain?" Ryan says no. "I was born on Athena. I have my dad's old armor and weapons. His armor has this cross symbol on it, and people called him chaplain, so I go by that. I don't know what it means. I have some of his old books and things, too. They have crazy stories in them."<br/><br/>I could go on. That setup was full of stuff like that. Flags upon flags.<br/><br/>As an example of how one was used: The opening scene was Sam and Chaplain, out on patrol, when she confronts him about being pregnant and demands his help getting an abortion.

Or was it just, "You have a rival in this town. Who is it, and what's your deal with them?"<br/><br/>2) And, next, how did you turn those answers into flags? (Especially the last one; the first three are pretty obvious.)<br/><br/>3) Finally, how did those flags interact with your MC prep (fronts and threats)?</blockquote>\n<br/><br/>1) Yeah, the questions were simple.<br/><br/>2) Bullit's race with Toyota led to Bullit adopting Rubbin, the only one of Toyota's brood to survive the brutal race.  This led to us seeing what a great father Bullit can be and how he can turn vehicular homocide into a loving relationship.<br/><br/>Baby's lover is still brewing; haven't had an opportunity to cash that one in because I haven't had both Baby's player and Saffron's player in the same room at the same time.<br/><br/>Marsh's mugging led to him befriending a guy who set him up with a job that led to a bomb going off on Bear's bridge, leading to the town being left as a tiny village where squid-eaters stop for the night when they can't make a safer berth.<br/><br/>Dent's friend, Stomp is the new bouncer at Saffron's place but not much has come of that just yet.<br/><br/>Did they turn into flags?  Not in the way that Beliefs or Keys are flags (in BW and TSoY) but AW isn't wired like that.<br/><br/>What those questions created were NPC's they were interested in, events that provoked reactions and situations where they had to make tough decisions or little moments where we learned more about these characters or the world around them.<br/><br/>3) The ways they interacted with the Fronts...well, let's just call Fronts what they are.  Fronts are the shit happening all over the place that the players can choose to either effect or ignore through their actions or inactions.  It didn't effect the Fronts in any crystal clear way but it has left its mark, put pawns in place for the events to come.<br/><br/>Of course Bullit deals with shit differently now that he has an adopted daughter whom he adores.  Of course Dent is a different man knowing that there is another out there almost as fuct up as he is.  Yeah, it seems that Baby get's into these relationships where the other person is way more into her than she is into them; its becoming a pattern with her and will no doubt become something meaningful later.  How Marsh dealt with the mugger was just one in a long line of really messed up Brainer psychic mindfucks he perpetrated on someone who didn't mean shit to him.  <br/><br/>So, we're learning about the characters through those questions and the NPC's in the answers and learning about the world.<br/><br/>And in the end, I reckon, that's the point.<br/><br/>Hope those are helpful answers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304717/#Comment_304717" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-15T18:44:12+00:00" title="December 15, 2010  6:44PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also: rolling+harm taken is optional.

The one about why people don't roll harm. At least we might get something constructive out of this.</blockquote>\nI don't think there is one reason, but any of the following may contribute to it:<br/><br/>- The Suffer Harm move works different than every other move in the game. A hit is bad for the player and a miss is good. <br/><br/>- But a miss being good isn't really that good depending on the situation. Usually it means taking 1 less Harm for something else bad happening to you. It's trading 1 bad thing for another. With the main benefit being that you choose which bad thing. <br/><br/>- The Suffer Harm move sometimes means being kicked while you are down. You often just failed another move, took Harm, and now even more bad things are about to happen to you. Except unlike rolling for other moves, there is no compelling upside. <br/><br/>- Apocalypse World can be brutal but feels softened because the players roll everything. Being hurt is due to something you rolled and failed to accomplish. So when the MC plays a hard move against you, it doesn't feel as bad as if the MC actually rolled moves against you. But the MC reminding you to roll Suffer Harm, feels more like the MC doing something to you. I've seen many MCs feel bad when they remind players to roll Suffer Harm.<br/><br/>- It's a Peripheral Move. <br/><br/>- You don't gain XP for rolling Suffer Harm.<br/><br/>- I've seen quite a few people purposefully "forget" to roll Suffer Harm. Psychologically it's easier to justify "cheating" when you can do so by omission instead or having to proactively take a specific action. It doesn't feel like cheating. <br/><br/>- There aren't built in reminders to roll Suffer Harm. You can forget to roll it and the game moves forward as if nothing was forgotten. Nothing obviously breaks by forgetting to roll it.<br/><br/>I'm sure there is way more that I'm forgetting! <br/><br/>And for some people, the above might be the reason, for others it could be something completely different. But just like the 5 vs 4 XP circles, certain subtle changes may be needed to account for the human side of the equation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304736/#Comment_304736" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-15T21:40:25+00:00" title="December 15, 2010  9:40PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 15, 2010 9:42PM by J_Walton.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's interesting to note, too, that the expanded harm moves were added fairly late in the playtesting process, and consequently are not as fully worked into the rules as some of the other moves.<br/><br/>I can imagine reworking them in a way in which <i>you don't take harm until you make the roll</i>.

In a game that's all about scarcity and the uniqueness of resources, a hit-point system is a little odd to me. Sometimes you take a wound and it's just a number, which doesn't do anything for me. Doesn't drive play, doesn't make anything interesting, doesn't add any hooks to the game world.<br/><br/>I have some ideas for an alternate harm system. I came up with it for my Firefly hack, hoping to impart the urgency that every single wound in that show brings.

The badness accumulating is its own factor\u2014it doesn't need to conspire with future harm to make for even lower totals.<br/><br/>Just brainstorming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304911/#Comment_304911" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-16T16:23:36+00:00" title="December 16, 2010  4:23PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that's good, Will.

This old woman named Frey. She has a huge stockpile squirreled away and doles it out to the hunters and warriors that she deems worthy."<br/><br/>So, there you go. An NPC (who's automatically a threat) who's forming the first part of a triangle. For the first session, I'd make a note to wonder about what front Frey falls under (probably the Home Front, but you never know). When asking questions of the other PCs, I might ask about Frey and see if I can get the other part of the triangle in place.<br/><br/>That's kind of a best-case answer. You can do it this way, too, if the player doesn't have something awesome:<br/><br/>MC: "So, who do you get your ammo from?"<br/>Duke: "Hmmm. I don't know... someone in the holding, I think."<br/>MC: "What about the wise woman we talked about? Maybe she has all the valuable stuff like ammo and she doles it out to those she deems worthy?"<br/>Duke: "Yeah, that's cool."<br/>MC: "Okay. She needs a name. I'm gonna call her... Frey. What's your relationship like?"<br/>Duke: "Oh, she loves me. I'm the best warrior in the holding, after all."<br/>MC: "Cool."<br/><br/>Here's another one:<br/><br/>MC: "So, who do you get your ammo from?"<br/>Duke: "I scrounge for it myself."<br/>MC: "Ah, okay. Where? Is there a ruined city or something nearby? Maybe over here [pointing at the map]."<br/>Duke: "I was thinking there was maybe an abandoned military ship all covered over in ice and snow."<br/>MC: "Awesome."<br/><br/>No NPC that time, but you got an awesome landscape threat out of it. And maybe start wondering about who else knows about the ship, and if anyone lives there, etc. Those can be follow-up questions or material to explore in play.<br/><br/>And again:<br/><br/>MC: "So, who do you get your ammo from?"<br/>Duke: "I scrounge for it myself."<br/>MC: "Ah, okay. The holding has been attacked several times by those raiders Bell (another PC) was talking about. Maybe you just pick it off the dead?"<br/>Duke: "Yeah, sounds good."<br/><br/>Now you have a triangle, a threat that touches two PCs. Bell wants to stop the raids, and Duke maybe does, too, but if the raiders suddenly vanish, his source of ammo goes away.<br/><br/>And you can do that with any question. Either you discover an NPC or other threat, or you learn what they're in control of and therefore what stuff others might want to take from them or trade for. Like, if Duke had said the ammo stockpile was his and he decided who was worthy, that's gold too. You can immediately imagine some people who don't like that situation, others who support him, etc. Triangles and threats.<br/><br/>The easiest triangle method is to simply flip the relationship 180 degrees to finish the connection. Duke says Frey loves him, so you go, okay, she hates Bell. Bell says he hates the raiders, you go, okay, one of the raiders is Duke's sister who was lost in a snowstorm when she was a child. That's super simplistic, but it works great in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304918/#Comment_304918" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-16T17:38:10+00:00" title="December 16, 2010  5:38PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 16, 2010 5:39PM by J_Walton.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>You roll minus harm suffered right now.</blockquote>\nOh, OH. I see what John(skot)'s saying.  Just reverse the way the move's structured so you're not rolling inversely to the other moves. Nevermind.<br/><br/>Isn't the 10+ on the table still as long as you haven't JUST taken 3 harm? Because, by Jenskot's description, harm basically acts as -1forward (i.e. temporary) on your unmodified harm roll. That just means that big wounds, where you take 3+ harm, are necessarily complicated, which doesn't sound too bad to me, but makes them automatically worse than taking 3 harm already is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429207/#Comment_429207" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-07T10:27:21+00:00" title="March  7, 2014 10:27AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Necro-time.

More importantly, just three separate outcomes didn't cover the realistic range of possible harm results. You want a range from something that just stings to something that kills you, right? But it isn't right for a couple of punches to threaten instant death all the time, nor for a massive explosion or concentrated fire from a machine gun to get shrugged off completely on a good roll. The basic move structure doesn't work great here, with just three discrete outcomes.*<br/><br/>I eventually solved the issue by coming up with three separate harm moves which interface with a list of "harm effects". I'm pretty happy with the outcome, and I keep hearing from people who are using these harm rules and having a good time.<br/><br/>Here's the resulting thread:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17665/apocalypse-world-a-more-descriptivevisceral-approach-to-harm" rel="nofollow">Apocalypse World: A more descriptive, visceral approach to harm</a><br/><br/><br/><br/>*: Although it could work if the outcomes depended on the level of harm, instead of the roll itself. Something like "choose one wound tag for each level of harm suffered", that's another possible solution to this issue that occurred to me when I was thinking through the options.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429241/#Comment_429241" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-08T08:22:30+00:00" title="March  8, 2014  8:22AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 9, 2014 5:57PM by AsIf.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like those, and I'll try them.
