The indie RPG movement ushered in a new generation of game designers with unique goals and motivations. These designers have pushed the boundaries of the storytelling medium, finding innovative ways to present collaborative fiction to new audiences.<br/><br/>It\u2019s time the boundaries were pushed even further.<br/><br/>It is with great pleasure that we announce Design Matters, a partnership amongst 6 game designers exploring new methods of marketing and sales. Design Matters is: Clint Krause, Gregor Hutton, Jonathan Walton, Nathan Paoletta, Epidah Ravochal, and Kevin Allen Jr. <br/><br/>Design Matters\u2019 focus is laser sharp. We exists only at and for Gen Con. If you aren\u2019t going to be in Indianapolis this year you will still be able to get a hold of our products, through the same means you always have; but if you are at the convention we hope you stop by and see what we\u2019re offering up. Design Matters has a simple, if lofty goal: to re-imagine the way games and gamers find each other. We aim to attract the person for whom role-playing is just one of many interests in their spectrum of entertainment. While our games are certainly accessible to the hardcore role-player, the array of games presented at our booth appeals to those who may not identify strongly with roleplaying, but who are interested in playing a low-social-commitment game with friends who share their interest in a specific genre or kind of game.<br/><br/>We invite you to participate in this brave new sales experience at Gen Con 2008, booth 1940. Come check us out and discover that yes, in fact, Design Matters.<br/><br/>For more info, come visit <a href="http://www.booth1940.com" rel="nofollow">www.booth1940.com</a>.

The profit-sharing may get rid of the incentive to sell your own product over others, but it still can't work out too well if someone else is profiting from your $20 product when he's selling some crappy little thing for $5.<br/>\n<br/>\nI cant' speak for the Forge on this, but the GPA buys booth space at all the major Gaming conventions and we're starting to spread out into the semi-major ones as well. Usually, these booths can be purchased for less than you would pay individually, shared, and will often be better-positioned on the floor due to us bargaining as a group. We even have a showcase where you don't need to be present, and a Gold Program where your product is automatically hauled from one convention to the next.. and you keep what your product brings in. No brag.. just fact. You can find out more about the GPA at http://thegpa.org.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_159232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159232/#Comment_159232" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-28T19:11:03+00:00" title="July 28, 2008  7:11PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 28, 2008 7:11PM by fnord3125.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Heraldic</cite>Kids, this is nothing new.<br/>Except for the profit-sharing [ . . . ]</blockquote>Which is, at least based on the link Guy pointed at, the whole point?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_159233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159233/#Comment_159233" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-28T19:13:03+00:00" title="July 28, 2008  7:13PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 28, 2008 7:21PM by Elizabeth.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heraldic, what you're missing is that the games work well together, and are uniformly awesome, and the people designing them have specifically written games that reach out to the non-gamer-- so that the hardcore gamer at GenCon can pick up a copy of something their non-gaming buddies might be interested in.<br/><br/>I feel that this is a real selling point, especially for the genre-simulating games that DM is going to have-- specifically, Geiger Counter, Annalise, and Mist-Robed Gate. They're all phenomenal games that any RPG enthusiast would love, but they're also the kind of thing you can bring home and coerce your horror/vampire/kung fu-loving buddies into playing, even if they've turned their nose up at stuff like 4e and Dogs in the Vineyard.<br/><br/>I wish I knew more about stuff like Sweet Agatha and Roanoke.

Our games are designed for a style of play that doesn't require long-term commitment or strong personal identification with being a roleplaying person.<br/><br/>We'll also be running tons of games at Games On Demand, by the by.<br/><br/>Is it gonna be huge? Probably not. I mean, it's our first year, and we're experimenting with some things. But we will certainly be providing a venue that we haven't seen at Gen Con, aimed at people who may not know a lot about these games, but would certainly enjoy them. We expect that we'll find those people, and we look forward to talking and selling to them just as much as interacting with our existing friends and others in the community.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_159249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159249/#Comment_159249" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-28T20:58:18+00:00" title="July 28, 2008  8:58PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Nathan,\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hamsterprophet</cite>Is it gonna be huge?

Heck one of the designers gives their games away for free, which is about as far from profiteering as you can get!<br/><br/>My own booth experiences make me equivocal about the model, just because I can't see why these fine people need it. Yes some people might be keener on selling their own games than other people's, but I hope that isn't true for the majority of us when we work on some shared booth! Last time I did such a thing (at Conpulsion 08) I was quite happy to sell any of the games on the stall to people who came looking. Sure I mentioned my own game along with everyone else's, but the emphasis was on finding a game that suited each customer, not making the customer buy my game. Am I really that different from anyone else? Is this a reaction to things you guys have seen in action elsewhere?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_159296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears" title="Keith Sears"><img alt="Keith Sears" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/898/nD5UFQZP7YUY6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears">Keith Sears</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159296/#Comment_159296" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-29T05:40:28+00:00" title="July 29, 2008  5:40AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Please forgive my hard-nosed attitude when it comes to this.

And I think this quote from you is really key, actually.<br/><br/>I, personally, am pretty satisfied that our products are a good fit together, at roughly the same price point, and offer a range of diverse play and content that customers coming to the booth will find something that they like.<br/><br/>I'm also really confident that my investment of buying into the booth will be covered by a share of the booth sales, since I believe that there is a market for our products (in some general sense). Now, I can't tell which particular books will sell well or not-so-well. But we are sharing the risk of buying the booth and we'll share the reward of any sales. The customers will determine what they like, but as designers we're saying we wouldn't be here without each other as a community.<br/><br/>I think it is an attempt to be openly and honestly mutualistic in supporting each other's books, without the distraction of selling my book over someone else's (or vice versa) or trying to demo or promote one thing over another.<br/><br/>I also think we'll be less about hard sell at the booth given our attitudes and personalities. Kevin and Nate have done a great job of organising the booth and I'm happy to give it a go and see if we can connect with the public and share our games with them.<br/><br/>Some people have said they didn't like the "try a demo" culture (I'm thinking of Neil Gow's bad experience with it at last year's GenCon) and the loud selling of other more traditional booths. Well, here's a booth that's different, does the public actually want to engage with it? We can only offer them it and see if they do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_159319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159319/#Comment_159319" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-29T07:37:23+00:00" title="July 29, 2008  7:37AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey 1940 guys, are you also selling at Gen Con through IPR?

What happens if someone's product sells so much better than the others that they end up losing money? I understand that it is probably the sincere hope of the DM team that this does not happen, but anything can happen. "Going gangbusters," in this manner might be reward in-and-of itself, but for my own erudition I am curious what your (DM's) take on the matter is.<br/><br/>EDIT: I understand that delving too deeply into the topic might dilute a competitive advantage, and am not expecting an exhaustive exploration of the business plan. I understand where you're coming from with regards to having an incentive to keep costs low, but there are certainly more conventional, accounting-style practices that could handle that without some of the risks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_159466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159466/#Comment_159466" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-29T13:12:32+00:00" title="July 29, 2008  1:12PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Rob:</b> That's kinda hard, considering the diversity of stuff we'll be offering.

Unfortunately, I was very tired when I wrote that, missed the point of the opening post and didn't express my point very well.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease accept my apologies if my post upset you. I wasn't trying to imply that anyone's products in booth 1940 were crappy or that anyone participating in the booth is anything less than a good person.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I read it in my weary state, what I got out of it was, "Wer'e sharing a booth at GenCon and this is a new and wonderful thing in marketing!" This upset me because banding together for a booth really isn't a new thing, and I really don't consider profit-sharing to be anything that is going to help with marketing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, now that I have looked the post over a few times, I finally got what is actually great about this effort. Its a tough mission they've decided to take up and I truly believe that it's going to take more than a single GenCon to pull it off.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Move #1: "We aim to attract the person for whom role-playing is just one of many interests in their spectrum of entertainment." I've found that most gamers usually have a wide number of interests, but most game publishers keep targeting the same audience, slicing up the same pie into smaller and smaller slices. They rarely try to bring new people into the hobby and thereby refresh the hobby. This tells me that they will hopefully reach for the untapped audiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Move #2: ". . . who may not identify strongly with roleplaying, but who are interested in playing a low-social-commitment game with friends. . . " This reinforces my above assumption, and tells me that the intent is to gain the interest of those that don't want to spend hours and hours playing an RPG each week. The public view seems to be that an RPG requires big, thick books and hours of prep in order to play. With luck, this view will change over time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to the six of you in booth 1940, I wish you luck and I will be sure to drop by to see what you are doing to accomplish this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_159657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159657/#Comment_159657" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-29T19:37:43+00:00" title="July 29, 2008  7:37PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Data point: so far, all the games that have really caught my eye for GenCon (that I don't already own) are at the Design Matters booth.

We're doing this as an experiment for everyones sake. Our success will be documented publicly, as will our failures. Our goal is to generate some data on selling that EVERYONE can benefit from. Do we plan on being competitive? Yes, but we're going to play with our hands face up. <br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Can you clarify how "new methods of marketing and sales" connects with "exists only at and for Gen Con"?  How is Gen Con a new method?  Why are new methods outside of Gen Con out of scope?<br/></blockquote>\nThis is a great question. Obviously marketing casual games for the soft-core gamer at the biggest gathering of UBER-SERIOUS gamers is a little counter-intuitive. In a perfect world we would be able to market these games effectively in the open air on MTV and Fark and such; but right now we're taking baby steps. Appearing at Gen Con is an experiment, and as I said previously (and will continue to say for as long as people let me, and then some) the entire point of this venture is to learn new things, to try stuff out. There is a distinct demographic of Gen Con attendees that fit the customer profile we're targeting. They are far from the biggest sub-culture at Indy, but they are most certainly present. We want to sell to them in a way they appreciate, personally, in a store front style atmosphere. While not a perfect simulation of a real world storefront experience, it's a step towards that.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>It'd be nice if you listed how much each game would go for <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><a id="Item_40" name="Item_40"></a></blockquote>\nIt totally would be nice. Consider this added to the long but imperative list of things that need to be updated to the site. Really we wanted something up that people could look at and get some ideas about what we're doing. Excellent suggestion.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Hey 1940 guys, are you also selling at Gen Con through IPR?</blockquote>\nI for one most certainly am. I'm not going to speak for my partners but I think the general feeling is that multiple points of sale will serve different audiences. I want games in hands, on tables, worming into peoples play and I'm not going to turn off a perfectly good way for that to happen. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite>I don't quite see the revolution, but I do wish you all luck.</blockquote>\nNaw, not a revolution, just a re-imagining. Revolutions are for fanatics or the oppressed; two things we're decidedly not.
