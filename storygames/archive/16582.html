It's just that easy.<br/><br/>It's inappropriate to be names-dropping just for the sake of it, or to deliberately advertise something, when you actually know it's not really the best game the OP could hope for (for their needs).

And their questions hinge around core focus for their design (i.e., NOT around "how can I balance the math on this die mechanic," but more fundamental issues)? Can folks then suggest, "Hey, well, fifty folks have answered those fundamental questions in twenty-three different ways: have you read any of the prior art?" (Yeah, I used that phrase intentionally: any inventor with no knowledge of prior art in their field is a laughing stock.)<br/><br/>Seems like this general issue has a continuum of behavior, from Encouraged to Nut-Me-Driving.

When folks see a self-promoter, they can choose a variety of responses, from apathy to Nuts-Driven. As it turns out, some members of the moderation team are Nuts-Driven by it; and so the whole focus of the forum is "tuned" (for lack of a better word) to eliminate one of many vectors by which one might self-promote (i.e., suggesting one's own, inferior game). Yet, eliminating design discussion (or even "Designs To Watch" threads used as portals) won't eliminate self-promotion, only remove one vector.<br/><br/>THAT could be yer problem, rite-cher. Baby, bathwater, all that. Except you're throwing out the bathing tub, too; and maybe even saying no one can bathe here at all, even if only a quick whore's bath in the sink. (HAMMER that metaphor, HAMMER it!)<br/><br/>On the other hand, it is YOUR site (not OURS, that's been made clear before), and you can encourage, discourage, ban, etc whatever you want (just like, oh, I'd discourage or delete threads at GLASScutters that tried to sell people on NERO books, right?). Your romper room, your rules.<br/><br/>But on the gripping hand... The Forge got "its reputation" mostly because of Ron (and others') efforts to enforce Encouraged behaviors while driving away or redirecting Nuts-Driven behaviors. So, you know, folks might start to take the same perspective (and I've seen it starting already, here and there: "the Story Games vibe" is becoming a thing, with some negative connotations with some folks... not that y'all probably particularly care about THAT, either...).<br/><br/>Eh, so... yeah. The whole "private/public space" perception, entitlement, all that shit. Some folks' buttons get pressed, when they feel like the "entitlement" arrow only points one way (at "guests" who want to make a space "their own" in whatever manner; but not at "hosts" who by definition CAN'T be entitled because... uh, well... they're entitled to enforce whatever standards they want in their private space).<br/><br/>[Not trying to derail "when is it Encouraged" thrust of this thread.... By all means, carry on with the metrics and techniques that indicate appropriate behavior.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379676/#Comment_379676" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-24T14:08:58+00:00" title="May 24, 2012  2:08PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Todd L</cite>When considering answering someone's request for a recommendation, first think of a game that is a good fit and is unaffiliated with Western Massachussetts.

And their questions hinge around core focus for their design (i.e., NOT around "how can I balance the math on this die mechanic," but more fundamental issues)? Can folks then suggest, "Hey, well, fifty folks have answered those fundamental questions in twenty-three different ways: have you read any of the prior art?" (Yeah, I used that phrase intentionally: any inventor with no knowledge of prior art in their field is a laughing stock.)<br/><br/>Seems like this general issue has a continuum of behavior, from Encouraged to Nut-Me-Driving. The Nut-Me-Driving bits are obvious in their ridiculousness. The Encouraged, likewise (selfless, exacting, good advice). So the trouble is where in the grey zone "The Line" is crossed. As with so many such subjective things--and as with most of the Internet--I encourage generous reading.<br/><br/>I think creativity requires a bit of the ridiculous. You're going to get people who go over old ground or throw out their own heartbreaker version of a particular genre. Saying "Hey, that's already been done" isn't particularly useful because designers will find out on their own and because of bias on the part of the designer (your game is the best game out there until you say otherwise.) I understand wanting to check other people's arrogance and maybe cutting down on the clutter, but that arrogance is part of what drives a creator onward.<br/><br/>Some of the best story games, for instance, borrow pretty heavily from Improv Games and group bonding techniques and one might argue there's no need to reinvent the wheel there. I'm pretty pleased with what's come out of the community so far.<br/><br/>Now, keep in mind that I'm only talking about advice like this when it comes to the creative process. When someone is clearly shopping around for a new system, I can't argue with touting your favorite system. In those areas it helps potential buyers see what's hot and what's not.<br/><br/>But telling people that there's better out there when they're in the middle of trying to construct them mostly serves as an inhibitor. It's not real useful.<br/>(That's why when I do it out of panic or whatever base emotion I'm operating on that day, I try to preface it with my agenda so they'll know whether to ignore me or not.)<br/><br/>Also, I think I may have originally meant to post this in another thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379757/#Comment_379757" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-25T11:15:08+00:00" title="May 25, 2012 11:15AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Arpie</cite>I understand wanting to check other people's arrogance and maybe cutting down on the clutter, but that arrogance is part of what drives a creator onward.</blockquote>I never intended that at all.
