With increasing bleed, the border between player and character becomes more and more transparent. It makes sense to think of the degree of bleed as a measure of how separated different levels of play (actual/inner/meta) are.<br/><br/>Bleed is instrumental for horror role-playing: It is often harder to scare the player through the character than the other way around. An overt secluded dice roll against a player's perception stat is likely to make the character more catious.<br/><br/>A classic example of bleed is when a player's affection for another player carries over into the game or influences her character's perception of the other's character.<br/><br/>Many jeep games rely on bleed either to influence player's actions or to achieve higher purposes in the premise. For example, Fat man down uses bleed to encourage the players to reflect over society's treatment of fat people. Playing Doubt close to home regularly causes bleed as a consequence of using own experiences in the game and re-living relationship situations or reflecting on relationships. Sometimes, the entire purpose of a game is to create bleed.</blockquote>\nThread question: in other media - theatre, arts, literature, others? - we might experience similar phenomena. What are they?

To make a long story short, Stanislavski's system involves a deep analysis of characters motivation, setting his/her objective and finding possible resolutions. It was crucial to him to connect a move or a gesture with a real emotion. The key thing is so called "magic if" -- an actor has to answer himself a question in relation to the character he/she is playing: "What if that happened to me?/What if I were him?". What's also important is to build a reaction basing on 1) elements provided by other actors, 2) his own experiences and feelings (I can't remember if there was any particular name for that technique).<br/>\nIs that what you're looking for?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286275/#Comment_286275" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-14T05:00:22+00:00" title="August 14, 2010  5:00AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 14, 2010 5:07AM by Sebastian.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Nice thread and I look forward to some clever answers like the one above)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there is an element of bleed any time the audience is asked to fill in the blanks. In fact, that dialogue, for many, defines art in opposition to spectacle. When I tell you there is a woman wearing only blue jeans in a room cutting carrots on the kitchen counter, what do you see? Is she facing you? Is her back turned? Is she fat or thin? Is it day time or night? It is the tool of the poet to ask the reader to let himself be shaped by the art. Nevertheless, the reader is the one that is shaped. For me, that's bleed, and that's expression, and that's, I suppose, communication.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpecifically, some authors, particularly those academic fellows, drench their prose with exactitudes. There is a lot of elitism in language. I think that the best use of "bleed" in literature is when the author creates complex meaning with simple words. I read a great line in a book by an Indian author (whom I forget at the moment), which read something like:<br/>\n<br/>\n"and I heard the rain come running across the roof like a boy in bare feet." There is a question being asked of you and your culture, to create the sound and rhythm of that description and to realise it in your mind. I don't know if it differs much from one person to the next, but perhaps it does and perhaps it does not. Nevertheless, it prods for an answer, and asks something of you, the reader. Any time there is that kind of querying, polite, dialogue, I think that is bleed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286304/#Comment_286304" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-14T09:16:29+00:00" title="August 14, 2010  9:16AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Making the reader feel similar emotions to the character is something I've seen in some experimental fiction - I forget the name now - I think it was a Borges story about torture that was cut up and missing parts with the goal of making the reader also feel tortured.  <br>Actually, I think Lost had a similar goal - the characters are lost, the audience is lost.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286327/#Comment_286327" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-14T11:34:02+00:00" title="August 14, 2010 11:34AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting concept and question, Matthijs!

In film, getting the audience's skin to crawl or jump in fright is dependent on them projecting themselves into the situation on a visceral level.

Most prose literature does this, by leaving a lot of description general, so readers fills in details based on what the deft, terse imagery conjures up for them. It's a clunky and amateurish novel that spends a page and a half describing a main character from top to to, with hairstyle, facial features, height, weight, body parts, elaborate outfit, etc.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>Actually, I think Lost had a similar goal - the characters are lost, the audience is lost.</blockquote>\nGood call!<br><br>Peace,<br>-Joel                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286329/#Comment_286329" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-14T13:12:57+00:00" title="August 14, 2010  1:12PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Scott McCloud talks about the reason illustrators abstract their characters. The idea he presents in Understanding Comics is that the more abstract the character (Charlie Brown) the more the reader will project himself into the blanks spaces left by the abstraction, where more realistically rendered characters are more likely to be seen as separate people. Also, in video games the way the main character is often "voiceless," I think its a tool to make the players feel like there saying what needs to be said, instead of the character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286342/#Comment_286342" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-14T16:31:05+00:00" title="August 14, 2010  4:31PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 15, 2010 12:58PM by Nathan_H.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Psycho's shower scene, and the closet scene in Blue Velvet.  <br/>Both are pretty claustrophobic scenes.<br/>When the camera isn't on the main character, but becomes a character. <br/>I'm sure it has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_view_shot" rel="nofollow">name</a>?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anders%20Nygaard" title="Anders Nygaard"><img alt="Anders Nygaard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/404/nXX62OQ3D3YOT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anders%20Nygaard">Anders Nygaard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286393/#Comment_286393" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-15T05:47:44+00:00" title="August 15, 2010  5:47AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So emotions represented or inferred in the narrative of a character bleeds over into reality, into participants - players, actors or audience.

Their project, at the time, was to write short stories that push the boundaries of perspective. As far as I recall, the story went something like this:<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a white, wooden house in the centre of a huge field. On the porch of the house, an old farmer sits on a creaky rocking chair reading a thin story book. It is a story book about a young man on his way home after a terrible war. The young man in the story is on a ship, on deck, sailing into port. He is looking at a photo of his lover, a slim girl with a slim nose, a crooked chin and a lazy smile. He smiles back at the photo of his lover, missing her. He hopes she will be waiting for him at the port.<br/>\nTo his disappointment, the young man does not find the girl waiting for him. In fact, he does not find her anywhere. He looks all over town, enquires in Mackey's Bar, where they used to dance together after she finished work, enquires at the hotel, where they once pretended to be man and wife, enquires at the market, where she sold nuts and candies during the afternoons. No sign.<br/>\nThe story, of course, gets worse. Not only does the young man find that she has disappeared, but that she has betrayed him. She slunk off with his old drinking buddy, a rough faced old farmer from Kerry, and got herself pregnant. The young man gets angry, insane with righteous jealousy and goes to seek her out. He has a knife with him. Now he arrives at the farm and creeps through the huge field. He sees his girl through the window of the white house, preparing dinner. Now he creeps around the front of the house. There is someone there. He stays quiet and watches. On the porch of the house, an old man sits on a creaky rocking chair reading a thin story book. The old man stops reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, so that's a terrible rendition of an old memory of a vague story, but you get the idea. Perspective, the idea of changing the voice and position of the narrator, and the toying of it, might be the literary translation of this thread's 'bleed.'                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
