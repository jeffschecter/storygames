It's also easy just to miss a social cue, handing spotlight to the wrong player or taking it at the wrong time. That's just group-to-group stuff and it falls outside the bounds of game design.<br/><br/>What about when the rules basically tell you to?<br/><br/>Player Example: A lot of high-level D&amp;D magic circa 3.x can trivialize encounters that would otherwise engage the whole group, and it's frequently going to be the smartest, most plausible thing for a character to do. The Wizard can sweep the field clean according to the rules and in-game logic, and has to make a conscious decision not to play with the coolest stuff in their grimoire to keep stuff exciting.<br/><br/>GMing Example: Fielding an Angel smarter than a dog in Adeptus Evangelion. If it's built strong enough to challenge the party, there's nothing keeping it from going for headshots against the PCs and taking them out of the fight one by one except the GM playing both dumb and nice (This one actually goes for a lot of tactical/trad games).<br/><br/>Aversion Example: Playing Snaps out-of-time in Don't Rest Your Head. Sometimes the dice say 'Snap' at a bad time pacingwise, and there's an explicit pressure-release valve for this possibility: instead, set it aside, and handle the inevitably-messy details at a better time. The alternative would be doing like a Wizard might be expected to with their whammy spells, and hoarding your pretty, tempting Madness Dice even if it's absolutely time to throw them.<br/><br/>What are more rules or circumstances-from-rules where the optimal-or-requisite move is a bad one for fun?<br/>What are more rules that mitigate it, intentionally or otherwise?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434627/#Comment_434627" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-30T15:07:15+00:00" title="June 30, 2014  3:07PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, in one sense, can't any RPG that features randomness be said to have rules mandated fun killers if the dice go against what the players were "expecting" to happen?<br/><br/>There certainly are rule sets that are inappropriate for the way a particular group wants to have fun. But given that you know the possibilities presented by the rule set, shouldn't you be planning on having fun with the game in all it's glory?<br/><br/>I have certainly complained about "unfun" games in my time, but having been playing an OD&amp;D play by post game for several years (and recently starting to run my own), I've been experimenting with the idea that the game as presented can be fun, even when your character dies in the first few rounds of combat. The game might not be fun for everyone, but that's ok.<br/><br/>And yea, I haven't played a D&amp;D 3.x game for a while because of some of the high level "unfun" aspects. On the other hand, if I ever do decide to play again, I will look at how to engage the game on it's face.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
