My first inclination is to run a series of Indie games which don't neccessarily get a lot of shelf space or publicity. May gamers may not have heard of the likes of "Don't Rest Your Head", "Spirit of the Century", "Little Fears", "Dogs in the Vineyard" or Shock", and might appreciate a chance to see them.<br/><br/>Another part of me is tempted to run the big name games that people can immediately pick up off the shelf. Things like Exalted, D&amp;D or nWoD - where I'm sure the shop will have atleast the core rules in stock. That way I'm boosting the shops immediate sales and hopefully demoing games people have heard of and are curious about.<br/><br/>I've got experience of running games at cons, but what can I expect of store games? Do people generally stay through games, or can I expect people to drop in and out? If so I'm going to have to figure out some sort of game that isn't dependent on people remembering the entire session - since they may not have been there from the beginning.<br/><br/>Some things are obvious. As a store demo game it needs to be visual. Colourful character sheets  with more space dedicated to character pic and description than stats, colourful handouts preferably laminated that I don't mind loosing, simple rules summaries and lots of dice (which again I need to be prepared to loose) - that sort of thing. What I need to know is what works at a Store Demo game, and what should I look out for?<br/><br/>Finally what size of game works best as a demo game? I'm tempted to make it small (maybe 4 players) so I can give eah dedicated time - but at the same time going large lets more people try it out.<br/><br/>Thanks in advance for any suggestions.<br/>R00kie                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138481/#Comment_138481" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-07T04:59:45+00:00" title="April  7, 2008  4:59AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a <a>similar thread</a>.<br/><br/>My suggestion, barring other constraints, would be to run a game you really, really love, because you'll communicate that enthusiasm.  <br/><br/>When I think "demo", thanks to working the Forge booth at Gen Con, I think "15 minutes" - it sounds like you are thinking of a more traditional session - true?  It makes a big difference.  If you're churning through very short demos, people can watch and then play the next go 'round.  <br/><br/>Many small press, tightly focused games demo very well in a short amount of time.  You can show somebody why <i>Dogs </i>is so compelling in fifteen minutes, and if you have two hours, you can show them the whole deal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/R00kie" title="R00kie"><img alt="R00kie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/R00kie">R00kie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138508/#Comment_138508" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-07T07:49:27+00:00" title="April  7, 2008  7:49AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I checked out the thread you linked to and discovered Fred's great 15 minute scenarios for DRYH and SotC.

Cause that love will ooze onto the table, and...well you get what I mean.<br/><br/>I've ran a fair number of demo sessions at my FLGS, and they just happened to all be 2-4 hour one-shot sessions.  So you might want to ask your store what their expectations are.  I never used handouts myself.  I just showed up with the game and some notebook paper for making characters.  But if you are trying to "sell" a particular game, you might see if there are some demo materials for that game online.  <br/><br/>I happen to love running demo games that have some creative collaboration at the beginning.  It surprises the folks who are used to playing "The GM's game" and tends to get the table jazzed up!  Even if it's a game where you need to bring pre-gen characters, perhaps leave a thing or two blank for them to fill in at the table.  Or have a short conversation where you let them talk about how their characters know each other (or are in conflict with one another).<br/><br/>In my experience, the people who showed up on time got into the game, and they are tended to stay the entire session. If someone came late, I just looked around the table to see if it was an easy sell to slip them in (1001 Nights is a great one for that).  If not, I invited them to have a seat and watch the fun.  If someone has to leave early, it's no big deal.  Now you've got an extra NPC to run.<br/><br/>It's not going to have that same pressure (if that's the right word) or expectation of running a game at a busy con.  So just relax and have fun with it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138548/#Comment_138548" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-07T10:10:10+00:00" title="April  7, 2008 10:10AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I participate in a 'Small Press RPG Night' at the FLGS that is similar to running demos in that participation is open to whomever shows up.  We generally play one-shots but we've done longer arcs as well.  Our turnover in players has been high--both from game to game and within a story arc.  For some games--particularly Burning Wheel, Burning Empires--we've tried to have 'standby characters' available if new people show up.  Usually most players want to create their own character so they'll play the standby character for one game and then make a character for future games.<br/>It's a great feeling when someone watches a game or plays a 'standby' and then comes back the next week!<br/>We are able to use a big bucket o'dice provided by the store, so losing dice hasn't been a problem.  It's funny how everyone knows their own dice.  <br/>I don't normally use handouts other than those typical for the game--character sheet, the SOTC bookmarks, the Burning Wheel player aids...but I see the potential benefit of attractive player aids in attracting players.  <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138604/#Comment_138604" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-07T16:36:47+00:00" title="April  7, 2008  4:36PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>When I think "demo", thanks to working the Forge booth at Gen Con, I think "15 minutes" - it sounds like you are thinking of a more traditional session - true?

So, if you are considering the Con Demo format, check with the FLGS to see if they're cool (they could very well want people to be hanging out for 4 hours, or maybe they'll be jazzed about the idea of you being able to do up to four demos an hour).<br/><br/>I'll echo run what you love in a format that you're happy with. If its 8 players in 4 hours or 2 players in 15 minutes, or whatever.  LImit the player size to what works for the game and what you're comfortable with.  And if you really love indie games, talk to the FLGS into stocking some of them.  It's pretty easy, especially through IPR.  If you're going to run Don't Rest Your Head, and they have a handful of copies, they just might sell out the same day (especially if you are doing 15 minute demos for an extended time).  Is the game store's intention to sell more games or to get more people into the store and raise awareness and make it a cool place to hang out?  If the latter, they might not care if your running something that's obscure and out of print as long as people are having fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
