I'm not talking about open sandboxes \xe1 l\xe1 Judge Guildes, I'm talking about The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh or Queen of Spiders for example.<br/><br/>1. Theoretically speaking, is it possible to run their content with a Story Game system without breaking one or the other? If yes, how would you do that? What are the possible dangers and pitfalls?<br/><br/>2. Also a subquestion about railroadish modules. Do you know any game which help you to run them? Which can give the players fun but help you to elegantly maintain the prewritten plotline? There is an infamous MAGUS module for extremely high level characters. The story is very grandiose and plotted. I've always wanted to give it a try but never know how.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist" title="Antisinecurist"><img alt="Antisinecurist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist">Antisinecurist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448033/#Comment_448033" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-18T19:58:32+00:00" title="August 18, 2015  7:58PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It depends... do you want just the "feel" or "story" of it (IE atmospherics etc)?

I'm not familiar with the modules in question, but most of the old stuff that I remember was basically a flimsy setup for a whole bunch of fights/dungeon exploration/traps.   That... doesn't really lend itself particularly to storygames, because there's not really much to connect to there.  I mean, you could run it in Dungeon World or something, but I think it would end up being fundamentally unsatisfying.<br/><br/>If on the other hand, you've got something that has a sort of railroady story behind it (because we've sortof ruled out sandboxes, so I'm not sure what other kinds of modules we could be talking about here) then you might be able to do something with it depending on how attached you are to staying on track but I don't think a lot of storygames lend themselves super well to that.  You'd probably want to go the participationist route and sit down with your players and say "Look; I want to run this module.  It's super railroady.  Can you guys play along? It should be fun, but there really isn't much of anything off the tracks."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448037/#Comment_448037" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-18T20:44:45+00:00" title="August 18, 2015  8:44PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are a few basic go-to solutions depending on what you're looking to do, exactly.<br/><br/><i>Elfs</i> is a classical answer to this very question from Ron Edwards, a humorous game in which the PCs are elves (as in, Christmas elves or garden gnomes) with lusty, greedy and stupid personalities. They stumble, cheat, steal, fuck and murder their way through old school D&amp;D adventure modules, which are handled with a focus on character roleplaying of any particular denizens of the dungeon (so you try to get some interesting dialogue out of the monsters, rather than just see if they can kill the PCs), and the amusing ways the elves can get into danger in these dangerous environments.<br/><br/><i>Dungeon World</i> is an obvious tool for doing this sort of thing, too. Others are more qualified to comment on that, I'm sure.<br/><br/>There are also lightweight D&amp;D variants you could use to run old school or middle school D&amp;D easily enough; there's no reason why you would have to make it difficult for yourself to play these modules. Just grab something sleek and streamlined, and do it. <i>Deeds &amp; Doers</i> comes to mind as something perfectly usable and modern, at least as long as what you have is an old school adventure without significant railroading elements.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if you want to have some meat to the game and an interesting perspective on how to run the occasionally relatively railroadish middle school material, grab <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product/137719/Dragon-Union--an-addendum-for-the-fantasy-roleplaying-game?" rel="nofollow">Dragonpact</a> plus a Mentzer-like D&amp;D chassis - <i>LotFP</i> would serve, for example - and you'll have something pretty interesting in story gaming terms, yet still fully compatible procedurally with running these old modules.<br/><br/>Regarding a system that truly supports getting the bang out of the railroaded epics, to my knowledge there is no productized solution that I would recognize as such. This is obviously unfortunate, considering how very popular e.g. Pathfinder railroad epics are; I'm sure many people would be interested in some tools that'd make it easier to get the value out of this sort of stuff. Right now the best bet is to be an amazing GM of whatever ilk you're interested in being, unfortunately - stuff like the aforementioned Dragonpact helps, but it's not the entire solution yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448038/#Comment_448038" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-18T20:51:39+00:00" title="August 18, 2015  8:51PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 18, 2015 8:52PM by 2097.">edited August 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played in Dungeon World inspired by Stonehell.

I suppose I forgot about it altogether in this context because of the way it has everything hinge on the investigation story structure; the traditional fantasy adventure game railroad is more of a road trip + commando raid than an investigation. I think one could probably apply the Gumshoe precepts to some degree to something like that, but ultimately it doesn't do anything to help with the railroading in the parts where an adventure game actually needs it the most, such as when the party needs to decide to trust someone and do what they say, or when the party needs to succeed in combat or fail and get captured or whatever the script says.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448043/#Comment_448043" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-18T21:27:47+00:00" title="August 18, 2015  9:27PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 18, 2015 9:28PM by 2097.">edited August 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It does at least attempt to adress both issues.

Further south is ACKS land, or so I hear, but that's because my contacts there are American ex-pats rather than native Sk\xe5nebor.<br/><br/>It's also because this is a much smaller place... in the LotFP group I'm playing in, one guy made Eon (he's also into PbtA these days though, and is working on a Kult port) and one made Symbaroum (and posts on these boards!). I think there are like twenty people who are into RPGs in this whole land, and they all have their own groups that they jealously guard. And all these DMs get together once or twice a year and exchange notes and make games.

They can do whatever they like, but they only get XPs for doing stuff that's in the module. (Which you can telegraph to them very obviously, or not at all, or somewhere in-between, whatever seems like the most fun.)<br/><br/>Each time they do something that's described in the book, give them XPs.<br/><br/>This makes it pretty obvious that you're all on the same page, but still presents a fun "game" for the players to engage in. When they reach a crossroads, they can debate which way they are "supposed" to go according to the module, and then see if they got it right.<br/><br/>Optional:<br/><br/>If you want to put a fictional veneer on it, explain that the heroes are in the hands of Fate, and their actions fulfill an ancient prophecy. Each time they follow the tracks of the prophecy, they can sense a feeling a divine "righteousness" as they flow with the directions built into Fate itself, and they grow stronger and stronger.<br/><br/>(This possibly implies that the XP gain the players received is also somehow felt by the *characters*, as divine power or glowing eyes or just a sense that everything is falling into place.)<br/><br/>Give them whatever limited means to consult the "future", and then set them loose. For extra fun, you can include NPCs, spells, or other sources which allow them to ask about the future, like consulting a divine oracle.<br/><br/>If you're going for a nostalgia kick anyway, use the original rules (D&amp;D?) which were supposed to be used with the modules in the first place. If you're not, just use a game you like which seems to fit the fictional veneer of the modules (and ideally one where it's not TOO easy to die, unless you want dying and starting over to be an option).<br/><br/><br/>(On a fun note, I'd say most of the solutions suggested in this thread are pretty clearly Right to Dream-supporting, if we're still wondering if such a game can exist...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448073/#Comment_448073" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-19T20:21:46+00:00" title="August 19, 2015  8:21PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 19, 2015 9:52PM by 2097.">edited August 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, GNS is dead                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448075/#Comment_448075" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-19T20:57:25+00:00" title="August 19, 2015  8:57PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Haha!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448076/#Comment_448076" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-19T21:53:33+00:00" title="August 19, 2015  9:53PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (I am the cemetary gate that keeps CA in the ground.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448077/#Comment_448077" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-19T21:56:19+00:00" title="August 19, 2015  9:56PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The typical way many railroaders in the D&amp;D and Pathfinder world give out xp is to ignore xp but give out whole levels when the players reach the next chapter.

These systems are transparent enough that players can plan ahead.  (8 torches will give 16 turns of light, so they know when they have to start heading back to  the surface).<br/>- Helping rules get players involved in each other's actions.<br/>- Recovery tests allow for moments of character introspection in a challenge-based environment.<br/>-Support for a range of conflict types (Drive Off, Kill, Convince, Trick, Capture, Riddle, etc).<br/>- Lethality is largely driven by player choice (death is only on the line if the party chooses to engage in a kill conflict, so murdering every goblin you encounter is not a sound approach) and is generally well-foreshadowed (if a player presses on while injured or sick, the GM needs to tell them when a failed test could end in death).<br/>-  Characters change over time, gaining new traits and wises (area of expertise) based on their exploits.<br/><br/>Potential Pitfalls:<br/>- Torchbearer focuses on granular detail, each fight feels significant.  You need to remove most anonymous monsters off the map, keeping only plot-significant enemies.  Other monsters etc should only appear as the result of a twist (from a failed test).<br/>- System mastery is valued.
