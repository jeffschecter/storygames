By doing so you will steal energy from the game, as a black hole steals energy from space. <br/><br/><i>Partiality</i> is you coming out there, giving signals, opening up the field of play for the players to fill, to meet your energy with their own. It is you treating conflicts with obvious favoritism for one solution, showing fondness for one player, provoking action from the players, by being "not complete". By doing so you are using your sympathies to energize the game-play.<br/><br/>As a GM; being <i>neutral</i> is in fact both passive and destructive in role-playing games.

The neutral GM in play is (ideally) like a computer executing a programme - inputs are turned into outputs according to a precise formula. The GM is removed from the game, indistinct as a person (but very present as a force in play). I don't think you're "stealing" energy, you're redirecting, channeling. But yes, in play, you don't add, you just interpret.<br/><br/>But you're missing the most important part! The neutral GM does all their creative, inspired, passionate work away from the table. They <i>design</i> the programme they later execute. They put their energy in through the process of selecting or designing content for play, curating a ruleset, precisely imagining a fictional world. The neutral GM must be neutral at the table, but have a very powerful vision that they adhere to in how they design play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372805/#Comment_372805" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-14T03:19:39+00:00" title="April 14, 2012  3:19AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that this is a false dichotomy for most purposes, as the vast majority of games I've played require all players to exercise both restraint and commitment. Without restraint (neutrality) a GM will easily overpower and smother the input of the other players, obviating their choices. Without commitment (partiality) a GM will be unable to direct play in a constructive manner.<br/><br/>As a practical example, our D&amp;D campaign has a noticeably neutral GM in that I don't meddle in e.g. pacing and direction of play, both of which are very common GM duties. However, characterizing my stance as entirely neutral is a simplification: in truth I have to make creative choices that are constructive (partial) towards challengeful situations. As I often say, the only way for a D&amp;D sandbox to be both "realistic" and "challenging" is for the GM to constructively ignore certain realistic considerations in favour of providing content. Thus I execute some of my tasks in ways that are neutral in some regards, while other tasks are executed in ways that are partial in some way.<br/><br/>Even further, it is not quite fair to call a D&amp;D GM's refereeing duties "neutral" in the sense Tomas is suggesting above: the GM is not partial towards or against the players, that's true, and much has been said about that. However, at the same time the referee is definitely partial towards procedural purity and even-handed resolutions and locally developed rules tradition. I know that I'm myself very much invested in e.g. D&amp;D fight scenes - not because I care to influence who wins, but because I care to ensure that the proceedings are artful and the outcomes true to the system. In this way we can't even say that a single GM task is "neutral" or "partial" in nature: you are partial on some matters while being neutral in other ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_372809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372809/#Comment_372809" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-14T03:43:22+00:00" title="April 14, 2012  3:43AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like it when people are at an intellectual level where they will answer with sense, even though they may be provoked by the presentation of the issue at hand. :-)<br/><br/>No, I'm not missing out on anything. :-)<br/><br/>Let's be real; the ordinary GM will do very little design. She will adopt a method, given by a classical game, and most designers of classical games hold the ideal of GM-neutrality up high. So she will approach the table with the stance that she has to be neutral in refereeing the players and their characters. This will create an obstacle to her, as she will be prone to indetermination;<br/>- <i>determining</i> something (as in; choosing a consequence and go with it), is to be partial. So she will approach the table with a mind-set that makes her hesitate in crucial moments of game-play. Even though she will be able to overcome the hesitation, in most cases, this is no good!<br/><br/>As for the "precise formula" ...<br/>- there is no such thing in role-playing games. In classical rpgs the use of a GM makes certain no "formula" dominates the game. The GM is the dominant methodical factor in any classical role-playing game. What mind-set the GM approach the game with, is of utmost importance. Having a GM with a mind-set that is inclined to make her disconnected, indeterminate and not helpful, is no good.<br/><br/>And how does she fare in relation to "imagining a fictional world" with <i>precision</i>? <br/>- Oh, the neutral GM fares badly indeed! She is, in fact, advised to adopt a mind-set (the neutral referee) that seriously hinder the proactive precision of making a fictional world come alive. To make the world clash against the characters, she has to be able to subject them to the whims of a living world. There is no fairness or impartiality in real life. The world at large, and our petty lives, clash in multitudes of conflicts each and every day. And these conflicts are all made up of partial elements; the active elements of the world puts us to millions of tests with no sense of fairness. The single fact of where you are born, and to what parents, has made a lot of things hard for you, or impossible. To help players portray characters in a fictional world, with any vestige of realism (or; precision), the GM need to go at it with partial and skewed eyes, looking for ways to nudge conflicts towards this or that outcome, all the time. A true character is not meant to be a neutral entity; it is an entity which is partial to certain actions, partial to certain people, partial to certain emotions ... There is no neutrality in being a human being. The GM needs to help players into the character, and into the fictional world, by being partial too.<br/><br/>So, what am I talking about?<br/>- the importance of <i>being a good leader</i> (GM) in classical games, and how the ideal of neutrality is, in fact, destructive to good leadership in a game. A good leader needs to be proactive, partial and opinionated. A good leader will not let the reigns hang loose, but will use them to steer the carriage, with all who is aboard. A good leader gives direction.<br/><br/>The "neutral leader" does not exist in real life. Adopting a neutral <i>stance</i> will work in certain situations, to open up for  independent initiatives by subordinates, but as soon as such an initiative has be taken, you have to evaluate it as a responsible leader, and make up your mind on the nature of it; <br/>- how will it play out?<br/>- how can you interact with it?<br/>- and how can you put your opinion of it on the table? <br/>- what is the full ramifications of consequence?<br/>This is being biased and opinionated, not being neutral.<br/><br/>As <i>a principle of leadership</i> neutrality is nothing but relinquishing the responsibility you have taken on as a leader of a game. Be a responsible leader; be proactive, positive and partial!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_372810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372810/#Comment_372810" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-14T03:45:28+00:00" title="April 14, 2012  3:45AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Even further, it is not quite fair to call a D&amp;D GM's refereeing duties "neutral" in the sense Tomas is suggesting above</blockquote>D&amp;D?

This is such an instance. A lot of rpg-culture confuse neutrality with something it is not; <br/><i>- a positive stance that makes all of us enjoy the game.</i><br/><br/>It is, in fact, as you may read from the Oxford-definition of the word;<br/><i>- a negative stance that makes a lot of games go lame.</i><br/><br/>So we are better off by ridding ourselves of the misconception, as it stems from a shared anxiety for authorities. We are better off creeping out of the "safety" of relativism, into the landscape where decisions are made, principles are flaunted, and the virtues of truth, beauty and positive thinking are to be found. <br/><br/>There is no style in being neutral, only the misconception that;<br/><i>- I'm such a nobody everyone will be happy with me. </i>LOL<br/><br/>Eero; to exercise <i>restraint</i> is something we need to do, in all part of life, including role-playing games. That has little to do with neutrality, nor with the conforming <i>ideal of neutrality</i> in rpgs. Showing restraint is something we may do without being neutral in any way. You are loading a cherished word with more meaning than it actually can hold.<br/><br/>So, I maintain that as long as the popular <i>ideal of neutrality</i> persist in rpg-culture, the dichotomy is true; <br/>- we need to shred the popular veil of misconception surrounding the ideal of neutrality; is it loaded with negative elements, as indicated in the definition of neutrality<br/>- we need to adopt a more positive attitude towards leadership in games, and the definition of partiality points to some very interesting elements in that respect, elements that may explain the popular ideal of neutrality, and the true remedy to it when being a leader of role-playing games                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372814/#Comment_372814" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-14T04:49:44+00:00" title="April 14, 2012  4:49AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On the other hand, few people get their cues for how to think from dictionaries, so it's possible that the sort of neutral behavior some gaming styles advocate for the GM have nothing to do with the Oxford dictionary.<br/><br/>Regardless, I do agree with the substance of your point.

Being neutral or fair (which is not <span style="text-decoration: underline;">very</span> different) is far from what you need to work dangerous or insane themes into great game-play.<br/><br/>I'd like to say something of <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> in relation to this. It is a game designed to support drama of danger and insanity.<br/><br/>I love <i>Call of Cthulhu</i>, but it really is a game that is utterly dependent on the leader being able to support the danger and insanity of the theme. That is best done through the way you lead the group. A GM willing to invest in a style that mirrors the severity and impending chaos of the theme, the underlying tension, brings that extra something ot the table, the extra <i>oomph</i> needed for the game to lift. The genre of horror is unforgiving in this respect. If you fail to invite some "madness" into your style of leadership, or to be visibly invested in the happenings, the game will fall flat. <br/><br/>That is my experience with Call, and with other games of the horror genre. It mirrors my experience with any game that takes interaction a step further; into the realm of teeth-gnashing drama of any type. It is not done by detached GMs.<br/>- The GM is a <i>player</i>, at heart, and need to act up to fill his role of many mantles.<br/>- And the GM is a <i>leader</i>, at the end of the table, and need to accept his mantle of leadership to do it with grace and effectivity.<br/><i>Call of Cthulhu</i> is a true test of your ability to lead players in unfettered interaction of the type that does something more than simulate superfluous tactics. You need to be an engaged player to do it, and a strong leader. Being neutral or fair comes short.<br/><br/>That is the reason most ordinary GMs fail to make a game of Call good; they don't have the temerity to approach the game with anything but the ordinary neutral stance, or something akin to it. It is not any fault of them; they are dependent on the advice and tools they are given, and mostly those tools are insufficient. <br/><br/><i>Mind you; if you really want a game of superfluous tactics, find a neutral arbiter of a well designed conflict-system, and have fun.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372869/#Comment_372869" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-14T14:39:02+00:00" title="April 14, 2012  2:39PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>I can agree that saying insane stuff in a toneless voice would have an effect, but that is not neutral.</blockquote>\nJust out of curiosity, how many games do you think are played where the GM says everything (mundane stuff, insane stuff, whatever) in a toneless voice?

I think you're right in horror games it helps when the GM is partial. The universe is partial.<br/><br/>In a more heroic setting, that doesn't always make sense. Sometimes you still want that - so the players have fierce obstacles to overcome.<br/><br/>Other times you do not because the system ensures all obstacles are fierce, and instead a more objective and neutral stance is stronger.<br/><br/>Though, if we're going by these dictionary definitions, then I say neutrality isn't just bad, but impossible. Assuming a fairly typical, a classic, GM role, you can't be neutral and run a game. Nothing would happen because having anything happen would break the neutrality. Providing opposition favors the opposition, providing rewards favors the players.  The problem with the definition is that it assumes two opposing sides. That's true in the fiction, but in actuality everyone is on the same side to have fun, with some implicit level of challenge to accomplish that, depending on the game and social group. <br/><br/>So in the traditional sense the GM cannot be neutral to the point of inaction. But the GM can still be impartial. So that's the type of neutrality we're talking about, not a car unable to drive. Sticking to the die rolls. Sticking to levels of challenge and obstacles prescribed by the rules. Adjucating fairly without preference for players, without breaking the rules to achieve a desired result. Impartiality may even include ensuring that people are engaged and having fun. Just because everyone at the table wants that does not make that not-neutral! The GM's role is like a judge, but instead of justice, the objective is fun. And there's only the prosecution, the players, trying to get something done. Instead of a defense, there's the rules of the game.<br/><br/>Other games set up the rules to limit the GM. In these cases the GM is told to fight the players as hard as possible, and despite control over the setting and entire universe of the fiction, the rules limit what the GM can do. A simple example is: A rule that says the GM can only use a d8 for the opposition in the first scene. The GM is free to describe the sun exploding and the planet cracking, but still can only use that d8 and will look rather foolish if the players beat it.<br/><br/>So, yes. I agree that the dictionary definition of neutral, removed of all nuance of language and connotation is bad. But so is partial. Partial says unfair and biased and incomplete. That sounds like a terrible GM too. I've played with GMs like that and I can tell you it IS terrible. Worse than a GM who is too passive, I can assure you.<br/><br/>We are not dictionary definitions. Language is a tool to explain reality. It is not reality.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_373162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373162/#Comment_373162" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-16T22:01:44+00:00" title="April 16, 2012 10:01PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 16, 2012 10:28PM by TomasHVM.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your argument is very good, Jogesh, and it got me thinking once more on the idea I tried to communicate. So let me make a new effort to communicate it in a concise and positive manner ...<br/><br/>Originally this was a question of philosophy, rather than direct adherence to being neutral or partial. The dictionary offer a clue to how two philosophical stances may influence your game;<br/>- the philosophy of neutral is passive and un-energizing<br/>- the philosophy of partial is energizing and active<br/>When these two "philosophies" are transported to the realm of role-playing, there is no doubt about what I prefer; the energizing and active one. That is how I want to be as a GM.<br/><br/>But ...<br/>- there's an important question to be asked here; How is it that the elements of partiality, albeit negative in many respects, can be said to communicate such a positive philosophy? How come neutral is so close to apathy, and partial is so close to pro-active? I'll leave the answer in relation to neutrality to others, and focus on partiality.<br/><br/>Partiality is a word with lots of negative connotations in rpgs. Those connotations are highly understandable; no one wants to be a jerk; no one wants to have players walk out on them, furious and insulted. Being unfair and biased, showing favoritism towards one particular player easily turns you into such a jerk.<br/><br/>So; how can I prefer that one? Is it possible at all, to adopt partiality as a positive philosophical stance as a GM, so as to be strengthened by it, and so as it will work to strengthen your game?<br/><br/>Yes, I believe so. Let us have a look at each and every part of the definition of partial/partiality, not shying away from any "problematic" part of it ...<br/><br/>Translating the elements of the definition of partial/partiality into <br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">positive RPG-language</span>:<br/>- not complete, forming only part -&gt; framing scenes in an open way, inviting players to make a mark on the fiction<br/>- biased, unfair -&gt; working any dramatic situation with opinionated input, using elements that provoke the characters<br/>- having a liking for -&gt; showing how much you like some actions, cheering player input<br/>- bias, favoritism -&gt; favoring different players all the time, to help create tensions between characters<br/>- fondness -&gt; imbuing your game-play with enthusiasm, showing a positive attitude towards the act of playing<br/><br/>You see? Translated like this, we end up being GMs that work the field of play with unstinting positive attitudes, being active and enthusiastic, imbuing the drama with positive tension. Such a GM will go a long way in helping the players to take the same positive stance. Having a group act in accordance with such principles is PURE GOLD in a role-playing game.<br/><br/><i>I must admit that I have had a great deal of trouble concretizing this.

When I can provoke and frame and put energy into the game, without concern over playing favorites, just go with the emotional flow -- that is an excellent game that I enjoy. I use "energy" instead of enthusiasm, but I think the intention is the same. The energy is of course not directed antagonistic towards any <i>players</i>, but part of it can certainly be joking, moking, and feigned anger or threats. An example is taunting a player to have her character go down into the dark basement. Making it clear that this taunting is playful, going down into the basement is a bad idea for the character, but it's an excellent idea for the player and all of us involved.<br/><br/>I still think there may be value in neutrality, but I cannot think of examples in games that I still enjoy to play and run today. I can imagine hypothetical games similar to some I do like that are strongly reliant upon player vs player conflicts. In such a game, I could see the GM role being a strong and fierce neutrality, mapping neutrality in similar positively focused ways as you did with partiality. I also think it is a potentially strong choice for some types of players with preferences different than mine, particularly where the setting and universe benefits from a picture of cold logic and uncaring rationality. In a sense, neutrality can still bring great tension. Instead of coming from the GM, then tension comes from the system and the knowledge that the GM is not going to pull punches. There is nothing stopping from the GM bringing enthusiasm. Just as one could say the universe is enthusiastic about creation. But the universe created flowers and deadly viruses with equal enthusiasm. Explore the dungeon or climb the wall, but a bad roll can spell doom, and the GM isn't going to play favorites and ensure your character survives.<br/><br/>There is something to be said for that style.  Though I agree that the GOLD is found in the former. That's the style of game I enjoy to run more. When I'm playing, I sometimes enjoy the latter, but not too often.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373671/#Comment_373671" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-19T13:19:37+00:00" title="April 19, 2012  1:19PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>We are talking about how a "GM" (this special player in classical rpgs) may work to impact the interaction in benevolent ways, aiming for excellence.
