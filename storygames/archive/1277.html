                    (I know that I'm not the best qualified to start this discussion, but I'm having a bad day so need something else to work on and this struck me as a good idea)
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: iago</cite>What I want to see is a merging of the character concept stuff with the story skeleton my author-friend Jim Butcher espouses here:<br/><br/><a href="http://jimbutcher.livejournal.com/1308.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://jimbutcher.livejournal.com/1308.html</a></blockquote>
<blockquote><cite>from the avobe link:</cite>The story skeleton (also called a story question) consists of a simple format:<br/><br/>*WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS*, *YOUR PROTAGONIST* *PURSUES A GOAL*. But will he succeed when *ANTAGONIST PROVIDES OPPOSITION*?<br/></blockquote>
and the one sentence character concept is:

First we should look closely at the story skeleton:<br/><br/>*WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS* - this seems like a bang (â€œthe Technique of introducing events into the game which make a thematically-significant or at least evocative choice necessary for a playerâ€) to me.  The player should not be able to ignore the SOMETHING.<br/><br/>*YOUR PROTAGONIST* - obviously in most roleplaying games, this means player character.  Interestingly, this could mean a group of characters or just one.  In traditional play, there was a group so the SOMETHING HAPPENING had to be something that at least a socially contracted majority was interested in, with treats of boredom for those who didnâ€™t â€œgo along the plotâ€, making the game feel railroaded.<br/><br/>*PURSUES A GOAL* - another point of contention for railroading.  What if your protagonist reacts to the SOMETHING in a way that the GM didnâ€™t foresee?  If you didnâ€™t pursue the GOAL that she had set up, then all of the OPPOSITION that she had planned goes down the tube and there is no game (obviously Iâ€™m giving a worst case here).  Also, this GOAL is different than the (personal goal) in the one sentence character concept.  This is a reaction to the SOMETHING, while the (personal goal) is part of the character.<br/><br/>*ANTAGONIST PROVIDES OPPOSITION* - situation in a nutshell (situation defined as â€œdynamic interaction between specific characters and small-scale setting elementsâ€).  The ANTAGONISTS are the small-scale setting elements and the PROVIDING OPPOSITION is the dynamic interaction.  Sure there are small-scale setting elements that arenâ€™t antagonistic, but without some scale of antagonism, there arenâ€™t any dynamic interactions (I swear that that sentence made sense when I wrote it).<br/><br/>So there you have it, years of reading the Forge condensed into two simple (but not easy) sentences.<br/><br/>Now lets look at the one sentence character concept (out of order this time):<br/><br/>(profession) â€“ A lot is rolled up in profession.  Skill sets, contacts, and socioeconomic data can all be implied by the profession.  A few games like my (PIMP) work in progress Blazon or Dogs in the Vineyard, have all of the characters basically follow the same profession.  In these cases, a different layer of characterization should be used.<br/><br/>(personality trait) - All characters need personality, Itâ€™s interesting to note that two layers of characterization are popular (see Pace and Trollbabe and Almost Everything That White Wolf Ever Put Out).  One sets up the character image (in this case the profession) and one distinguishes the individual.<br/><br/>(personal goal) â€“ This is a separate goal from the GOAL above; this is a part of the character.  Synchronically, I was awake at 4:30 this morning think about how characters could be defined by their goals, both large and small.  In many ways similar to a Kicker, when the (personal goal) is achieved, the character needs to be rewritten or dropped since she is no longer the same character.  But also a mechanism needs to be in place for goals to change (like TsoYâ€™s Keys which is a perfect example of this).<br/><br/>OK, now that weâ€™ve analyzed it, itâ€™s time to pull everything together.  To save time, letâ€™s pull the examples from the two authors (note, small changes are made to the story skeleton example to fit a group of protagonists instead of just one):<br/><br/>A forlorn air pirate seeks the City of Gold.<br/>A vengeful princess engineers the downfall of the Empire.<br/>A nebbish superhero tries to get a date.<br/>But when a series of grisly supernatural murders tears through Chicago, they set out to find the killer. But will they succeed when they find themselves pitted against a dark wizard, a Warden of the White Council, a vicious gang war, and the Chicago Police Department?<br/><br/>Now, if that doesnâ€™t sound like a rocking story then I donâ€™t know what does.  But does that work out as a roleplaying game?  In a way, it looks just like the â€œCreating Situationâ€ post from <a href="http://lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=183" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=183</a> .<br/><br/>The point above about railroading should be looked at.  First, why are an air pirate, a princess, and a superhero working together?  Why do they care about a series of grisly supernatural murders that tears through Chicago?  And how do we know that they are going to set out to find the killer so we can set up a dark wizard, a Warden of the White Council, a vicious gang war, and the Chicago Police Department to be pitted against?<br/><br/>(to be continued)                </div>

Over the years, these are some of the problems that better designers than I have tried to fix.  Group creation (â€œoh, how about your princess knows where a map to the City of Gold is, that way we work togetherâ€) or strong starting premises (â€œok, a series of grisly supernatural murders are going to be tearing through Chicago.  You play the princess, you play the air pirate, and Iâ€™ll take the superhero.â€ Um, that example doesnâ€™t work as well with these characters, does it?) can help with the first.  Flags (in the form of the personal goals like â€œone of the grisly dead was a girl that said â€˜yesâ€™ to a date, now I must find her killerâ€) and reward systems can help with the second.  Conflict webs and relationship maps create a cast of starting antagonists that are going to try to grab the protagonists and get the protagonists to pursue their story goals and, by reacting and acting, the protagonists will define their own story goals.<br/>
<br/>
Now, that is my overanalysis.  How would you combine these two thoughts?                        </div>

                            Tony, I'm not ready to concede that point. I guess it depends on what you mean by personality. Ex:<br/><br/>A silver-tongued police officer is looking for the men who killed his only love. <br/><br/>is more interesting than a vengeful police officer. Goes without saying (because of what you've said) that he's vengeful. What makes this character different from every other vengeful cop is that this one is silver-tongued. Or delusional. Or cold and emotionless. Or whatever. <br/><br/>"A vengeful princess tries to get a date" is actually more of a character to me (because theres more 'stubs' to fill in) than "A romantically-starved princess tries to get a date". <br/><br/>Clearly you'll be able to throw back counterexamples that just plain Won't Work. But, while we're talking about quick descriptions that give a lot to work with, I think giving a (granted: workable) personality trait distinct from the conflict can be very useful.                        </div>

                            I think there's a lot to be gained <i>in the process</i> of finding out why the silver-tongued police officer is uniquely driven (because of that slick nature) to respond to the death of his lover.

Not to speak for Tony but:<br/><br/>"A vengeful princess tries to get a date" is the more interesting character because we've said two very different things about her.  First she's vengeful, secondly, <strong>she cannot ignore</strong> the opportunity of a date.  If you substitute "love-lorn" for "vengeful," your just providing depth on one thing: that this chick needs a date.  <br/><br/>It's like if we're playing a more traditional game, and I have a situation in mind, I might say "I need you to make characters who would X" (The example I'm thinking of is "join a sort of foreign legion of criminals and mystic rejects."  2 points if you can guess the system.)  Which is sort of working backwards along the same line.                        </div>

Totally, totally couldn't agree more. But if you're using this process for character creation, don't you want exactly that? "A lot to be gained in the process of finding out" is _exactly_ what I'd want when using this for character generation. Or, for that matter, elevator pitching a story - you want the listener to be considering the <b>intersection</b> of that personality and the goal/conflict/situation. <br/><br/>So, maybe we totally agree and I just read your first post wrong.                        </div>

                            Judson, Dave, I think you're breezing right past Tony's Basic Edition point and rushing onwards to the Advanced Edition special rules.  If the princess is trying to get a date, then <em>of course</em> there's some reason that she needs or wants to get that date.  That's what Tony's saying.  That the princess-who-needs-a-date also has a personality trait of fill-in-the-blank provides fodder for exploration, but that comes second to the fact that the princess needs that date.  The extra stuff is gravy.<br/><br/>The reason why this is important is that tons and tons of folks have missed the first step -- that the princess needs a date -- and want to jump right into the dating game with a sharp-tongued / vengeful / whatever princess <em>who doesn't need the date that the game is about</em>.  Which is the short road straight into dissonance and unsatisfying play.  The impulse to make the character "interesting" must work on top of a foundation of the character being <em>relevant</em>.  Otherwise, the character isn't ever going to be interesting.                        </div>

You read it right, it just wasn't a very completely thought out idea.<br/><br/>I <b>think</b> that this distinction connects with the distinction between top-down creation of story ("We're going to be telling a story about how Blaze addresses the questions of balancing her career as a superhero with her role as a mother.  Now let's play the game, using that known structure to inform and guide our choices") and bottom-up creation of story ("Here's Blaze!  She's got issues.  Let's find out what issues are important, and why, through the process of play.  And if we don't find anything that makes sense ... oh well!")<br/><br/>You think?                        </div>

Interesting.  I'll take it a step farther and say "Opponent supplies adversity" either need the same "profession" or the same "personality" as the protagonist, but never both.  The Vengeful Princess should face either a Happy With the New Empire Princess or Vengeful Peasant (to invoke Hermann Hesse "If you hate a person, you hate something in him that is part of yourself. What isn't part of ourselves doesn't disturb us.").<br/><br/>Could character, not just situation, be described with the story skeleton?<br/><br/><b>When the Empire conquers her kingdom, a vengeful princess engineers the downfall of the Empire.  But will she succeed when pitted against an equally vengeful peasant and a happy with the new empire princess?</b><br/><br/>*WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS* then becomes the kicker.  *ANTAGONIST PROVIDES OPPOSITION* becomes more personal.<br/><br/>What is the different from character and situation?  Can you have a character without situation?  Can you have a character without setting?
<blockquote><br/>Note how naturally it <b>doesn't</b> work when you desynchronize these things:<br/><br/>A vengeful princess tries to get a date<br/>A nebbish superhero engineers the downfall of the Empire.<br/><br/>Yes, you could make<i>terrific</i>stories that would be described by either of these, but it would be because you looked past the surface that you're describing to find the underpinnings that correlate (the vengeful princess is also a teenager ... so her getting a date is fit adversity ... and she's doing it to show her annoying older brother that he's not the only one who's growing up, so her vengeance makes it impossible for her to dodge the problem).</blockquote>
When personality and goal are "desynchronized" one or the other isnâ€™t the best way to describe the character.<br/><br/><b>A vengeful princess tries to get a date</b> isn't the character as you point out, the character is more likely <b>A vengeful princess tries to get a date <i>to spite her brother</i></b>.  The date is a short-term goal and can be reduced from the character and the character simplified to <b>A vengeful princess tries <i>to spite her brother</i></b>.  Basic character algebra.<br/><br/>Which is what I was thinking about at 4:30 this morning: how much of a fictional character can be defined as goal?  Goals define or are defined by their personality.  Skills are learned to pursue goals.  But it lead to a circle and a headache in the predawn hours.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: judson</cite><br/>"A vengeful princess tries to get a date" is the more interesting character because we've said two very different things about her.  First she's vengeful, secondly,<strong>she cannot ignore</strong> the opportunity of a date.  If you substitute "love-lorn" for "vengeful," your just providing depth on one thing: that this chick needs a date.</blockquote>
Again interesting.<br/><br/>At first I thought that the personality was a modifier of the basic character type (here the profession).  But now it seems as if the personality and goal are related.  But that creates one-dimensional characters.  Your point about how a vengeful dating princess is a more interesting character is great.  But if we use my made up basic character algebra, can we not then draw a personality trait or a goal from the other side.<br/><br/>The poor vengeful, dating princess now has two personalities and two goals: for example <b>A vengeful, yet nebbish princess tries to spite her brother while at the same time get a date</b>.  Now she has two conflicts in her life, and she is indeed more interesting.  The dating isn't just part of her plan for vengeance, it's a conflict goal.  Each scene she must decide whither she wants to work on vengeance or a date, trying to find a way to balance both.                        </div>

Your "character algebra" is an interesting way of framing a concept I've intuited for some time now.  That you're raising it suggests that it's worth developing more explicitly.<br/><br/>Specifically, a lot of the situation building that goes back and forth across a table amounts to constructing some kind of "character equation" and handing it back and forth until we don't have any variables left.<br/><br/>Specific examples: <br/><br/>In TSoY, I make a character with a Key of Unrequited Love.  That's essentially a personality trait, with a connection to another character.  I push my sheet across to the GM, who now has to work that Key into his situation.  He is essentially solving for the goal (ish.)<br/><br/>On the other hand, if I start out an Unknown Armies game with "We're playing a group of New Inquisition goons" I'm presenting a restriction on goal, which you'll then need to solve for a personality to match.<br/><br/>I don't know if I like this better or worse than the 5 W's game, primarily because I find myself doing it fairly naturally anyway, and I think (to keep with the math metaphor) the range of both processes is a proper subset of the universe of possible characters and situations.  If you need it though, probably best to know both tools.                        </div>

For Blazon, I want players to draw the coat of arms for their knights.  Then they show them to the other players and the other players come up with a list of three or four attributes or traits about that character from the coat of arms ("the red lion seem very brave to me").  After this discussion, I think I'm going to add another step, one where the player takes that list, chooses two of the traits, and then writes goals relating to those traits.<br/><br/>Game play should be a cycle of cause and effect after that.  Something happens -&gt; protagonists pursue goal -&gt; antagonists oppose goal by making -&gt; something happen.  Antagonists themselves will mirror a personality trait, but have a very different goal.<br/><br/>For character development, the goals can and will change, but if the personality changes, the goal must be re-evaluated.  A forlorn air pirate might find the City of Gold empty and instead seek out his long lost father, but if he becomes a vengeful air pilot then his seeking of the City of Gold is now out of spite and the spite itself becomes the goal.<br/><br/>characters + setting = situation<br/>character goal + antagonist goal = conflict<br/><br/>there seems to be a one to many relationship between personality and goal (the forlorn air pirate can seek the City of Gold or his lost father).  So:<br/><br/>goal + x = personality<br/><br/>Does x equal backstory/kicker?  That seems to imply that goal comes before personality.  But the equation still works if we treat the backstory/kicker as negative (which to be honest most characters would think it was) so:<br/><br/>personality - kicker = goal<br/><br/>If<br/>character = personality<br/>kick = situation<br/><br/>then:<br/>character - (character + setting) = goal<br/>goal = -setting<br/><br/>The goal of any character is to destroy the setting!  Those bastards!  Or backwards<br/><br/>setting = -goal<br/><br/>The only setting that matters to the situation is that which opposes the character's goal.                        </div>
