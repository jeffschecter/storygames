I guess the question speaks to a certain type of game. We can talk about D&amp;D if you like, because its a nearly universal training ground for gamers and because with the whole OSR thing and D&amp;D Next its kind of been on my mind lately. All of the games you mention (except maybe Savage Worlds, never really looked into it) have a certain amount of technique built in, but very little about D&amp;D or games in the same vein tell you how to make the game work in terms of keeping it engaging from moment to moment. The White Wolf games did a better job at this, but the way their advice was presented was too opaque to me (at the time) to be usable.<br/><br/>Thinking of breaking out a game like Legend of the Flame Princess or Dungeon World and listening to actual play recordings, I'm struck by how flat the interactions at the table are.

I have a super-spare descriptive style, very minimal that requires players to ask questions if they want details (and, maybe informed by story-game things I have a tendency to reply "I don't know, you tell me" or "ask the cleric" whenever I do get asked anything that's not immediately obvious). But somehow I have the players telling me specifically afterwards about things that they find terribly exciting or evocative\u2014often surprising me at the end of the night with specific accolades. It doesn't take very many words, and sometimes that flatness can actually be emerging because of dramatic tension or game difficulty that the players feel\u2014like a poker face in a sense. They are trying to sneak past the monsters.<br/><br/>I guess it works when the players are in it deep so that they automatically want to fill in those blanks. When I'm introducing new players I try to emphasize the most seductive things about the game that make them take on those descriptive responsibilities for themselves\u2014like buying equipment, or making them invent answers to unexpected dumb questions when they are introducing a new character (in the style of Tim the Enchanter). I describe this process as tricking people into playing because it starts with some innocuous die rolls, and once I've got them shopping for equipment I figure they are stuck with it\u2014especially when I tell them that they have to now come up with an awesome name and then they are ready. Because that is the step where they start to imagine things with very little prompting: "What's the difference between dry rations and trail rations? One is more expensive...".<br/><br/>We do get big breaks: when things go really bad but the group manages to pull out the whole bar ends up looking at us because suddenly everyone is standing up and cheering about someone rolling a saving throw when a moment ago they were almost silent.<br/><br/>Anyway it's probably partly for this reason that although I'm super interested in reading about game design or OSR ideas or whatever I find play recordings incredibly boring.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409856/#Comment_409856" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-21T00:29:31+00:00" title="March 21, 2013 12:29AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Focus on what the players want.

I'm pretty sure you change your gaming style depending on the game that you hold in your hand.<br/><br/>In a best case scenario, I teach others the techniques by putting them in a structure. It can be as simple as just using a mantra - "If they can do it in an easy way, then they can do it in a hard way" - or answering a question in every situation - "How will they fail?". The structure could also be put into a procedural structure (ex. how to frame a scene) or a list of choices (ex.

So you're probably getting something that's 30%-40% as engaging, at most (no hard numbers, just my guess), as an in-play session.<br/><br/>You have to gear a recording specifically towards being a recording in order to get a lot of mileage out of it, and not just pop a recorder into the middle of a session.<br/><br/>EDIT: as a secondary thought, AP recordings are also terrible at recording the impact of game mechanics at the table. If you call out a die roll result, that slows it down, and it's still not as engaging as seeing the result rolled onto the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409921/#Comment_409921" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-21T09:30:43+00:00" title="March 21, 2013  9:30AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On the written advice level, I also recommend the Player and GM sections in <i>Other Worlds</i> for a well-framed, conversational distillation of effective prep and play techniques.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409984/#Comment_409984" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-21T16:15:31+00:00" title="March 21, 2013  4:15PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No impro can beat a good prep, for even with good prep you will need a ton of good impro.

Sleep well, eat just enough and healthy, read a lot and talk with people a lot: that's part of the prep too. <br/><br/>Houserule, hack or design the game from zero if you know you and/or your players won't feel comfortable playing it. Players will often have better ideas than you, don't be afraid to steal them and use it. <br/><br/>Let players build things, places, groups, tools, relationships: the things they make will be the ones they grow most attached to.

Yet IME, it's very rare for new characters to have significant "wants"; wants develop over the course of play, and as such are at least as much about what the GM puts in as what the players do.<br/><br/>naming everyone is good practice, but making players narrate before they roll is nearly the opposite of good practice IMO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410008/#Comment_410008" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-21T18:46:09+00:00" title="March 21, 2013  6:46PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            MB wasn't asking for 'Best Practice' though, they were asking what worked (or didn't) in low structure games (for me). All those techniques work wonderfully for me (far more than preparing every little scene in my pre-prepared storyline and having read aloud text boxes). <br/>I use all those techniques in various degrees whilst preparing and running DCCrpg, Moldvay, 4th Ed (essentials), Cthulhu Dark, *World games, WoDu, Lady Blackbird, The Wildlings, Burning Wheel (hub only for me), Mouseguard, Durance, Technoir.... <br/><br/>In regards to player wants, its vital in my idea of antagonism to know what they want out of t<b><i>this particular game</i></b>. It could be as simple as to 'fight things and roll lots of conflict resolution dice' as they flagged when choosing a fighter class for their character, or as detailed as 'discovering that I'm not just a simple farmboy, but the son of a god and my destiny is to overthrow a tyrannical regime...'. These wants may be quite disparate or amorphous across the group, so its vital that everyone is on the same page in regards to setting and the initial situation, and tie their characters (as a group chargen session ) into that in some way. Then you have the grist for the mill, you can give each character a chance to shine, highlighting their schtick and tapping into player wants simultaneously.<br/><br/>In regards to narrating prior to a roll, what we like to do is focusing on fiction rather than dice-rolling. Though obviously the results of the dice rolling generate fiction too... This highlights the whole 'What do you do?' 'What's your intent?' 'How do you do that?' sort of questioning to nail down the task/conflict/risk/intent/anticipated result prior to rolling the dice. It just helps me (and everyone at our table) visualise the drama, far more so than just announcing what (mechanical) action you are engaging and rolling dice to determine a mechanical result. This works for me, and I thank Vincent, Luke, all the Johns, Tony, Graham and everybody on this wonderful forum for helping me articulate these tools!

I'm only sceptical about the latter example you gave, almost a story arc; I find that sort of want very rare indeed, and I don't really know what to do with it, as it feels a bit like playing before you play.<br/><br/>As for narration, what you describe here seems more like discuss and explain before you roll, rather than narrate before you roll.  What I suggested is not simply reporting mechanical results, but narrating after the roll, so that the player, or perhaps GM, can bring those mechanical results to life in fictive terms.<br/><br/>Sometimes all this emphasis on intention and agenda and so on leaves me feeling that the actual presentational part of play gets forgotten, which seems rather dull and dry to me.  It think there's a big chunk of performative art that gets overlooked, and that is the point I was making in the context of a question about GM practices for low structure games.  We often seem to forget that the GM, on top of all that intentional stuff, is also an actor, a story-teller, a set designer, and a theatrical director.  A lot of what made low structure games viable in the days before the motivational elements were examined lay in those skills.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
