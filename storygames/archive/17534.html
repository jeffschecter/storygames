Masks of Nyarlathotep is, IMAO, a beautiful case of not railroading. /.../ But, the choke point I cringe at comes about not because of railroading but because /.../ there is only one way to do a very important thing,  /.../ Otherwise, well, I guess you don't find a huge chunk of plot and spend at least one full session, if not more, with no idea of what to do. </blockquote>\nI'm curious, but how can you have choke points while not railroading? Choke points exist IMHO because the players <i>need</i> to do something, and that seems typical for railroading to me.<br/><br/>Note: I have nothing against railroading per se. I think it can be an excellent GM technique, if you want to achieve certain feelings.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397619/#Comment_397619" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-15T13:34:06+00:00" title="November 15, 2012  1:34PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The "They have to make this roll / say this phrase / do this thing or the adventure is over." chokepoint is almost a general thing for adventure writers and GMs I think.

Something always misses the flow or the flavor of the story and falls by the wayside.<br/><br/>I can't imagine Fiasco being in any way "railroady" by any common use of the term. It's, like, the opposite of railroady. Unless one adopts muddy semantics and claims that the Tilt elements railroad the story... hell, in that case, any situation or event out of the express control of the players is "railroading," which is so loose of a meaning as to render the term useless for categorization.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397634/#Comment_397634" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-15T14:24:43+00:00" title="November 15, 2012  2:24PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also think "the module is over" may be burying the lede in my example, looking back at David's analysis in the previous thread. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397637/#Comment_397637" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-15T14:27:02+00:00" title="November 15, 2012  2:27PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was not saying Fiasco was railroady but that chokepoints can occure in it, if done wrong.

You can run a module in a larger campaign with plenty of other things happening (or even two modules happening at once).

It's kind of a bad thing, in the sense that most people like to be successful and a strong chokepoint can take that away from them with no room for appeals, alternate approaches, clever solutions, etc.. If you're playing with people who enjoy succeeding so much that they will make multiple attempts to succeed and/or come at difficult problems with as much cunning and lateral thinking as they can bring to bear on it, then you should really consider how you can make strong chokepoints flexible enough to accommodate that; sticking to your "no, you failed your Library Use, so you never figure this out, so you lose" guns is a bad call for that group. But if they don't care whether they win or lose, it's probably okay to let them lose because they boned one roll.<br/><br/>Railroading to me is when no matter what the players want to do, they always end up at the same place (which I think is often fine, as long as it's an interesting place and how they got there seems appropriate/plausible to the players), or they discover that everything else is always boring/uneventful/spiteful until they get back on the train and do as they're told. Choosing to go left or right on the road and always ending up at the goblin village is railroading, but not bad; it's a road, the choice was largely arbitrary, there isn't much to bitch about there. Choosing to turn around and go back home and finding that the bridges have all collapsed behind you and the rivers are suddenly swollen and also made of lava and teams of dragons are incinerating anything that tries to fly away because GOD DAMN IT you are going down the road to that goblin village OR ELSE? Bad.<br/><br/>So yeah, I think you can have chokepoints without railroading. Imagine a chokepoint like JDCorley's "gotta have The Mysterious Ring" example. As written, you have one and only one way to get that ring: make your Swamp Navigation check. But if the module just said "the PCs need The Mysterious Ring; it is in the Swamp Temple," that might change things. There might be lots of ways to find a Swamp Temple using other resources besides wading hip-deep in sludge, depending on the game and the PCs.

If you're playing with people who enjoy succeeding so much that they will make multiple attempts to succeed and/or come at difficult problems with as much cunning and lateral thinking as they can bring to bear on it, then you should really consider how you can make strong chokepoints flexible enough to accommodate that; sticking to your "no, you failed your Library Use, so you never figure this out, so you lose" guns is a bad call for that group.

If we're merely looking at a single scenario, then a chokepoint or railroading or whatever is measured against that module. If we're looking at a campaign, then things are completely different.<br/><br/>This actually is extremely important in actual play. Many of the adventure modules I've used in our D&amp;D sandbox have been somewhat linear in nature, involving chokepoints. This has not devolved into railroading in any meaningful sense, however, because the general structure of the sandbox campaign uplifts and supports us: players who find a given adventure too difficult or not rewarding enough or whatever have a viable, realistic ability to just walk away and consider this particular adventure lost. I emphasize viability here: it's not a theoretical fringe failure condition to declare that the characters retreat from this adventure, it's something that happens all the time and is a key strategic choice.<br/><br/>Few campaigns, however, have a full-blown sandbox backup for the adventure modules that are used. Are you really OK as a GM if the players decide 15 minutes into the adventure that they'd rather skip this one? Did you bring a backup? How much work do you lose as a sunk cost if the players discard this adventure? It seems to me that most prewritten adventure modules are used in a context where the module is at least tonight the only show available. Often it's also a show selected by the GM (as opposed to consensual negotiation as our D&amp;D campaign). These things matter, they're basically the difference between a railroad and a dynamic play experience.<br/><br/>To pick an example, Jim Raggi's adventures are often pretty chokepoint-heavy, at least compared to many other old school D&amp;D authors. However, these cruel adventures with only one way into the dungeon or inescapable death traps work really well with the kind of strategic backup our campaign provides. I can imagine how absolutely frustrating something like Death Frost Doom or Grinding Gear could be for a player if you didn't get to make the choice to enter the adventure yourself, if you didn't get to select your approach vector, if you didn't set your own victory conditions, and so on. However, with players involved in all these elements and more, the linear dungeon becomes just a cruel choice instead of a sadistic exercise in powerlessness.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397682/#Comment_397682" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-16T01:31:26+00:00" title="November 16, 2012  1:31AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>One of the best bits of basic GMing advice I've gotten (and given) over the years regarding chokepoints was to have at least one idea about how the PCs could get past it (two or three, even), but to not be so attached to those ideas that you won't be able to recognize a clever, workable solution just because you didn't think of it first.</blockquote>\nDoesn't quite make sense to me - are you doing it because it seems a workable solution, or are you doing it to remove the presumed choke point?

You gave me the impression in the other thread that you sometimes defined scenarios like non-railroads when there still were (in my mind), and here you are, giving really good answers to my original topic. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Yes, I do agree. The players can sometimes create choke points. In my last session, I played Montsegur 1244 for the first time, and I got blocked when a participant killed off a character that was important for how one of my stories should continue (you play different characters in that game).  Sure, my head was zonked so if I had a clear head, I could've probably worked myself around it, but my predetermined path was blocked resulting in me reaching a choke point.<br/><br/>Player actions can create choke points as well. I remember a session of Shadowrun around ten years ago, when my character got desperate to stop another characters doings (humiliating and finally killing people), and shot him in the leg. The game master didn't know what to do, stopped the session, and retconned the whole thing the next session. It didn't happen.<br/><br/>So far in this thread I got.<br/>1. Game structure created choke points.<br/>2. Player created choke points.<br/><br/>I'm pretty satisfied with that. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397694/#Comment_397694" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-16T02:36:23+00:00" title="November 16, 2012  2:36AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If the players can fail makes complete sense.

You can have a sucessful roleplaying session even if the charactes failed to reach all their goals and horrible things happened. The players could still have fun and feel that they are doing the right thing. But if the scenario gives you the impression "You, as a player, played wrong and now it all does not work." that is kind of railroady. Because it wants you to play a certain way railroading you in style and your choices. A characters choice can be wrong in the narrative, but a players shouldn't be. If you do not want railroad. (Some scenarios want a certain genre approach and can be done wrong in that way, that could be seen as railroading, but also help the fun.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397734/#Comment_397734" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-16T10:27:09+00:00" title="November 16, 2012 10:27AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 16, 2012 10:57AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Well, I describe two options, one is 'are you doing it because it seems a workable solution' - 'it' being your advice that I quoted.

Some games might suffer a bit less from that sort of thing just because there are so many crazy-ass powers and spells and abilities floating around that there's at least a chance that someone will have taken the Swamp Guru prestige class, or be able to fly, or be able to rip a tunnel through reality to grab a small object without leaving their chair, or whatever, but it's still the kind of thing you wish module designers would think about ahead of time.

This is so far past being out of left field, it's all the way out in the parking lot.<br/><br/>Seriously, dude, I did not say a single word about allowing solutions that you don't think will work just to keep things moving. That's not what this thread was about, that's not what this discussion was about, and I'm not joking even a little bit when I say I don't know why you're talking about this. This is just depressing the hell out of me.<br/><br/><br/>One last try, I guess. As simply as I can put it, all I'm trying to say is this: if you have set a problem in front of the players, you may have a solution in mind for it. And that's fine, that's good, problems that have solutions are awesome in roleplaying games. But if the players don't hit upon the solution you had in mind and instead try something else, something that makes sense and could work, you should be open to that. (note: <i>SOMETHING THAT MAKES SENSE AND COULD WORK</i>. Sheesh.) I'm just saying, don't get all defensive and dogmatic because it's not the idea you had in mind: really think about what they're proposing to try, and honestly consider if it's a workable solution to the problem. If it is, yay. If it isn't, <i>at no point did I ever say it was a good idea to let it work anyway.</i><br/><br/>Honestly, I thought this was basic, baseline, who-could-possibly-disagree level stuff that would frankly bore the pants off of everyone who read it. "Ho hum, GMs should listen to what the players want to do and be honest about whether it would work. Heard it before, AfT, I even got it on a T-shirt and a cross-stitched sampler.

Choke points generally represent bad scenario design because it is so easy for them to get clogged (preventing the PCs from accomplishing whatever it is they want to accomplish). When a clog occurs, it can be solved by railroading the PCs through it. But that's not the only way to deal with a clog: You can also say, "Sorry, Mitt, the only road to the White House is by winning the election. You didn't do that, so you don't get to be President." Or you can become permissive as your players begin looking for alternative paths around (or through) the clog.<br/><br/>Any given mystery scenario (like <i>Masks of Nyarlathotep</i>) necessarily starts with the assumption that the PCs are interested in solving the mystery. (That doesn't mean you need to railroad them into wanting to solve the mystery; it just means that if they engage with a mystery scenario, one can assume they want to solve it.) If the only way to solve the mystery is to find a specific clue, then you've got a pretty serious choke point that can clog very easily (and clog with quick-setting cement when it does).<br/><br/>It's easy to say, "Well, that's not a problem as long as nobody cares about completing the scenario." But the players <i>do</i> care. That's why there's a problem: Once the drain is filled with cement, the water starts rising and the group starts floundering. It doesn't make for an entertaining or interesting session of gaming. And saying "they should just get out of the sink" doesn't actually solve the problem in actual practice.\n<blockquote>One of the best bits of basic GMing advice I've gotten (and given) over the years regarding chokepoints was to have at least one idea about how the PCs could get past it (two or three, even), but to not be so attached to those ideas that you won't be able to recognize a clever, workable solution just because you didn't think of it first.</blockquote>\nYears of practical knowledge suggest <a href="http://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/1118/roleplaying-games/three-clue-rule" rel="nofollow">think of three ways and be open to more</a>. The advantages of prepping three is that: (a) The scenario is robust; (b) you're not particularly wedded to any one of them; and (c) in prepping those three you've probably built up enough detail that it becomes a lot easier to deal with unexpected angles.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397806/#Comment_397806" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-17T00:05:23+00:00" title="November 17, 2012 12:05AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 17, 2012 12:22AM by Rickard.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do agree with the rest of your post.\n<blockquote>Years of practical knowledge suggest <a href="http://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/1118/roleplaying-games/three-clue-rule" rel="nofollow">think of three ways and be open to more</a>.</blockquote>\nI just create problems, never solutions. I remember one time when I prepared twelve different ways to escape from imprisonment and the players made up a thirteenth way. That's when I realized how time-wasting it was of me to prepare any kind of solutions. But I got a rather open game style nowadays, where the players can get away with any crazy idea. The only thing I care for is how much their solutions will affect the scenario, both in magnitude and consequence.<br/><br/>On the other hand, when I'm not railroading, I do have a number of clues that I give to the players. I also create agendas for the factions in the scenario, that will create consequences. So when I write "I come up with the problems", I think of situations like when the characters are being framed, being locked in or being attacked - in general, when the players has to respond on something I throw at them. The clues and the agendas are things that happen when the players act. Something that I have to respond on. If a NPC has an agenda like "Wants the Scarlet Dagger" and the PC obtains it, it will create a consequence of some sort. If the players do <i>anything</i> like talking to a person or walking somewhere, I give out a clue. As you can tell, my clues are not depending on a place or a certain person. It's what people said before in the thread: it's not about finding the clues, but what you do with them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397867/#Comment_397867" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-17T15:09:29+00:00" title="November 17, 2012  3:09PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Sure, but does that change my point?

I had even experienced this feeling with my own games, and I know that writers sometimes feel the same thing when they are writing a book.<br/><br/>It's a kind of <a href="http://imbuildingsomething.blogspot.se/2010/09/flow-er-model-introduction.html" rel="nofollow">flow state</a> where every action that the players take will create a reaction from the scenario itself. All the pieces fall together on place and your players actions and your scenario creates a symbiosis (a give and take relation) where a story is created organically.  There is no end, but there will be a problem.  The players may try to solve it in any kind of way, but it really doesn't matter because when they do, their actions will make the story twist and turn. And that's what's important.<br/><br/>There are games that got scenario structure to create this. I never game mastered with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorcerer_(role-playing_game)#Bang" rel="nofollow">bangs</a>, but from what I've been told, it's about creating (character-related) problems and see how the players react. Another structure is what the Swedish scene calls the <a href="">the fishtank</a>.

I usually dislike railroading in games, but I don't see much railroading being talked about.  Maybe we have different definitions.  <br/><br/>In my experience, railroading never has choke points.  Ever.  You go wherever the GM wants you to and do what he or she wants and only what he or she wants.  You succeed whenever they want you to, fail if they don't, and wind up at the point they want you to be at when they want you to.  A brilliant and apparent example is if a character walks through a door, they hear it lock behind them, they try to pick it, succeed on the roll, but the lock pick breaks in the lock so the door is still impassable because the GM wants the character to go forward into a dungeon crawl they prepared.  By the same token, it could also go down if they need to get through a locked door, fail to pick it, fail to break it, and the door inexplicable swings open because the GM needs them in there so they can live out his or her novel.  <br/><br/>In an example above, you need to navigate a swamp to get a ring a ring to kill a monster to save a village.  I don't see a sticking point in this situation if you fail the navigate swamp check.  If you fail to navigate the swamp as you intended, you get lost, find some bandits attacking some merchants, PC's save them (being a roaming band of merry adventurers who can't turn down a plea for help), the merchants give you a map to a temple that has a treasure in it as thanks, they lead you there for good measure before saying goodbye, the treasure turns out to be the very ring you need to kill the monster to save the village.  This would "complete the module" as intended by the GM, but you should probably be able to do a lot of fun stuff with this scenario even if the PC's don't want to.  PC's could side with the monster instead of the villagers (I find it more realistic that people would more naturally side with the side that has a better chance of winning if they are "in character" because most real people don't want to die), go the the swamp to get the ring, go to the village, destroy the ring in front of them to break their spirit and take away all hope so they will never up rise against their rightful master (the monster) and avoid the need to kill them all.  <br/><br/>I am having a hard time trying to see the sticking points in this discussion.

Imagine that you play a dungeon crawl and the players goal is to make the character learn to play the flute. Would following that goal be railroading? I can't really see how lifting forth something that the players want as raily. It can be (like expecting the players to behave in a certain way), but it doesn't have to be.\n<blockquote><blockquote>There is no end, but there will be a problem.</blockquote>I think this is probably an unfair comparison then - if you consider failing to beat the monster as not being an end, then does it still seem like railroading?</blockquote>\nHaving a monster to beat at the end of the scenario usually creates rails. Mostly because you create an expectation of what the players should do. What I'm talking about is problems that occur when the characters is doing something (usually by following their goals). In the Spirit of the Century example, problems occur when they get their hands on an orb. Is it raily to decide that  the players get the hand on the orb? Perhaps. It depends on how it's done. Perhaps they got the orb during a previous adventure and the GM wanted to create something out if it. Perhaps the player made up that the character had the orb from the start. But what will happen after that is pretty open because it depends on what the players do now when people are after the orb.<br/><br/>So if the monster is one of those who are chasing the orb, it doesn't have to be a railroad. How they avoid or defeat the monster is still up to the players.\n<blockquote>I guess I'd ask whether a consented to railroading seems okay, or seems just the same as regular railroading still?

I use it a lot myself when I want to create a certain feeling. I dunno if it's worth continue this discussion.

It's a collaborate storytelling game, so I can't really see how anyone can be railroaded there.</blockquote>\nI think they have accepted being on a track to a fixed conclusion. Other than that it still seems to be railroading. Perhaps call it 'participationism', since it's railroading that is known and consented to.</blockquote>\nHonestly, my definition of railroading is pretty wide but even I can't say that following a participant's goal is railroading. Imagine that you play a dungeon crawl and the players goal is to make the character learn to play the flute. Would following that goal be railroading? I can't really see how lifting forth something that the players want as raily. It can be (like expecting the players to behave in a certain way), but it doesn't have to be.</blockquote>\nI think if you don't look at the 'you cannot die until you reach your destiny' rule and only look at 'the character pursues their goal' as if it's by itself, it's not a fair evaluation.\n<blockquote>Having a monster to beat at the end of the scenario usually creates rails. Mostly because you create an expectation of what the players should do.</blockquote>\nI think if it's treated that you actually did something wrong/did something that douchey if you fail to beat the monster, then yeah.<br/><br/>Otherwise there are atleast two endings. Maybe you like the monster and let it go - so you fail the scenario. But as long as losing isn't treated as misbehaving at the game table, then you made your choice on the matter.<br/><br/>Totally pay that it's possible to have a much larger number of endings.\n<blockquote>Like I said in my first post. I have nothing against railroads. I use it a lot myself when I want to create a certain feeling. I dunno if it's worth continue this discussion. It just feels now that we're going around in circles, which is something that usually  happens when a discussion spans over a number of days.</blockquote>\nI think I want to make distinctions between A: 'okay with known and consented to railroading' and B: 'okay with railroading'. So the value of continued conversation <i>seems</i> to be in circles unless the distinction is made clear.\n<blockquote>In the last game of Fiasco, when one of the players where a rock star, we got "parasitic" as a relationship that was connected to "An airplane owned by a African dictator" in some way.

While 'rise again' surely doesn't refer to undead in that setting, does it? Surely it just means a presumed dead character wasn't dead.

So instead say you beat the monster, perhaps various greatful town folk come up with offers of various kinds (not just one offer, but two or more and the PC's choose between). Even if they fail to beat the monster, the consequences leave various different ways (again, not just one but two or more) that they can help mitigate the damage/help people escape by. As is, the monster scenario isn't written with various leads extending off of it - it's just written as an ending (which probably works as a one shot, or end of campaign thing).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398257/#Comment_398257" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-20T18:59:31+00:00" title="November 20, 2012  6:59PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Missed this one.\n<blockquote>The parasitic plane seems different as well - it seems to be 'We cannot link these two things in our imagination', which is different from 'I cannot guess the solution the GM has imagined'</blockquote>\nAnd it's totally different than "We failed a roll and cannot go on". There ARE several ways in how choke points are created and how they look like depends on how the game is played. The thing is, because the plane was a part of the prep of the scenario, we had to solve this before we moved one. Hence, a choke point. We moved on by partly ignoring the plane. But that's similar in my mind to ignoring a failed roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398469/#Comment_398469" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-22T14:58:37+00:00" title="November 22, 2012  2:58PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 22, 2012 3:00PM by Callan_S.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The difference I'm refering to is that I think the individual has full capacity to get through that, nothing is stopping them.
