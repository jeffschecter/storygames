(Though I acknowledge that more likely it will end in tears, recrimination, and gnashing of teeth. But hey, it's worth a try.)<br/><br/>So it seems like a lot of threads devolve into specious arguments and poo-flinging here on Story-Games. Sure, sometimes it's to be expected - like with my JRPG thread. Hell, that's like going up to a biker in a bar and saying "hey, do you think your girlfriend's ugly or is it just me?". But a lot of times, people are just trying to have a conversation about something when other people invade the thread and start crapping all over it by declaiming anyone who agrees with the thread op and flinging personal attacks while tenaciously clinging to some imagined moral high ground.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/duty_calls.png"/><br/>(taken from XKCD, link <a href="http://xkcd.com/386/" rel="nofollow">here</a>)<br/><br/>I think that comics pretty much sums up what happens here. People get so caught up in being RIGHT that they forget that other people might have equally valid perspectives, or that they might not be a native English speaker, or that they might have been tired while writing their post, or that they might have been distracted by a podcast while writing, or one of a million factors that might obscure the original intent. Hell, a lot of the time people spend a few days shouting at each other in a thread only to discover they were talking about the same thing.<br/><br/>Frankly, I'd like to see some civility. I'd like to see conversations that don't always devolve in horrible personal attacks where people dogpile the thread OP by calling them a racist, or a sexist, or a prude, or communist, or an elitist or whatever until the person who started the thread gives up and walks away.<br/><br/>But maybe that's asking too much.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253091/#Comment_253091" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T08:40:11+00:00" title="January 27, 2010  8:40AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 27, 2010 8:43AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Anna, <br/><br/>Thanks for starting this thread! <br/><br/>Tell me more about the hellpit aspect of the site. In comparison with other Internet forums, is it better? Worse? About the same? I know this is subjective. I try to avoid the really contentious threads that become bitter and stupid and suspect I am a little bit Pollyanna about the whole issue.<br/><br/>I am totally with you about reading charitably - many, many posters here are not native English speakers and/or live in vastly different time zones. Many are living in circumstances that are strained or stressful. Many times the medium just gets in the way. If somebody comes off as blunt, or passive-aggressive, or just a bag of dicks, it is almost certainly not their intention. Walk away and try again later, that's my advice. Assume good intentions and flawed execution. Assume a love of our shared hobby. In the rare cases where this charitable reading proves to be misguided, it becomes obvious over time and you can deal with those specific instances.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253096/#Comment_253096" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T08:51:44+00:00" title="January 27, 2010  8:51AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 27, 2010 9:04AM by lordgoon.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I heartily endorse what Jason says. My diagnosis of the problem is this - there is a deep divide in our culture between people who spend their working hours with people they're comfortable talking to, and people who spend their working hours having to exude vacuous positivity all day. This is a singularly depressing fact, but it's not going away any time soon. In my experience, it's almost always folks in the latter group who either go berzerk on the internet because they see it as an outlet, or else bewail the fact that others are going berzerk and try to impose some sort of informal censorship according to their own (usually pretty arbitrary) standards of civility.<br/><br/>I am lucky enough to be able to spend my working hours in an environment where I don't have to self-censor or exude Reaganite mock-cheerfulness. My heart goes out to those who do, but it would be a disaster for me if I ever allowed their grouchiness to ruin my mood or their puritanism to hijack my conversational manner.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek" title="wundergeek"><img alt="wundergeek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_g1t5HfNJ47o/TJeoZAeG69I/AAAAAAAAAfQ/clp1K8KZ75o/s400/domo-avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek">wundergeek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253097/#Comment_253097" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T08:53:41+00:00" title="January 27, 2010  8:53AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Hey Anna,Tell me more about the hellpit aspect of the site.</blockquote>\nSee, the thing that makes me sad is that I WANT a community like Story-Games. The Forge is just too academic for me, my eyes start to glaze over whenever I even look at the thread titles over there. (And hey, it fills a need. There are people who want to talk academically about gaming. Cool. I'm just not one of them.) And RPGnet is even more poo-flingy than S-G by about a factor of ten. But the anger and the threadcrapping and the personal attacks and the Internet Crazy make me periodically swear off Story-Games. And then I get sad because there are people who I really like that I lose touch with, and I lose touch with what's going on out there in Design Land, so I come back. But then the shouting and the craziness and the anger is still there, and it makes me sad.<br/><br/>Okay, so true story. I used to post over on Knife Fight. When it first started up, I was totally like that cartoon. I got totally absorbed in Internet Crazy and would spew bile and other stuff like that. But the structure of the forum helped me realize that I was being One Of Those Assholes On The Internet. There were a lot of times on Knife Fight in which someone could step forward and say 'whoa, we're getting tied up in Internet Crazy here, let's step back'. And people would step back and attempt to find common ground. <br/><br/>But a lot of the time here when people try to step forward and say 'whoa, I didn't say that, let me clarify' or 'how about we step back a moment and calm down here', the response is 'FUCK YOU, I SHALL RESPOND WITH PERSONAL ATTACKS'.<br/><br/>Anyway. I'm not sure I know how to fix any of this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ColinC" title="ColinC"><img alt="ColinC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ColinC">ColinC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253102/#Comment_253102" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T09:06:41+00:00" title="January 27, 2010  9:06AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 27, 2010 9:08AM by ColinC.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wundergeek</cite>Frankly, I'd like to see some civility.

There are plenty of civil threads on Story Games, and a lot of intelligent conversation. I have enough time and focus for exactly one RPG forum - so far S-G is it.<br/><br/>That being said, there are days when the signal to noise ratio falls too low. On those days I go do something in the real world - draw a picture, play a game, engage in real human conversation with someone without the use of a computer. It helps put things in perspective.<br/><br/>If someone says something to you directly or indirectly here that really bothers you, whisper them about it (after taking some time away from the computer). Whisper is your friend. People act differently in private conversations and are more willing to reflect on their words if you address and engage them privately and directly. And, as Jason said, quite often it's a case of good intentions and flawed execution. We are missing a *serious* amount of information bandwidth here, which is why I consider the internet as a placeholder for face-to-face interaction, not a substitute.<br/><br/>If direct engagement doesn't work, ignore them. Either by choice (which is what I do), or by mechanical means (as Jason discussed).<br/><br/>In an ideal world, the internet would work like this...<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/internet_argument.png"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse" title="xenomouse"><img alt="xenomouse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z36/xenomouse/tophat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse">xenomouse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253103/#Comment_253103" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T09:07:41+00:00" title="January 27, 2010  9:07AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 27, 2010 9:08AM by xenomouse.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt;&gt;Anyway.

Sometimes, I see people get shouted down (rarely) or silenced (more often) or ignored (all the time) largely because they're not within the  political idenity of the indie games community (which is to say, not quite left-of-center enough or something). I don't begrudge people their politics. But, I abhor the level to which I observe politics defining discourse in my hobby. For examples, think of any thread about sexism, race etc. Far too few are civil. And, in some cases, even the civil ones make me want to vomit when I see people who aren't liberals receive silly passive agression. (For the record, I'm an independent moderate, not a conservative). It is a political bubble wonderland. It used to make me angry or sad. Now it just makes me want to go away.<br/><br/>Third, there are no reliable, concrete mechanisms to moderate the community. There is the zen, and it's imperfect. I know Andy and like him a helluva lot. I just don't think he has the time or desire to police people. I don't blame him. I don't either. But, things get stupid, and then sometimes get Even More Stupid. Yes, it's the internet. But, I have seen communities operate better (and, yeah, we've all seen the operate worse, too). <br/><br/>Fourth, once again in my opinion, this community is too small an insular. This is slightly paradoxical given my preceeding comments. If this place grew bigger, my complaints above would be even worse. But, particularly for the sake of publishing games, I'd like to see these kick ass games reach larger audiences. Similarly, my pie-in-the-sky dream is that the existing SG community's enthusiasm for games became broader. Few will agree with me on that, and that's ok. I'm having a hard time explaining what I mean by it. Basically, I wish there were more "you got your story games peanut butter in my trad game chocolate!" and as a result games regularly sold to a few thousand instead of a few dozen or hundred.<br/><br/>Fifth, I'm jealous of Jason Morningstar.

Of course I tend to avoid the ones that get boring for me, or are not relevant to my interests. I do think I simply get bored at a lot of back and forth sniping. I do think that some people blow things out of proportion, especially when arguing about such tiny details of a subject. It seems that I don't usually see people using Phil's method of letting people know how they feel when someone says something. Even the most savvy of us don't realize how we come across in print or in real life, and it's a cold splash of water when someone has the guts to let us know. <br><br>I think there are three things that anyone can do to make communication (here, and in real life) more pleasant.<br/><br/>1. If someone makes you feel bad, let them know.<br/>2. Be polite about it.<br/>3. Make amends whenever possible.<br/><br/>I would also say to avoid subjects that make you upset, but that's impossible to know. In light of that, I'd say avoid subjects that seem boring to you. I can only think of negative things when I'm dealing with stuff I don't care about.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253147/#Comment_253147" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T10:43:56+00:00" title="January 27, 2010 10:43AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: C.

When a forum begins, you get social currency (attention OR good feelings) by posting thoughtful and insightful things. But the moment someone gains social currency by being unpleasant, it erodes the community. Because-- even if you try to only get social currency by being thoughtful and insightful-- everyone knows, deep down, the easier path to social currency is to be loud or unpleasant. That knowledge makes it more difficult to back down when someone else is a jerk, or resist being clever at someone else's expense. A community, as a whole, will always slowly gravitate towards the easiest way to get social currency. That's entropy at work.<br/><br/>In an ideal world, people would be as disgusted by people thumping their chests over how horrible Viet Nam was as they were about the idea that it was a good intentioned thing gone wrong. Sam wasn't trying to get social currency by being provocative, I don't think. But the second the troll started baiting him, a lot of people realized there was social currency to be had with derailing the thread and dogpiling about the horrors of war, and that's what happened. And it did nothing but make the posters feel better, raise said posters in each other's mutual esteem, and lower the tone of discourse on Story Games in general.<br/><br/>The only way to combat the entropy is to withhold social currency, which is difficult to do without a ton of groupthink or strong moderation, neither of which Story Games has in quantities high enough to do this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253155/#Comment_253155" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T10:52:09+00:00" title="January 27, 2010 10:52AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 27, 2010 10:53AM by Matt Snyder.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I'm being flip, Ryan.

But the only way to fix the community without moderation or ignore features is to have the vast majority of the forum stop rewarding poor behavior, and that's a nigh-impossible feat-- because if everyone stops giving social currency for easy-to-do things, that means everyone stops <i>getting</i> social currency for easy-to-do things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253207/#Comment_253207" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T12:35:25+00:00" title="January 27, 2010 12:35PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bret Gillan</cite>To go back to the original post, and the "how to engage with undesired forum interactions constructively" my two main strategies are to either ignore the person, or relate the argument back to myself or my experiences or whatever.

They just don't. People who are in real life very pleasant and agreeable people will behave deplorably on the internet. And no I'm not pointing fingers at anyone, so please don't assume that I'm talking about yooooooouuuuuuuu. (Seriously.)<br/><br/>To the people who say 'I don't see a problem', I think that might be because there are so many of us who just feel like it isn't worth the hassle of making ourselves heard through all the shouting. There is a sizeable population of lurkers here on S-G and while I won't speak for them, I can speak for myself as someone who goes through months-long lurking periods here that often when recriminations start to fly and strawman arguments and personal attacks get used to derail threads, it's just easier to give up.<br/><br/>I can tell you that I got a lot of whispers in my JRPG thread from people who said stuff to the effect of "I sympathise with what you're saying, but I'm not going to get dragged into this". Hell, when Judd started a Maid thread, I sent him a message saying "I appreciate what you're doing, but this way lies madness" (or something like that.) And that's a problem. Those of us who want reasonable, civil discourse free from personal attacks and thread-derailment have gotten so conditioned that we let ourselves be silenced. Sure it's easy to send a personal message to one person to try for a more reasonable conversation. But when it's two, or three, or four, or ten people suddenly piling into your thread trying to make YOU the bad guy? Is it really worth the effort to draw a line in the sand and stand up for decency and civility? You bet your ass it isn't.<br/><br/>Restricting forum posts is not a satisfactory answer, because then people just spend more time stewing in their bile before they post it, making sure that things are as cuttingly worded as possible. Ignoring people who can't behave themselves is a band-aid solution, but it doesn't address the problem of conversations getting shut down. And saying 'well it's better than other places on the internet' sucks too, because it's just rationalizing a situation that sucks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253216/#Comment_253216" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T12:53:57+00:00" title="January 27, 2010 12:53PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            About 10 years ago, I (mostly accidentally) started following a specific strategy when someone would disagree with a post I made in a forum. It's made using forums more pleasant, at least from my point of view. On the minus side, it can be hard to do. On the plus side, it is an approach that is entirely in your hands and doesn't rely on changing other people's behavior (which isn't your job). Works like this:<br/><br/>1) When confronted by a post that disagrees with what you are saying (regardless of the tone of that disagreement), make the assumption that the reason for the disagreement is that <i>your original post didn't actually say what you meant it to say</i>. That is, the person is disagreeing because they didn't understand what you are saying and this is not because they are stupid, but because your writing sucks.<br/><br/>2) Regardless if there is evidence to support the assumption that you are being misunderstood or not, or even if the idea of it doesn't even make any sense to you, <i>proceed as if this assumption is true</i>, even if you are sure it isn't. Clarify the point you are making, totally ignoring any inflammatory stuff that may or may not have been in the reply. Use an example if you can.<br/><br/>3) Repeat until any misunderstanding is cleared up or you are convinced that the person really does disagree with you. All the while, be just as polite as can be, even in the face of asshattery.<br/><br/>4) Once you reach this point, the other person has heard what you have to say. You've heard what he's had to say. You disagree. So, most important point: now you're done. There is no further need to pay attention to this person in this matter or belabor the point. You will not convince him. He will not convince you. Just move on, without any further explanation or comment at all. If you are continuing in the thread talking to <i>other</i> readers, feel free to read the disagreeing guy's posts, but make no response to them, or even recognition that they were made.<br/><br/>That's it. Now, when you read it said like that, it seems really stupid.<br/><br/>But damned if it doesn't work.<br/><br/>If enough people in a forum take this (or a similar) approach, the net effect usually turns out to prevent the "social currency from being a douchebag" from being gained, or even perceived. I'm not sure why this happens, but it's been the case more often than not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253217/#Comment_253217" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T12:54:39+00:00" title="January 27, 2010 12:54PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Bret, encouraging people to ground their discussion in games they are actually playing is a great idea.

Something brought to my attention in private kinda rings against the above.<br/><br/>Are having sincere, deep feelings on a subject, as well as historical research and sometimes firsthand experience, equal to "attempting to gain social currency"?<br/><br/>I mean, Chris Chinn does the same thing in threads about Race. Brand R, Julia, joepub and others do the same thing on sexism/feminism. Others have hot-button issues like "cultural appropriation". They're so frustrated with armchair talkers (I'd say "armchair academics", but there's no academia from the talker) that their well-informed contributions to the thread usually end sharply in diatribes, expressions of being ashamed for engaging in the thread, perhaps an angry/upset blog post somewhere, and the thread is followed by others nodding soberly...<br/><br/>Personally, I don't think folks like Chris, Brand etc are in it for the social currency gained on webforums. I don't rain like a storm of hammers on a rare outburst from a person when they've stumbled upon a personal button-pushing topic. I don't egg Chris on, going "Hey, is that all you have to contribute here? Just telling us you're not participating?", or "Well, I guess that's the best we can expect to hear from Brand. OK white guys, let's get 'deeper' into our feminist RPG critique" I let folks get it out of their system, and as long as it (and the topics that spawn the ire) don't become commonplace, all resolves rather quickly and cleanly, and hey sometimes there's some valuable insights from those folks (hidden here and there in a long-ass thread) which pop out every now and again (not all the time, mind, but hey: Internet and all that).<br/><br/>So here's the thing:<br/>* I'm not comfortable as a moderator with saying: "OK, anyone who has an emotional outburst in a thread is just gunning for social currency. Leave your Voice at the door, and just walk away and let us continue our totally uninformed yet judgmental discussion."<br/><br/>* Nor am I at all comfortable with separating topics which are "allowed" to evoke emotional responses with ones that aren't.<br/>"OK, Racism, Sexism and Sexual Abuse are "<b>IN</b>": If you have a rare freak-out over these topics, you're simply genuinely 'frustrated that the other has their head up their ass and had to vent once'. Cultural Appropriation, Feminism, and Cultural Imperialism* are "<b>OUT</b>": If you have a rare public freak-out over these topics, you're just gunning the crowd for social currency because you want others to think highly of you."<br/><br/>No. Neither is gonna happen.<br/><br/>Instead, a little venting steam is tolerable IMO. And some self-control involving not baiting the people whose buttons you're pressing. For a concrete example: That Vietnam thread outburst would have ended with "lol". And perhaps an angry blog post somewhere on whatever blog droog uses.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>* (droog/Jeff's freak-out topic)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253233/#Comment_253233" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T13:34:16+00:00" title="January 27, 2010  1:34PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>Hey everyone.

Maybe that's a crude way to look at it, but hey, it keeps me civil in online discourse.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I generally hold politeness and manners in very high regard anyway, which makes my hot button not a particular topic but the actual manner of posting. So for the most part, the only thing that is going to make me want to punch somebody (or anything leading up to it) is blatant rudeness and basic disrespect.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with that is anybody engaging in those behaviors is usually doing it with malicious purpose. They also know that nobody can punch them through the internet and are happy to take advantage of it. What was it R.E.H. had Conan say? Something about civilized men having the worst manners because they know they're not a second away from having their skulls split open.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's all just a basic animal behavior issue for me cross-referenced with a simple cost/benefit analysis. You can't win an argument on the internet. If you're arguing you've already lost. The only thing anyone will remember without Googling the discussion is that you lost your head and acted like a jerk. And without the option of maximum escalation any vitriol exchanged will be ultimately fruitless and undecisive (plus frustrating and unsatisfying).<br/>\n<br/>\nIssues of rudeness and disrespect are never defused by fighting fire with fire anyway (you either escalate, which we've noted isn't possible, or you maintain your copacetic). The person slinging them at you probably wants you to get riled and upset. That's sort of the point. So don't do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I should say that I also prefer heavier moderation than SG has, which can go a long way towards replacing other repercussions for jerky behavior.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253266/#Comment_253266" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T14:32:32+00:00" title="January 27, 2010  2:32PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 27, 2010 2:36PM by Elizabeth.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><cite>Posted By: Elizabeth</cite>Railing against the fundamental topic of the thread in angry diatribes where you express how ashamed you feel for engaging in the thread at face value initially is simply solicitation for people to nod soberly and say "Wow, you're an insightful guy, I respect your anti-war stance."</blockquote>\nNot to butt in too much, I want to see this discussion play out without too much of my involvement, but...<br><br>Hmmm. Something brought to my attention in private kinda rings against the above.<br><br>Are having sincere, deep feelings on a subject, as well as historical research and sometimes firsthand experience, equal to "attempting to gain social currency"?<br><br>Mmmhmm. They sure are. At least in a thread about "How do I do this thing I have set out to do?"* Not so much in a thread about "Is this thing I want to do possible/morally superior/okay with all of you guys?"<br><br>I also think linking Chris and Brand, who have lots of intelligent and insightful things to say (and usually calmly, too, because they're out to educate and inform) with Jeff is a grave insult to Chris and Brand. I think we can pretty much agree that there's a difference between getting frustrated on a sensitive topic and grumping about it and what happened in that thread. My feelings on the war are closer to Jeff's than Sam's, but with Jeff's behavior I'm embarrassed to say so.<br><br><br>*I guess my question here for you, Andy, is this: would <i>you</i> rather have conversations on your forum about playing games and how to play games the way you want to play them? Or do you want to host discussions on the emotional and historical ramifications of past events in a way that is completely divorced from either story or gaming? Even if people get pissed about the content of a thread, it'd be vastly preferable if you said something like "Tie it into the game talk or go home" then it would to say "it's okay to derail a thread if you have a degree or personal experience with a related but tangential topic."                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253267/#Comment_253267" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T14:33:29+00:00" title="January 27, 2010  2:33PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 27, 2010 2:35PM by Brendan.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Forum software, and comment-response software in general, has a fundamental unsolved bug that induces negative social interactions.<br><br/>I'm not joking.  I've been thinking about this since a friend of mine (the guy who started, and subsequently shut down, Segfault.org) came up with the <a href="http://www.crummy.com/2001/10/28/0" rel="nofollow">Tar Pit From Hell Theory</a> in 2001:\n<blockquote>"When you add a public discussion forum to your site you are placing your site on a big slab of plexiglass which floats around on the Tar Pit From Hell. As long as no one actually uses the discussion forum, you are safe. But the more people pile on to use the discussion forum, the deeper your site sinks into the Tar Pit From Hell. There are various measures you can take to slow your descent into the Tar Pit From Hell, but none of them deal with the fundamental problem, which is the fact that your site is sinking into a damn tar pit."</blockquote>\nI know Andy's resistant to the idea of installing forum mods that would make social currency concrete here (eg upvotes/downvotes, poster ranks, ignore buttons, etc).  I think that's fair, because they come with their own sets of problems.  But I think a lot of us can agree that, given a clear social contract, <i>good game rules mostly produce good social interaction, and bad ones mostly don't.</i><br/><br/>In short, system matters.  Doesn't it seem plausible that software matters too?  If so, how would you apply forum rules in software?                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253269/#Comment_253269" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T14:43:40+00:00" title="January 27, 2010  2:43PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as I'm concerned, Elizabeth wins this thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot sure how much social currency that's worth ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253270/#Comment_253270" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T14:45:52+00:00" title="January 27, 2010  2:45PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now you're all doing it on purpose.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253274/#Comment_253274" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T14:49:30+00:00" title="January 27, 2010  2:49PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're not gonna earn much social currency with such a sour disposition, Bret.

We haven't been taught them in Real Life because let me tell you, if we were in this situation is real life, it would implode. its too ridonculus to make rules to fix, because it shouldn't really exist in the first place. You think people aren't ass hats, bad debators, intellectually dishonest in real life? Damn right they are, and the basic solution to fix that is to Physcially Remove yourselves from their area of influence. We would never get to this kind of petty bs in real life, because i'm sure most of the people would have dispersed or had a fist fight, or hot homoerotic sex or something. And that isn't bad, all these actions , are very human, mostly harmless and sometimes funny. We can't rule it, because theirs no particular action that is allowable. Sometimes its okay to be snarky, sometimes its okay to be an ass, sometimes its okay to tell Jason Morningstar to fuck off. The second you define a rule, you will have everybody and their brother will be running for the edge of the allowable as a new kind of internet based extreme sport. <br/><br/>The alternative, use your mind and apply common sense, talk less about invisible things (in which i include actual play oddly enough), and understand that zen is not an artifact but a process so STFU and GTFO LAWLS<br/><br/>Man I've written this up like three times and deleted it twice because I'm sure that I'll just get dismissed for more or less offering a solution instead of theory and nicities, but hey 3rd times a charm right? OMG Yawls People are People too imagine that. It just annoys me that people I more or less dig on the internet can't pull their head out of their asses most of the time to see their problems are for the most part, the appeal part of them. <br/><br/>Anwayy                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253293/#Comment_253293" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T15:34:30+00:00" title="January 27, 2010  3:34PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Hey if I was being seen as a troll, it's much more useful that someone to let me know instead of having two+ spinoff threads about people being mean on the internet.</p>\n<p>I think arguing with someone you vehemently disagree with is more useful and socially productive than staying silent or attempts at awkward internet therapy.

I think a perfectly reasonable response would be "fuck you" and maybe some pictures of concentration camp survivors. Indeed, that would be a more productive response than any response helping them figure out how to play their game.<br/><br/>Note that in this case it doesn't actually matter if the original poster is well-intentioned. They are still a troll, in the formal definition, and they still deserve to be told "fuck you," not so much for the troll but for the content of it.<br/><br/>As the descendant of survivors, I give a total high five to Jeff. Completely proper response to trolling. <br/><br/>* I know, Godwin, but I've chosen this example because I have the same personal relationship to WWII as Jeff has to the Vietnam War.

For a virtually unmoderated place, it does seem to go fairly well, but then my previous statement still applies.<br/><br/>I'm a moderator on Yog-sothoth.com, the board for Cthulhu gaming (which is down at the moment for rebuilding but will be back very soon). We have some rules about posting which basically amount to "don't be an asshat". If someone is an asshat, a moderator usually pops up and tells them not to be an asshat and they calm down. A lot of the time, we'll get messages from other users asking us to sort things out, partly because one of the rules is about getting moderators to sort things out, and partly because posters trust our judgement. Although occasionally we do make mistakes but these have so far always been sorted out.<br/><br/>If ashattery persists, it's three strikes and you're out. We've probably banned less than 20 people in 10 years (not counting spammers).

This is slightly paradoxical given my preceeding comments. If this place grew bigger, my complaints above would be even worse. But, particularly for the sake of publishing games, I'd like to see these kick ass games reach larger audiences. Similarly, my pie-in-the-sky dream is that the existing SG community's enthusiasm for games became broader. Few will agree with me on that, and that's ok. I'm having a hard time explaining what I mean by it. Basically, I wish there were more "you got your story games peanut butter in my trad game chocolate!" and as a result games regularly sold to a few thousand instead of a few dozen or hundred.</blockquote>\nOK, I've seen this disconnect a few times and I hope to address that a bit:<br/><br/>A few years ago, S-G was basically "The Forge's Yearly Birthday Forum, just 24/7 instead of one week!" I also had a clearly defined goal of "I want this site to be about discussing play. I don't care so much about design/marketing/whatnot, but I don't mind if it gets discussed here: There's a lot of Forge-circle folks here, and to boot not a lot of folks in general, so such discussions won't impede or waylay "Play-Focused" discussions.<br/><br/>In the past year or so, the place grew just too big to keep Game Design and Marketing Talk (all that "let's talk about the Indie Community and What We're Doing!" chat) alongside the threads for d20 and In A Wicked Age houserule threads. I decided to do the "Core Competency" dance, and knowing that it would shrink the total number of threads that appear here (and realizing my goal was never "the biggest site", "the most threads"), I shuffled all that Game Design talk over to that new forum up there called Praxis. I need to post a better entry portal, and (when I have some research time) to finally pull all the Game Design Help threads off this S-G database and migrate them over to the Praxis database. But that's the place to talk about design and marketing here (from a designer/marketer perspective).<br/><br/>It's small, there's not a lot of traffic, but the people using it seem to be getting something of the focused attention due to the smaller user base. It's free of politics (for now anyway), and it's the kind of place where Marketing and Design Speak have a place to exist, where they no longer really have a place here: This place is for Play Discussion. <br/><br/>It's a recent change, and I hope it makes sense. Some people will find Praxis useful, perhaps many more won't. But it's there anyway, if people want to give it a shot.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253349/#Comment_253349" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T22:10:52+00:00" title="January 27, 2010 10:10PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 27, 2010 10:13PM by Johnstone.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>It's called cognitive dissonance,</blockquote>\nYeah, tell me about it!<br/><br/>Like, I can see why you'd want to play a war-based rpg that isn't all about why-we-did-this-immoral-thing; and yet I can't really see how you can rescue the police action in Vietnam from being the utter total cock-up that it was.<br/><br/>And I can understand being offended at people ignoring ugly truths; but telling somebody to fuck themselves on the internet never solves anything.

I just can't see the point in being overtly aggressive. How does that benefit the poster, the recipient or the community?<br/><br/>One other thing: Expressing disappointment at the actions of others <i>in general</i> is a big pet peeve of mine. Expressions like "there are a lot of threads with poo-slinging", "this kind of behavior is just fishing for social currency", "personal attacks start to derail threads" just get to the paranoid part of my emotional system. Kind of like a boss sending an e-mail to his subjects saying "Some of you are lazy and you know it. Pick it up!".<br/><br/>I know that this problem is on my end and is not probably shared. And, in the above paragraph I'm guilty of the same thing I'm supposed to be criticizing. I'm sorry about that and I don't mean to upset anyone. <br/><br/>Still, personally I would prefer these kinds of dissatisfactory things to be primarily handled in a case-by-case basis. If not, there is a potential problem of only the people that really care about the warm community aspect of the forum discussing problems in the thread where problems are discussed. Possibly getting all over-self-reflective of their own way of posting because the problems are discussed in a vague, general way. And some of the people who should really be a part of those discussions may ignore the thread altogether, making the impact of the said discussions minimal in practice.<br/><br/>Still, this thread has been a good read for me and for the sake of everyone feeling comfortable to contribute as much as they like this kind of meta discussion is good. I guess I'm just saying that it's not enough for me, something more needs to be done. Lester's advice is a good starting point, as is addressing hurting, grief or abusive actions right as they happen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/boulet" title="boulet"><img alt="boulet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/534/nTWF4B3HT5CT6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/boulet">boulet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253361/#Comment_253361" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-28T00:17:24+00:00" title="January 28, 2010 12:17AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>It's called cognitive dissonance, and it's how people fundamentally work.</blockquote>\nQFT. <br/><br/>When I read Jeff's reaction I frowned at the epidermic way he reacted. At the same time I could transpose how I would feel if someone was to say something along the lines of "every French colons in Algeria were fascist pigs" (my mother's side of the family used to live in Algeria before 1962). It would be pretty mild compared to the anger Jeff felt, still it would probably put me in a similar "FUCK YOU" mode. <br/><br/>A thread starting with an aggressive political/moral stance, even disguised as a game preference exploration, is bound to degenerate. Either the topic was legitimate and members learn to live with the highly emotional answers. Or the topic was off limit. It doesn't mean everyone have to agree with the form and/or content of those reactions. <br/><br/>Now if Jeff had gone on, and on, and on, spinning out of control that would have been an other story.

A couple of points.<br/><br/>To the people who think this is a rather civil place free of shoutiness... Um. That's not everyone's experience. I know that I have yet to try to discuss sexism in gaming without being called a sexist. I know that I also had to watch a thread about Thou Art But A Warrior (that I didn't even start!!) descend into poo-flinging and accusations of racism all around. Also, when I tried to solicit help in captioning an image that I had done in an effort to re-protagonize women in fantasy art, I got dogpiled and showered with personal attacks.<br/><br/>So just to be clear, I just want to say that bad behavior is a problem that exists on this forum. That's all I'm saying. I'm not pointing fingers and saying "THESE are the Bad People". I'm just saying that that it's a thing and that it exists.<br/><br/>There's been a lot of good discussion on this, though I am sad that people keep referencing specific people as the Bad Guys. I was really hoping to avoid that. But I'd like to see some sort of concrete action taken, otherwise I'm afraid that people will behave themselves for a week before reverting to their normal poo-flinging ways. Like Logos pointed out, WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION BEFORE. And yet in the end we're still here, having this conversation again. I mean, dude. I share Logos' frustration. Totally.<br/><br/>I don't know. I realize in the end that this is Andy's place and we can't tell him how to run it. But I can't say that I have much hope that without some sort of concrete action things will actually be any different this time. Though at least this thread has been reasonably civil.

And, I do keep forgetting that Praxis even exists!<br/><br/>To clarify my own statement -- <br/><br/>I specifically mentioned that I wanted to see cross-pollination between indie and trad stuff. By "stuff" I mean players. Yes, I also talked about sales. <br/>But, what I was really on about was an expansion of players hanging out, having fun, and talking about cool games. So, that happens to some degree. But, it's still a niche of a niche of a place.<br/><br/>Anyway, I was definitely not lamenting that SG isn't the place to talk design and marketing.<br/><br/>Rather, I was lamenting that my perception of <i>gamers' perception</i> of SG is "that weird place that those fringer gamers navel gaze" rather than "that less acidic place where we can talk about cool RPGs of any stripe."<br/><br/>SO! If you're still following this goofy logic of mine, the following is GREAT: \n<blockquote>This place is for Play Discussion.</blockquote>\nBut, even in that context, I'm still standing by my point that "Gee, I wish way more people would see the barrier between traditional gaming and those weird indie games is largely artificial, and mostly social." As "story games" (as a concept, not just a site) has become socially defined, I believe we're cordoning ourselves off both as players and as publishers from a larger pool of hobbyists. I can be wrong about that, of course, in which case I lose. No biggie.<br/><br/>So, yeah, I wish SG had more people coming in and finding out cool games that aren't just, oh, Emo Facestab City, but also Kickass Fantasy Mechanic Crunch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253398/#Comment_253398" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-28T07:28:06+00:00" title="January 28, 2010  7:28AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wundergeek</cite>Like Logos pointed out, WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION BEFORE.

How would you, random Story Games person, answer these questions? <br/><br/>Some things that I've heard (and even seen, oh the irony) in this thread as negatives: Dogpiling for social currency, marginalization and alienation of different views, deliberate derailing of certain topics, all things that definitely happen at least occasionally.

"That's just the medium!" And, others, standing on the sideline saying "Yep. Electrons, man."</blockquote>\nI'm inclined to put the problem here, too (+1). I can recall some similar thread to this one, speaking of "SG Community" and I was literally shocked (not incensed; like, jaw-dropping, "Huh?") to hear folks say, "Oh, well, this isn't a community." I guess, for me, I no longer make an artificial distinction between "real life" and "teh intertubez"--I'm really still a human, really trying to help or express myself, and I really believe you mean what you say.<br/><br/>Which is why I am probably one of the WORST folks here for harshing the Zen--rhetoric pisses me off, in particular when the alleged purpose of a thread is to resolve something or debate alternatives or take a poll or tell a story. And by "rhetoric" I mean, in general, attacking the opposition rather than the argument, with the goal of swaying the Mobb, not "finding truth" or "debating" or "helping/educating."<br/><br/>And I blame Luke Crane for that, because he invented the Duel of Wits for BW. :P<br/>More seriously, though, the "shit threads" here ALL have that in common, I find: there is no more drive to debate with, be clear for, or be persuasive to the opposition--it's all about the lolz and the partisanship, applause from the sidelines. And I, personally, am really shitty when it comes to letting someone play those cards without bodyslamming them right back (and around and around we go...) or redirecting the discussion back to logic and premises, or ignoring/dismissing.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Michael Curry</cite>Can you give us an idea of what sorts of things you would consider to fall into the range of "concrete actions" that might be taken?</blockquote>\nI think it might be worth adding something like karma for a while, maybe just as an experiment. With SMF karma, one can change what the "pro" and "con" terms are, so we could soften them from Karma to, I dunno... "Works For Me" vs. "No Thanks". (At GLASScutters.org, I have SHARP vs. dull, both to echo the "glass" metaphors that will pervade the final publication but also to suggest that the buttons are used PRIMARILY to "vote" on best practices for making Templates or Packages, Hosting game events, and maintaining safety and verisimilitude. If they said "Cool Guy" vs. "Asshat" that would send a much different signal: that the karma buttons are for judging a person, not their ideas.)<br/><br/>Would it kill us to try it?<br/><br/>Also, I personally am going to  go with a Warning Policy (which won't be all as heavy as it sounds). Basically, ask as politely as I can, "Did you mean to insult me--to hurt me or for rhetorical effect--or have I somehow misunderstood this: [their quote]?" One part "tell them how X makes me feel Y" and one part "warn that the Zen is nearly harshed; time to redirect is NOW."<br/><br/>Will this work? Hell, I dunno--sometimes I'll just disregard terrible insults. My mom used to tell me her strategy of asking "Does that person owe me money? [Answer almost always will be no.] Then fuck 'em, let 'em die." Wise beyond her years, that woman (IIRC, this was advice given to me at, oh, 13 when she was, oh, 36).<br/><br/>Other times a mere slight can send me off to Foamy Rants Land. Nicotine fits and low blood sugar are bitches (that's my weak excuse, anyway)! It's those times I'll strive to remember the Polite Warning Policy (PWP) and hopefully defuse conflict before it can really start, returning discussion to something productive or fun (or both!).<br/><br/>So that's what I think *I* can do, in addition to "software" that I think can help provide a low-screetch-level means to check behavior (or drive folks away, when long term abuse gives them a downward spiral of bad karma). And both of those are mainly "patches" for dealing with the first issue above: denying the reality of virtual exchanges and forum participants. For good (respect) and for bad (taking what you give without false affront).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek" title="wundergeek"><img alt="wundergeek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_g1t5HfNJ47o/TJeoZAeG69I/AAAAAAAAAfQ/clp1K8KZ75o/s400/domo-avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek">wundergeek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253505/#Comment_253505" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-28T12:50:46+00:00" title="January 28, 2010 12:50PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Michael Curry</cite><cite>Posted By: wundergeek</cite>But I'd like to see some sort of concrete action taken, otherwise I'm afraid that people will behave themselves for a week before reverting to their normal poo-flinging ways.

Small groups can mostly get by without clear rules and strict moderation without getting too bad, as is the case here.  When you scale up the number of people involved and don't have a tight core group with the power to keep things under control, you get a disaster.<br/><br/>Mo' people, mo' problems, in other words.<br/><br/><br/>For the record, I don't think there's anything wrong with being a fairly small, insular community.  Gaming is pretty much a small, insular activity as far as I'm concerned -- it's something I do on the weekend with the same small group of friends, not something I do with thousands of strangers all the time.  This place doesn't need to have tens of thousands of posts and thousands of articles a day to keep me interested.<br/><br/>Besides, think of the folks who already complain when threads move "too fast" around here; bring more users in, and you'll drive those poor guys right out, and that would be a shame.  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253657/#Comment_253657" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T06:46:06+00:00" title="January 29, 2010  6:46AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: salvagebar</cite>Compared to most boards, SG is many standard deviations above the median for good, constructive dialogue.

Threads are regularly closed for lack of civility. <br/><br/>There are regular positive threads, where people post their achievements and others congratulate them; there's a German-language category since that's the second-largest forum userbase.

Moderation is the main thing that works, be it individual (Andy and the Ban-Hammer) or collective (karma systems).<br/><br/>Hell, look at digg: they combine a per-thread karma system with a user-selected tolerance level, making probably the BEST implementation of karma in general. I can set my tolerance to 3, and that generally keeps me from seeing posts that the community thinks are bupkiss, UNLESS I decide to click them based on the first line (which is shown sort of grayed out). Or I could set it to 5 and only see the handful of Seriously Insightful Posts in a thread. Or I could set it to 0 and watch the poo fly.<br/><br/>And the neatest thing, I think, is that it's PER-THREAD. So even if someone has a Bad Net Day and flings poo, all is forgiven in the next thread... assuming that the community as a whole doesn't karma-stomp the person's first post every time (which is basically a way for a large bloc of the community to say, "You're banned, bub"--most folks will shuffle off if they are being karma-stomped... or make new IDs. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> ).<br/><br/>And as I posted above (am I on everyone's Ignore list already?!?) I think it could be tried out for a time--say six months, to get through two of Andy's "angsty biorhythm cycles"--and the reassessed. It's not like it MUST remain activated, if it is EVER activated; it's software and can be enabled and disabled with a few mouse clicks (or at worst, an install and some clicks, and then an uninstall).<br/><br/>**heads off to check if there's an SMF plug-in that does digg-style karma**                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253738/#Comment_253738" name="Item_118" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T10:19:23+00:00" title="January 29, 2010 10:19AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WOW, OK, quick update: SMF has a "Karma-Based Message Boards" plug-in that... well, sounds genius and elitist all at the same time.

Its function in the RPGosphere is to have highbrow creative discussions with other people who get off on having highbrow creative discussions. (EDIT: Partly for its own sake and partly in the hope of leading to better games. That's cool.) But the poopyhead end of the spectrum is more poopyheady than in most other places. And actually the community is fully aware that some people in it are consistently poopy, and deals with it by saying "Psst! You don't want to talk to that person!" instead of doing something about it.<br/><br/>Certainly one of my early forays into SG led to me being savaged in a mini pile-on. For that and other reasons I don't expect to ever be a core member of the community. You can have good discussions for a while if you talk and act like a clique member, but it's not reliable. I certainly feel safer at RPGnet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253953/#Comment_253953" name="Item_127" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-30T13:38:50+00:00" title="January 30, 2010  1:38PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 30, 2010 1:52PM by lordgoon.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, this whole discussion has become positively morbid.

He left and vowed never to come back.  I think that kind of Forge-based hierarchy of knowledge has diminished a lot in the last couple of years, but there is still a hierarchy of status which I think is attributable to so many posters here being designers and having "names".  This is also a phenomenon of this place being a spin-off of the Forge, which is basically a cult of personality and strongly encouraged that kind of status hierarchy.  And the storygames movement started off being very self-congratulating, as a marketing mechanism ("Your game rocks!" "No, yours does!").<br/><br/>This combined with a very general consensus on politics and gaming ideology means that it's not a very welcoming place for a newcomer who doesn't know either the personalities or hasn't already bought into a pro-storygaming ideology.<br/><br/>It makes for a place where one poster can say something fairly outrageous or aggressive and not really get called on it and another can do something that goes against the general cultural grain and get a lot of shit for it.<br/><br/>It's also a function of size.  When a forum is really small, people welcome any newcomer. When it's really massive, people tend to look at content of the post rather than the poster.  When it's medium like this, there is a tendency to pay attention to the important people.  <br/><br/>It really reminds me of my liberal arts college, where there was a similar social dynamic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254028/#Comment_254028" name="Item_139" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T08:11:05+00:00" title="January 31, 2010  8:11AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Those of you who are joking around and adding nothing to the conversation, could you please stop?</blockquote>\nSoon as you quit misquoting me, homes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254034/#Comment_254034" name="Item_140" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T08:26:59+00:00" title="January 31, 2010  8:26AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite>This combined with a very general consensus on politics and gaming ideology means that it's not a very welcoming place for a newcomer who doesn't know either the personalities or hasn't already bought into a pro-storygaming ideology.</blockquote>\nI've been posting her about a year, and my experience has been very different - this forum *does* seem like a welcoming place to me (I've enjoyed a number of discussions, I've met some nice people, I've gotten to play some good games, etc).<br/><br/>Maybe our experiences have been different because my politics and gaming preferences align more closely with the prevailing ones.<br/><br/>But, if so, that's not an accident, or me not talking about my real interests or opinions in order to "fit in".<br/><br/>Unlike RPG.net (for example) this particular forum doesn't bill itself as a general role-playing forum for any and all kinds of gaming topics.

It seems that most of the bad behaviour here is based on posturing, ego-swelling and passive-aggressive sniping. That's hard to moderate because it's by nature a blurry line. There are people here who make posts for the same reason a kid takes a magnifying glass to an anthill. There are people here who just want to become the next 'It Designer' in this tiny sliver of a community and see others here as a means to that end.  There are the people who think that playing edgy or uncomfortable games or character concepts that this makes them hardcore visionaries, and that they have to broadcast this constantly.<br/><br/>These are the people that make the site tiresome for me. I don't even think they're the majority, but they do have the loudest voices, because they have specific agendas.<br/><br/>What to do about it? I think that somehow the site needs to veer more sharply to welcoming community of gamers and away from intellectual forum. As stated, the latter already exists in the Forge and now Praxis. Maybe there should be more forceful shunting of certain topics to Praxis. This should be a place where everyone sees and respects each other as real people, instead of Olde Internette, where you adopt a persona and play it like you would in a game (see lordgoon's unintentionally ridiculous purple prose above). It's hard to want to contribute here when you wonder if someone is trying to sell you something or just toy with you.<br/><br/>All that said, yeah, the place ain't too shabby at all in the grand scheme of things. I think Andy himself sets the proper tone for what the site should be like and is doing a good job.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254044/#Comment_254044" name="Item_142" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T08:59:35+00:00" title="January 31, 2010  8:59AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 31, 2010 9:01AM by walkerp.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: BWA</cite><br/>But, if so, that's not an accident, or me not talking about my real interests or opinions in order to "fit in".</blockquote>\nTotally.  And I know my post came off sounding fairly negative.  I should have added that despite the perspective that a lot of newcomers may see, there is good intelligent discussion here.  I was just responding to Jason Morningstar's request for more data on why some people didn't feel particularly safe as compared to rpg.net.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: BWA</cite><br/>Unlike RPG.net (for example) this particular forum doesn't bill itself as a general role-playing forum for any and all kinds of gaming topics.

But I think that their is a distinction between subject matter and viewpoint.  Keeping the forums emphasizing or favoring certain subjects is good, but that shouldn't be to the exclusion of other viewpoints.  The perspectives of gamers from outside the storygamer community are particularly valid from intellectual and marketing standpoints and a lot of times I see them being dismissed or ignored in conversation here.  Or rather, I see perspectives from people who don't have high status here being dismissed or ignored.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254048/#Comment_254048" name="Item_143" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T09:15:36+00:00" title="January 31, 2010  9:15AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Speaking to "feeling safe here" I'll add this data point because I experienced the transition from feeling unsafe/ignored to feeling safe/attended.

Buying into "the game designer is dead" turns out to help with forums as well as gaming in general, as it turns out!  <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>I mean, I'm sort of aware that there are people who perceive cliques and status around here, but I personally haven't been bothered by it.  And by that, I'm not saying it doesn't exist or that it does, I'm just saying <i>I don't care because it doesn't matter to me</i>...if someone writes something smart, funny, and useful for me here, I like it; if they write something boring and useless for me, I don't.  Doesn't matter to me who wrote it, doesn't matter if they're internet-famous or regular-famous or not famous at all, and it doesn't matter whether they're a game designer or just someone who plays games.  (Okay, that last one is a lie, I always prefer people who actually <i>play games</i>, and anyway, someone can be both a designer and an actual player, so it's kind of a non-issue.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse" title="xenomouse"><img alt="xenomouse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z36/xenomouse/tophat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse">xenomouse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254056/#Comment_254056" name="Item_146" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T09:48:17+00:00" title="January 31, 2010  9:48AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lordgoon</cite>But I'm also being completely honest when I say that 90% of the most rude and obnoxious stuff I've read on here has been delivered in the form of pleas for greater civility.</blockquote>QFT.<br/><br/>Just this thread alone contains a ton of passive aggressive snipes thinly disguised as "let's make this a better place."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254071/#Comment_254071" name="Item_147" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T10:57:14+00:00" title="January 31, 2010 10:57AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 31, 2010 10:58AM by Andy.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alright.

I  simply stop posting, log off the site, and lurk. You'd be surprised what real gems seem to float on by when you are no longer obliged to respond to them. That said, a political solution that consists of STFU, does strike me as particularly individal, group, or community building, but generally being on the outside of those anyway, I'm much more obliged to take the solution as I'm not in the group or the community really, which is how basically the clique and the insular work for those of you not in the know. <br/><br/>But hey who doesn't enjoy watching a carwreck every now and then. This forum is much more fun with heavy doses of Fuck you. I think I'm going to start treating this forum like 4chan, because quite frankly, I get less BS , less Attitude, and less Dogpiling over there. They also tend to be more helpful and friendly.
