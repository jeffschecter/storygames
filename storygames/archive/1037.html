                    Many moons ago there was a large ruckus at the Forge about how all the awesome indie RPGs weren't getting played. Several Forge posters decided that sitting around hand-wringing was unproductive.  So some early Forge-dwellers formed a sort of splinter group devoted to facilitating the actual play of those indie RPGs, and the rest of us followed.<br/>
<br/>
The group has grown since those days (we currently have 361 members) and widened our scope as the Forge's cooling mass has dissipated across the intarweb. You know about our IRC channel (#indierpgs on irc.magicstar.net), but did you know that we were originally, and primarily, a mailing list?<br/>
<br/>
Indie Net-gaming is a low-traffic mailing list that can be found at <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/indie-netgaming" rel="nofollow">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/indie-netgaming</a>. The purposes of the list is to provide a communications channel for interested gamers to meet, communicate, and schedule actual play events anywhere online.  Our members have used the list to schedule voice-based play through Ventrillo and Skype; play-by-post play on www.rpol.net, www.playbyweb.com, and other places; play by email play of all kinds; and more.<br/>
<br/>
We've even played *D&amp;D* a time or two.  But we don't talk about that.<br/>
<br/>
Among other features of the mailing list is a newsletter that is sent out to all members biweekly, and at the beginning of every month, announcing online play opportunities (as well as online games that are accepting/allowing lurkers).  With online play increasing not just on our official IRC channel but also on the semi-official Story-games MUSH (at legendary.org port 7777), we'd like to encourage everyone to take advantage of this mailing list for up-to-the-minute discussion and scheduling of game opportunities.<br/>
<br/>
As the newsletter is released, it will be posted here.  Watch for it!                </div>

                            This is the bi-weekly indie-netgaming newsletter.<br/>
<br/>
It is sent every two weeks, and at the beginning of every month, to let you know what is going on with indie-netgaming.  It is recommended that you post and read the mailing list as a more current, and consistently faster, method of keeping track.  If you have a fairly long-term announcement though, email me (lxndrc@gmail.com) and I'll add it here.<br/>
<br/>
Changes to the mailing list only occur via email to lxndrc@gmail.com.  Telling Lxndr in IRC or the Foundry will not result in changes to the newsletter.  Please, if you notice a game that you know to have moved or ended, or if you know of a game that is happening that isn't on this list, send a notification via email.<br/>
<br/>
GAMES PEOPLE WANT TO START<br/>
<br/>
Give me your name or preferred alias, a time (with time zone), a short blurb on what game you're interested in arranging, and I'll assume you're intending to take the GM-role if one exists and you don't specify otherwise.<br/>
