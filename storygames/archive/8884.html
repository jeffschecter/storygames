The character had found the faith and come west, leaving his mother behind.<br/><br/>He'd brought his past into a conflict when dealing with a guy who was shamed because in order to save the family farm his wife had to sleep with miners for money. The guy was angry and the guy says something like, "That's only because you were jealous. I don't know if it was of attention, or because you wanted to lie with your mother yourself, but you were jealous of those man and all your faith is just based on running away from the problem like a coward."<br/><br/>So, you wanna take the blow and admit that you abandoned your mother because you wanted to fuck her?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196453/#Comment_196453" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-10T14:24:57+00:00" title="March 10, 2009  2:24PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Colin,<br/>\n  Well, it is really too easy, you just have to question their authority.

The two complaints that new players keep having about <i>Dogs</i> is "all my Dogs do is talk" and "all my Dogs do is kill", and while the latter is the one you've seen, the former is what was plaguing parties to the previous discussion.  (A corollary to "all they do is talk": "Why are d4s/fallout so bad?")  I figured I'd open up a discussion of making verbal conflicts that really hurt so that we can help people who have three different issues:<br/><br/> 1) "The PCs don't feel like it's a big deal to Take the Blow, or even give, when we're just talking."<br/> 2) "The PCs never choose to escalate to violence."<br/> 2) "The PCs don't feel like making GM characters Take the Blow from talking is effective, so they always go for their guns."<br/><br/>I feel like all three of these make <i>Dogs</i> less fun than it should be.  So I'd like to help build a toolkit for players and GMs to make sure that conflict counts at every level of escalation, primarily by helping them think of really painful raises (and creative ways to see) for the first level.<br/><br/>That said, I agree wholeheartedly with your point that good raises are about questioning the Dogs' authority.  How have you done that in a way that really stings?  It's one thing to say "Oh yeah, mumble, he questions your authority."  It's something else to say, in character, "[see] Brother Malachi, I ain't the one with a mile-long trail of tombstones behind me.  [raise] Murder follows you like a chick follows a hen.  You ain't right with the King, and you ain't right with me or with no man."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196480/#Comment_196480" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-10T17:01:17+00:00" title="March 10, 2009  5:01PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually that post clarified the connection between the rest of the ideas in the thread, maybe I was a bit dim but I didn't get it until now, kudos to you for that.<br/><br/>I think in addition to just having more strident fallout, you could have the admission spread beyond the confines of the conflict (which is kind of what taking the blow does in physical confrontations too).

I direct verbal raises against him to the audience rather than directly to him ("Damned right I'm calling you a jealous sinner, right here, to your face, in front of the King and these here good folks."), which causes a chink in the armor when he Takes the Blow (temp trait "There are doubts about my Stewardship 1d4").  Once you've got that, you get a crowbar into that chink in later conflicts: "We wouldn't even be talking right now if you wasn't set on taking the gold for yourself.  Brother Luke was right, what makes you a Dog is that you're a greedy son of a bitch!"<br/><br/>Maybe I threaten someone else instead.  The Dog can't be hurt by what I say to him, but he knows someone else could be vulnerable.  "Maybe I can't beat no sense into your head, but I reckon that old grandpa of yours ain't so stubborn."<br/><br/>Maybe instead (this was suggested by Adam, above) the conflict between the Dog and the GM character is verbal, but there's another conflict going on that has already escalated \u2014 a hostage situation, say.  The sorcerer is holding a screaming little girl, a knife to her throat.  It hardly matters what he says, as long as the next thing narrated is "...and a fresh trickle of blood starts down her neck."  Blows Taken, or giving, in the talking conflict may equate to harm, maybe mortal harm, being done to characters not party to the rules-mediated conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196778/#Comment_196778" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-13T04:40:12+00:00" title="March 13, 2009  4:40AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, insult Kane and he is impassive, reduce a weak 3rd party to tears with verbal abuse and he acts.
