However, it got better and better after that.<br/><br/>The way you handle spirits and magic is really beautiful. I'll be stealing some of the magic stuff for some of my own hacks! Very nicely done.<br/><br/>The GM guide also has some fantastic advice in it. I like that!<br/><br/>(Also, if you're worried about that kind of thing, you have a lot of typos/minor errors.

Here's some feedback. Assume that if I don't say anything about it, I liked a lot. I reserve comments for things I LOVE or things I'm concerned about. (And there's a lot to LOVE in this system!)<br/><br/>Re-allocating stats each season change: Love it. Your flavor explanation is perfect, too.<br/><br/>Always succeeding on a career roll: This I'm concerned about. Failure is extremely important in Dungeon World based systems, as it pushes the story forward like nothing else, and a good DM is capable of using failure to excite and to escalate. <br/><br/>I don't think it's too big a deal, though - hence mere concern and not dislike - because it does come with a "harder complication or cost". Perhaps just being explicit that, compensation for the automatic 7-9, the "harder complication or cost" translates to the fact the GM is allowed to automatically make a move in response to their success, as opposed to a normal success, where they just present you with a choice or complication.<br/><br/>Examples of allies: In the parenthetical examples, you forgot to say "etc.". You'd be surprised how many people assume those are the only options.<br/><br/>Patterns: So casting patterns through writing runes requires dexterity but not eerieness? I'm not sure I understand - someone who's not eerie at all can still rune-pattern, as long as they're dextrous? Or do you mean they roll dexterity <i>in addition </i> to rolling eerieness? What if it was "roll + dexterity or eerieness, whichever's lower"? <br/><br/>Spinning Patterns Backwards: You can spin Closing backwards. Can you spin any other Song backwards, or just Closing? <br/><br/>Fate and Transcendence: These seem vague and powerful. Fate is seeing the future and messing with it? And Transcendence is erratic shapeshifting of others?<br/><br/>Fate seems poorly described, and Transcendence seems really strong. <br/><br/>Perhaps Transcendence could just be replaced with 'shapeshifting other people temporarily' to serve as a counterpart to Shifting.<br/><br/>Overall: Excellent. I truly loved it. Look forward to seeing more of your stuff!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cuchulainn" title="Cuchulainn"><img alt="Cuchulainn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cuchulainn">Cuchulainn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442913/#Comment_442913" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-15T21:08:48+00:00" title="February 15, 2015  9:08PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul_T: thank you! I'd like to fix the typos eventually, but english is not my first language and it takes me double effort to notice them. <br/><br/>BeePeeGee: feel free to do it, and please be sure to tell me how it worked<br/><br/>Inanimate: So it was you who wrote in that /tg/ thread! i could'nt answer because it 404d<br/><br/>On your concerns: the "succeed even on a miss" in your careers, is something reworked from World of Dungeons (when you never failed if you had a relevant skill). Its one of my main concerns when playtesting the whole thing<br/><br/>I'll take the "etcs" into account, thanks! on Dexterity being used to cast patterns: i think i'm keeping the "roll + dexterity or eerieness, whichever's lower" thing.<br/><br/>Spinning Patterns Backwards: You're right on this. Maybe i'll just add the pattern section that some patterns can be spun backwards; and leave them on the GM's fiat to decide which ones.<br/><br/>Fate: this pattern is poorly explained. I intended for it to be a kind of "bless" or "curse". You don't necessarily read the target's fate (that would maybe require having a clairvoyancy-related career). The pattern just inscribes a line on fate: "You'll be a king someday". "You'll face an horrible death"; and GM has to accomplish that prophecy to the best of his skills. Of course, failing a roll can bring you troubles, more likely to be proportional as your blessing/curse.<br/><br/>Trascendency: You're right; this is really powerful. But it appears on the Loom videogame; a main inspiration of this game. Maybe i'm just curious about what can happen if you give a character that much ability. And of course, the bigger the power, the bigger the risks. Also, trascendency is not equal to death. The target just shifts into a trascended form (and this is so open that it can mean whatever a GM wants to mean)<br/><br/>I'll take all your critics into account for the final draft. I didn't expected so good reviews! i'm really glad someone liked it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Inanimate" title="Inanimate"><img alt="Inanimate" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/975/nEQWQKRE3OJ64.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Inanimate">Inanimate</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442920/#Comment_442920" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-15T23:27:19+00:00" title="February 15, 2015 11:27PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, yeah, Fate with that description makes a lot more sense. I actually like it - there's gonna be a lot of creative manipulation of how the prophecy could come to be. "You'll face a horrible death" - not necessarily your own!<br/><br/>Transcendence still worries me, but I see what you mean. I'd recommend you provide more guidelines for the GM on how to deal with it.<br/><br/>And no problem man! I love the system, and your other ones too. Best of luck in playtesting it.
