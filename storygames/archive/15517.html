The game went well, but that's not why I'm posting. There came the moment when I told them that I didn't have anything prepared, that we were going to come up with it here and now. Their eyes shined, and we were off.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to organize a public space for introducing people to GM-full games that are filled to the brim with these sort of experiences: Microscope, Fiasco, Polaris, etc. I know Ben Robbins has been doing this sort of thing in Seattle, but I'd like to openly ask you:<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you organized an open story game street team?<br/>\nWhat did you do to publicize it?<br/>\nWhat kind of facilitation and leadership do you bring to the event? <br/>\nWhat else should I, and anyone interested in doing something similar, know before diving it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352628/#Comment_352628" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-28T11:03:47+00:00" title="December 28, 2011 11:03AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Indeed I have been doing this sort of thing in Seattle.

Apparently what we need is a Bellingham meetup group so we get that solid, I-5 PNW action. <br/><br/>Ethan, you should check out cons in your area and advertise a bit on here and rpg.net. I had never heard of meetup.com until I saw it on a flyer, but now I think it is a great platform. Also, you'd be surprised at how many people who have never played rpg's can get into Story Games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353121/#Comment_353121" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-04T10:46:44+00:00" title="January  4, 2012 10:46AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nathan Paoletta, Dev Purkayastha, and I started SG Boston in 2006-2007, running random pick-up games every week. The number of participants varied from 4-25, slowly increasing over time, but it eventually settled into a fairly stable group of a dozen regulars before I left to move to Seattle.  That was cool, but it kinda subverted the original plan of playing a lot of different games with a lot of different people.  SG Boston is still cruising along, so I hear, but I really have no idea what they're up to these days.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
