I'm quite a fan of Kingmaker.  You play as factions of Barons in the War of the Roses.  You build up armies, take castles, and try to crown your candidate for King (or Queen Regent) of England.  The game can get bogged down when one player has an overwhelming preponderance of force, so there is an event deck full of peasant rebellions, Scots raids, and French invasions.  These call individual nobles away from the warhost to deal with problems in their individual domains.  This works well, because the most powerful factions will tend to have lots and lots of nobles, and so a higher chance of getting messed up by the event deck.<br/><br/>I think random events should be of this type: they introduce complications and new obstacles to a plan that otherwise has every chance of success.  I'm not such a fan of Random Encounter Tables, particularly when you slavishly roll a % die every hour to determine whether you need to roll for an encounter...  Twenty dice later, "You see a squirrel.  He's eating nuts.  With his mate, a dragon."  Sigh.  I think it's much better for the DM to use his or her discretion.  If the game is moving slowly, or the pcs seem overconfident, it's high time that they are "randomly" "encountered" by something scary.  Or if they've just been to town and have new equipment, which you know the story won't give them a chance to use soon (short of butchering your friendly NPC, one of the most dangerous jobs in a campaign), maybe they should be "randomly" ambushed by low-level bandits.  Other than that, it slows down the game and the story.  That being said, it's perfectly fair for the DM to PRETEND there are really random encounters.  For this purpose, whenever I DM I'm constantly rolling dice and glancing at notes, making noises like "Hmm." or "Lucky you."  It keeps the players on their toes and disrupts meta-game thinking.  I also call for spot checks when I know there's nothing to spot, but I imagine the PCs ought to be feeling paranoid.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230467/#Comment_230467" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-07T20:43:53+00:00" title="September  7, 2009  8:43PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            *Headscratch*<br/><br/>I've got a thing I'm working on that's...   well, basically, a print-and-play island management board game.

If the GM feels like spicing things up, they can make a tens-and-ones roll with two six-sided dice (producing one of 36 results numbered 11 to 66). "Ninjas attack the mansion!"  "There's a sudden rainstorm and all the maids get wet!" "The Master promised to give the maids away while gambling! Now they have to find a way to win them back!" The players can also spend Favor points (the game's drama points, but gained by pleasing the Master) to get a random event. Maid RPG supports running actual adventures/scenarios (usually by turning off the random event option), but it has a "random-event driven" play mode where you just start with a typical day at the mansion and then heap on random events until the game shambles to some kind of climax. It gives the game even more of a manic, zany feel, which is saying something.<br/><br/>I don't know of many RPGs that use something similar. Toon has some similar tables in the back, though they're just for the GM (Animator) to use if things are getting slow.<br/><br/>There's kind of a parallel with the In A Wicked Age's oracles, but those come exclusively at the beginning of each chapter, and constitute the seeds of the basic situation and all of the characters within it.<br/><br/>There's a Japanese RPG called Meikyuu Kingdom. It takes place in a world that is nothing but dungeons, and you play the leaders of a small (70 or so people) kingdom carved out of the dungeon/landscape. In each session you clear out dungeon rooms, which you can then use to expand your kingdom. Before you embark on a journey, and when you take rests between dungeon rooms, there are random event tables to roll on that can affect your kingdom's fates, and players get to pick which of a set of four tables to roll on.<br/><br/>One of these days I need to dust it off, but I had started on a game called "Dandelion Complex," which takes place in a Japanese high school classroom, but is in reality nothing more than a vehicle for random events.<br/><br/>That's all I can think of off the top of my head.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlexS" title="AlexS"><img alt="AlexS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img222.imageshack.us/img222/4284/as32px.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlexS">AlexS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230536/#Comment_230536" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T07:54:10+00:00" title="September  8, 2009  7:54AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 8, 2009 7:54AM by AlexS.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://dsg.neko-machi.com/hikikomori.pdf" rel="nofollow">Hikikomori</a> works by randomly introducing events each day of the life of the protagonist.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230557/#Comment_230557" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T09:09:06+00:00" title="September  8, 2009  9:09AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How to Host a Dungeon makes a lot of use of random tables to drive gameplay.

Game usually lasts for an hour to three. This is sort of the default playstyle. At least, IMO anyway.<br/>2) "Favor Race": GM starts a "day in the life" where the maids cook and clean and stuff - and interject random events into the game to spice it up, usually from the beginning.<br/><br/>So, in the above two types of play, the game isn't JUST about random events. You're actually doing stuff in kind of a classic scenario/adventure format. However, the players can (and should) interject with the random events by spending the favor, just as Ewen mentions above.<br/><br/>The last playstyle:<br/>3) "Totally Nutso Random". This is the beer and pretzels game, lasts 15 minutes to an hour or so. Basically the game is *nothing* but random rolls by the GM to start and drive the action. They're fun, wild, but tend to run out of steam fast. It's actually less recommended for players to use their power to create random events in this kind of play - at least be careful with that power - because too many random things happening at once (1-2 plot threads) and things get confusing.<br/><br/>So, just to correct and inform: Maid isn't just about total random event-driven play. In fact, it's mostly scenario based, with the unique conceit being that the Players, not the GM, fire off the random event rolls.<br/><br/>Also, there's a bunch of such D66 tables: There were three in the basic book (modern, fantasy, SF). In a later supplement, which we included in the core book, there are tables for setting (fantasy, cyberpunk, post apoc, elizabethan, western, modern, etc) as well as genre (action, dark, light, romance, hard life, etc). That was kind of cool, I thought; to have tables not just for the actual setting, but for the mood of the game as well.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230567/#Comment_230567" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T09:46:27+00:00" title="September  8, 2009  9:46AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have a look at <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=3&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfmeme.com%2Fbacchanal.html&amp;ei=pIqmSqyrOtKZjAeQ--iyCA&amp;usg=AFQjCNFlK-5ac9G__VlFKRZFf3DFwlZd-A&amp;sig2=BD5FDReE9p6cXwvdrZk7Fw" rel="nofollow">Bacchanal</a>.

But for example F.E.A.R., one of the major publishers, typically includes "D66 R.O.C." ("Roll Or Choose") tables for stuff like character backgrounds in most of their games. The aforementioned Meikyuu Kingdom has some randomness in character creation in that your character has random likes and dislikes (roll up four things, assign two each to likes and dislikes how you wish), and starts with a random relationship with one of the other PCs. If I go through my collection I'm sure I could come up with a couple more examples.<br/><br/>Random tables are definitely more common in Japanese RPGs than Western ones, but Maid RPG is practically an exercise in maximizing the use of randomness in general (there are very few ways to engage the mechanics at all that don't involve rolling dice!) and not really representative per se.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
