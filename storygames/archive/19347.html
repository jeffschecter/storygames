The interplay of Persona, Wises, Nature and the other stats (you can use half your stat unless you have a skill in it, but you can tag your Nature or use your Wise...). I'm still working at it, because damned if I'll let a gaming system defeat me. I'll surely curse my own stupidity when it finally clicks.<br/><br/>That said, I can't help but think to my current favorite system (Powered by the Apocalypse); how feasible/difficult would it be to make a Torchbearer hack? I can see keeping the Conditions-as-HP, the limited carrying capacity and the scene/action-based time-keeping. Would that even work? Would the freeform nature of *World be able to replicate the very strict game of attrition, opportunity cost and risk-reward?<br/><br/>(*if I ever get to run a Torchbearer game, it would probably be set in the Darksouls universe)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430754/#Comment_430754" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-09T15:33:11+00:00" title="April  9, 2014  3:33PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an interesting question. I think you could do Torchbearer Lite by leveraging a lot of the *World mechanics. But the game is ridiculously tight, and filled with mechanical hooks all over the place. But I think it's possible. Off the cuff...<br/><br/>"Tell them to mark off a condition" is an obvious hard move. The conditions themselves are less obvious, because of how they tie into a lot of the mechanical hooks in Torchbearer, hooks that don't exist in a *World game. They give small penalties, small bonuses, work into the conflict disposition, the helping rules, Wises, etc. But they're necessary, and they're part of the ongoing pressure.<br/><br/>The Grind is fairly easy to play out: it even follows the typical Countdown structure. You just leverage it whenever someone makes a move.<br/><br/>The cycle of resources is a big extra pressure. You'd need a good way to replicate that.<br/><br/>Inventory is easy enough, just port the slots system right over. It's simple to fit in.<br/><br/>The biggest problem, though, is that characters advance in Torchbearer: they slowly advance their skills and other resources by using them in risky ways. You can't emulate that very well in *World games, which are about increasing your options in a situation. Nothing ever makes those options substantially <i>better</i>, as in raising them beyond the 10+/7-9/6- scatter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430755/#Comment_430755" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-09T15:38:52+00:00" title="April  9, 2014  3:38PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, why not?<br/><br/>The main problems I would see would be that the existing *W mechanics have problems dealing with:<br/><br/>* Incremental actions (good move design tends to resolve conflicts and develop new situations quickly)<br/>* Situational modifiers (these are not easy in a system where only the players roll and middle outcomes are preferred)<br/>* Timing issues (different moves tend to imply different time-scales, which makes it hard to handle actions in a "1 per round"-type system<br/><br/>Assuming you're willing to jettison the basic concept of the "AW conversation" (player moves alternating with MC moves), there's no reason you couldn't design your own moves which are appropriate to a Torchbearer-esque style of play.

Maybe being Angry causes you to hold 1 fewer than you would with moves. (e.g., if you hold 3 from a move that lets you examine the room, you hold 2 instead.) Then, moves that focus on preparation and caution would give you hold. Being Angry would push you towards more impulsive, risky actions that don't require hold.<br/><br/>Hm.

I don't have much to show off yet.<br/><br/>Here's my current approach. <i>Apocalypse World</i> treats the conversation as continuous, to be interrupted occasionally by moves. Compare that to <i>Sundered Land</i> games. They each have their own conversation and their own procedures, and if you want continuity, you have to string them together by reusing fictional elements from one game in another.<br/><br/>I'm treating those as two reference points on a spectrum. Somewhere between them, there's the idea of subsystems that work like nested moves. Instead of nanogames, mega-moves. For example, right now I've got a parley system which starts with "When you converse with another character, you can enter a parley," and continues, "As long as you parley, you can avail yourself of the parley moves." The parley moves (<i>read a person</i> and <i>seduce or manipulate</i>, basically) can be invoked when you're in parley and only when you're in parley. There are also a very few basic moves that span subsystems.<br/><br/>(AW's special combat moves work kind of like this, too!)<br/><br/>I definitely want to hit the danger-heavy dungeon crawl feel that Torchbearer strives for. I haven't quite gotten there yet. I've got parley and hexcrawling ready to playtest, but none of the rest yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430761/#Comment_430761" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-09T16:36:12+00:00" title="April  9, 2014  4:36PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If anyone wants to compare notes and/or brainstorm on this, I'd be game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430762/#Comment_430762" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-09T17:50:44+00:00" title="April  9, 2014  5:50PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, please!

It has some basic moves that include an "act under fire" type general move, a helping/hindering move, and harm. I also have a Parley minigame, and a Travel minigame. (I've tied experience directly into helping/hindering and Parley, to encourage ~drama in the depths~.)<br/><br/>I'm envisioning a Delve minigame, and a Skirmish minigame.<br/><br/>The Delve minigame would be my answer to the Grind. Procedurally, it involves the PCs proceeding slowly into an area, evaluating the opportunities and dangers in a place, interacting with those, and then moving on\u2014lather, rinse, repeat until you wind up in a Skirmish or something else. Time, light, and stamina are the depleting resources.<br/><br/>In particular, a lot of what you're doing is spending time to ask more questions. This is what you do in a dungeon instead of <i>reading a sitch</i> in every room. You're going over everything with a fine toothed comb, and asking after treasure, traps, hazards, secret doors, etc. The longer you spend looking things over, the more questions you can ask. But the more time you lose, and the more opportunities the MC to set up badness and follow through.<br/><br/>Since the Delve is a minigame unto itself, we could say that it has its own moves. And we could have it that <i>those</i> moves deplete time in increments, but non-Delve moves don't. That lets us control the countdown aspect of the Grind a little better.<br/><br/>Does this sound plausible?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430766/#Comment_430766" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-09T18:39:55+00:00" title="April  9, 2014  6:39PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 9, 2014 6:42PM by Paul_T.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It does. The basic idea is quite sound, and a nice nod to the Torchbearer mechanics.<br/><br/>The main issue with *world-style moves for dungeon crawling is that making things like running out of ammo or torches or time dependent on a die roll (a move which uses one, in other words) means you can't estimate your resources or your risk as easily. There's more guesswork and less certainty. <br/><br/>This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but may frustrate players looking for a way to find an edge. I like the idea of building certainty into it via moves. For instance, you could have something like:<br/><br/>"Search Room" - <br/>[list of questions]<br/>On a 10+, ask 3 questions. On a 7-9, ask one question. On a 6-, MC makes a move, likely a roll for wandering monsters.<br/><br/>This shows how effective your initial look over the room is: what do your keen senses and experience help you pick up right away?<br/><br/>After this roll, you may keep searching, more carefully: you may ask as many additional questions as you like, but each one increments the Time counter by 1.<br/><br/>(In my own thought experiment, which I'm fooling around with at home, I have a simpler version which is: 10+ you find it quickly, 7-9 you don't find it yet, but you can spend extra time to find it [or roll again with a bonus], 6 or less, you don't find it.

Other people have said this, but part of why Torchbearer works is because it's so, so finely tuned. <br/><br/>It works because the way you get better in Wheel games, it works because of The Grind, it works because the game is tightly tied to putting overmatched characters in situations where the sense of risk is balanced against their ability to assess and work the dungeon. All the little mechanics add up and work together. <br/><br/>Especially if the impetus for this is: "I don't really get/like the Mouse Guard system" (which is fine!), then you shouldn't be trying to replicate that, making mini-game adaptations of another system seems like the wrong way about.<br/><br/>If you're instead like: "Okay, I want to make a game about heroes before they were heroes, when they had to scrabble for every last copper." and then work out from there, I think you'll find something more organic. Maybe some of those inspirations will be similar. But I'd start more from that premise and "what do you want to do" rather than "how do I port Torchbearer"?<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d" title="Archangel3d"><img alt="Archangel3d" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nHJSFRW82OXJ8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d">Archangel3d</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430796/#Comment_430796" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-10T07:43:35+00:00" title="April 10, 2014  7:43AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fair enough.

I'm re-reading the rules again (with the sheet handy this time) and it feels like <i>everything</i> has the potential to be 'hitpoints'. It reminds me of a lot of cooperative boardgames like Red November or Forbidden Desert; If X reaches 0 you lose, if Y reaches 0 you lose, if you have too much Z you lose. But sometimes regaining X costs you Y, and sometimes getting rid of Z will lose X as well. In these kinds of games, you have to keep a dozen plates spinning, watching for the one that's most wobbly. <br/><br/>Similarly, in TB, each resource is a spinning plate that you have to maintain, often risking another resource in the process. You've got Light, Resources, Items, Skills, Circles, Conditions, Nature and a bunch of others (Fate? I'm not there yet in the rules) that all interact on some level, and they all push and pull against each other. That's the reason the game has so many cogs; they are all needed to interact.<br/><br/>On the other hand, *World has very few cogs. To do an 'inspired by Torchbearer', the hack would need extra resources that can be gained and depleted. Fitting that into a *World framework would be a an important step, and not an easy one (since, as designed, *World eschews tracking many resources). However, they would not necessarily need to be the same distribution or concept as the TB resources. For example, each Condition could have a clock rather than an on-off state, or the Moves themselves could 'deteriorate'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430830/#Comment_430830" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-10T19:21:43+00:00" title="April 10, 2014  7:21PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bingo!

(Use the same for light sources, too! And when you don't have a light source, it means that you can't do certain things which require light.) Write the moves so that it makes sense for turns to be consumed by them.

One cleaves more closely to AW, the other more closely to <i>Torchbearer</i>. The viability of either of these systems depends on having really good dungeon-delving moves, which I don't have yet (and am happy to take suggestions for).<br/><br/>Solution <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> is dead simple and should do the trick, but it's very abstract. It uses <i>Apocalypse World</i>'s base harm mechanic (or you can use AWDA's Fates), and the countdown clock. Grind is like a player-facing countdown clock. You have a number of dungeon exploration moves, and they all say something like, "take 1 turn to..." and end with "Mark 1 Grind." One of the moves is "Take a break," which lets you take a turn and clear your Grind. When you mark 6 Grind (or 4 Grind or however you want to do it), clear your Grind and take 1 harm (ap). This is compatible with the usual harm rules for weapons, armour, gangs and the like.<br/><br/>Solution <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> uses Conditions \xe0 la <i>Torchbearer</i>. The way I'd do it is, you have the following conditions:\n<ol><li><i>Tired</i>. You can move quickly, or quietly, but not both. If you're encumbered, you can't do either.</li>\n<li><i>Angry</i>. Take -1 ongoing.</li>\n<li><i>Panicked</i>. If you want to do anything other than shaking, it's <i>acting under fire</i> (and the fire is, you just stand there shaking)</li>\n<li><i>Cursed</i>. You can't benefit from another PC's <i>aid</i>.</li>\n<li><i>Wounded</i>. You can't <i>aid or interfere</i> with another PC.</li>\n<li><i>Sick</i>. You have six days to get better or you're <i>dead</i>.</li>\n<li><i>Dead</i>.</li></ol>\nYou have a number of dungeon exploration moves, and they all say something like, "take 1 turn to..." and end with "Mark 1 Grind." When you mark 6 Grind (or 4 Grind or however you want to do it), clear your Grind and take a Condition in this order:<br/><br/><i>tired</i> &gt; <i>angry</i> &gt; <i>sick</i> &gt; <i>panicked</i> &gt; <i>dead</i><br/><br/>I'm using fewer conditions for the Grind but you contract them a little more slowly, 1 per hour maybe, instead of 1 per 40 mins. This is an easy dial to turn.<br/><br/>One of the moves is "Take a break," which lets you take a turn, clear your Grind, and remove the Tired condition.<br/><br/>You might also have one or more <i>fresh</i> boxes, which you can mark instead of taking a Condition. Or cheats and compromises, like, instead of marking a Condition, you can pick "you leave something behind, or take something with you" Kind of like hit points? Maybe?<br/><br/>The MC also has a new move, "Apply a Condition as established." This is the main way to get <i>cursed</i> or <i>sick</i>, or <i>wounded</i> (eg. in skirmish, or whiffing an <i>act under fire</i> roll when physical danger is involved, and so on). For example, you might have an accident in which you're <i>wounded</i>, and then when you wade through muddy water I might say there's a risk it gets infected (ie., you get <i>sick</i>), or what have you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431028/#Comment_431028" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-15T12:13:14+00:00" title="April 15, 2014 12:13PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, I have a thought on <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>. I haven't actually read Apocalypse World (I know! Shame on me!), but <i>Monster of the Week</i> has "harm moves" that the Keeper can trigger when someone takes harm. The harm moves get more severe as the Hunter checks off more harm boxes. (So a 0-harm move might be "fall prone", while a 4-harm move might be "fall unconscious".)<br/><br/>So whenever the Grind hits, and you mark off a Harm segment, maybe the Dungeon Master can dictate a harm move. Maybe assigning a "condition" <i>is</i> a Harm move. So you'd keep a list of conditions, and when a player takes a point of Harm, give them a condition that goes with their current level of Harm, or lower.<br/><br/>Another option: use the Dark Age style of crossing out Fates, but word it rules-specific like you suggested earlier.

Instead, perhaps looking at the raison-d'\xeatre of the Conditions would bring fruit. I know this will sound very rambling, but bear with me (I'm mentally working through this myself as I write). <br/><br/>Ultimately, Torchbearer is about penalties and bonuses. You use Wises, help and items to allow you to roll more dice. Environmental issues (light, weather, etc) reduce your number of dice. Some aspects of the rules allow you to reroll dice, other aspects of the game grant more dice to your opponent (who are opposing your own dice). And Conditions both remove dice or remove your ability to add dice. And all those bonuses and penalties add up to a single roll.<br/><br/>The purpose of Conditions, mechanically, is to have a gradual reduction of effectiveness and options. The options that it removes are not ways to achieve success, but rather ways to improve your chance at success. Moreover, Conditions are a test-your-luck mechanic. This is important. Having a few does not guarantee failure, and you don't always earn them in any specific order. Since the game has so many moving pieces, Conditions can rattle a few of those pieces without being crippling (usually) until they get overwhelming.<br/><br/>Personally, I feel that's pretty core to the experience; simulating the overall exhaustion from being in such a dangerous, hostile environment. They should feel like limitations of your body and spirit, and you can try to push beyond those limits. Using the specific Conditions as emotional or physical on/off switches is just the way the game seeks to simulate that exhaustion.<br/><br/>The question then becomes; are there other ways to simulate the grinding, decaying effectiveness in a *World game without creating Torchbearer Condition analogues?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431573/#Comment_431573" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-24T22:12:26+00:00" title="April 24, 2014 10:12PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2014 10:12PM by creases.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I came to some similar conclusions after tinkering for a couple of weeks.

The first is for you to do something, the second is when something is done to you (there are also Make Camp and Return to Town moves).  Instead of stats players have energy tokens they can add to their rolls.  You start with six and can add as many as you like to any roll.  When you lose them, they don't come back until you make camp.  These function as your health/condition track, as you get less effective the fewer of them you have.  Also, the GM might grab one from you as the result of a hard move.  At zero, you die.<br/><br/>Conditions and tools are factored in as +1 or -1 bonuses.  If you're trying to climb a slippery rock and you have a rope - hooray +1.  If you don't have a rope and you're missing a torch - ugh -1.  If you don't have a torch and you have a broken leg - minus two, sucker.  Yeah, it's brutal.<br/><br/>I've playtested it a few times and its getting close to what I like - a bunch of in over their head peasants on a horrible slog towards death.  And who doesn't love that?<br/><br/>I can share the documents if there's interest (although I am seriously thinking of borrowing those downgraded moves from Black Stars Rise!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d" title="Archangel3d"><img alt="Archangel3d" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nHJSFRW82OXJ8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d">Archangel3d</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431654/#Comment_431654" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-26T07:56:37+00:00" title="April 26, 2014  7:56AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd be super interested to check them out, Keith!<br/><br/>That minimalist energy mechanic sounds like a great solution to the 'grind' feel. Could I suggest that when you make camp, you regain all your energy BUT your max energy is reduced by 1? Making camp in a dungeon is not super restful; it's painful, uncomfortable and stressful (what's that sound?). You'd gain back some energy, but it would wear on you to do it too often. You would only go back up to your max energy by sleeping in an inn. Having a diminishing return on camping would prevent 'camp spamming', and would make for a much more difficult risk-reward decision.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431655/#Comment_431655" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-26T08:06:34+00:00" title="April 26, 2014  8:06AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm.

Very nicely done! Reminds me a bit of Ghost Lines, in a way.<br/><br/>My only qualm in running this game would be in terms of GM calls: when do you take away someone's energy, which moves do you make when, etc. Let's say that ogre hits the villager: what should the consequences be? It would be nice to have an appropriate default. (Remove one energy token seems reasonable, although perhaps too light.) This would be a requirement for this game to work, I think.<br/><br/>Do you see "instant death" types of situations happening in this game, or for everything to work as a chipping away of a limited number of tokens?<br/><br/>(I would also call "energy tokens" Vigor or something like that, but that's just me...)<br/><br/>I feel like it might be nice to have some kind of character traits in play as well. For some reason, I'd think of the villagers in a certain town as all having stereotypical reputations: he's the strong but dumb one, he's the one who's always daydreaming, animals always seem to like her and listen to her, stuff like that. <br/><br/>Not sure what the best way to bring that into play would be: maybe it would just be treated as a "tool" ("I'm going to use my strength as a tool to open this rusty gate") or maybe it would interact with the energy token economy somehow (you could "exhaust" the trait to get a +1, perhaps, or maybe spending an energy token when your trait applies gives you a +2 instead of a +1).<br/><br/>I'm hesitant to add anything to such an elegant game, but there's something very village-y about being able to say that this character is the <i>burly beekeeper</i> and that one is the <i>sweet-talking butcher</i>.<br/><br/><br/>Edit: A couple more things.<br/><br/>First, the "trouble" words could potentially throw up some not-so-inspiring combinations due to redundancy in the lists. For example, you could easily draw "Winter, Summer, Fall" or a similar uninspiring combination. I don't know if this bothers you, of course, but I think it's worth thinking about.<br/><br/>Second, the whole premise here is "Underground: Where We Do Not Belong", but most of those Trouble words aren't likely to create anything underground or dungeonesque. Is that a disconnect in the design, or intentional? For example, if we draw "Excess, Family, Mayor", I doubt we're going to see torches in a dank dungeon, at least not as the first (or second, or third) thing that comes to mind. What's the intent of the game here?<br/><br/>Third, what font is that (titles)? I like it a lot!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431726/#Comment_431726" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-27T23:37:19+00:00" title="April 27, 2014 11:37PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/creases">@creases</a>,<br/><br/>I love the idea of inventing your own "demi-humans" each time you play.

I know there are things I am doing when I run it that need to be codified and written down.  I just need to figure out what those things are!<br/><br/>I haven't had any instant death situations yet.  People tend to jealously horde their tokens and only use them when they really, really want to succeed.  Usually about half the party dies, starting with the first death around half way through.<br/><br/>Adjectives could be interesting to add to the professional nouns.  That's a bit of what I was trying to get at with the memories from the village bit.<br/><br/>"Winter, Summer, Fall" would potentially be a dull combination.  My mind goes to a witch who has hexed the town into a perpetual winter.  But if a group were uninspired, I suppose they could draw again.  Other than season words, do you see anything that looks like a pitfall?<br/><br/>I agree that the players are unlikely to go underground.  As I was making the professions as realistic as I could I realized that stereotypical villagers would face very few perils emerging from the underground, even in a fantasy setting.  But, I do like the idea of caverns because they close the party off from so many pleasant things: sun, air, aid.  But then on the other hand, I've loved the troubles that have arisen from the word list.  I'm sort of at an impasse as far as that goes.  I have been brainstorming alternate titles, though, so that might tell me which way I'm leaning towards.<br/><br/>And... font! <a href="http://www.dafont.com/benjamin-franklin.font" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dafont.com/benjamin-franklin.font</a><br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">@James_Stuart</a><br/><br/>Expending energy pre-roll is brutal!  But brutal is what I'm going for.  I think you're idea of spending one token permanently might be a fair trade to move up a category - even without temporarily spending half your stash.<br/><br/>EDIT: I remember the other thought - I am considering further splintering the dice results, so as to make spending energy (or vigor or whatever better name I come up with) more worthwhile.  Maybe 5-, 6-7, 8-9, 10+, but I'm not sure what that extra middle result would be.  Maybe for Endure Hardship 6-7 would be lose an energy whereas 8-9 would be gain a condition. Now I'm rambling...<br/><br/>Anyway, thanks for the feedback!  I'm going to try to make the GM section clearer and then if anyone else would like to run it, I'd be much obliged.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
