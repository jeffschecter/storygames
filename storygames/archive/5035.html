So play would go something like this:<br/>* Mini-GM frames a scene which is "pregnant" with morally vague "hooks".<br/>* Each little buddy writes down an agenda for the protagonist, placing it face down. This agenda will be tthe outcome of a course of action that the individual buddies want the protag to follow.<br/>* In turn, each buddy presents an argument in favor of a course of action (NOT in favor of the hidden agenda). The protag can respond, even question or berate the buddies.<br/>* Eventually, the protag takes a course of action that aligns with one of the buddies: flip that agenda over to see the outcome.<br/>* The "winning" buddy then become the mini-GM and riffs off that outcome to build the next scene/decision point. The previous mini-GM becomes whatever buddy that person was (angel or devil) and we return to the beginning of the cycle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113516/#Comment_113516" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-11T08:30:39+00:00" title="December 11, 2007  8:30AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not even really much of a hack for Polaris.

In the Drifter's Escape, one is Conformity and one is ebellion, neither of which is completely good or bad.  That leaves the Drifter/primary protagonist a chance to make actual choices.  If one outside influence is the angel on his shoulder, it is too easy to choose that path every time.  That is why they suggested obscuring who is who, I think, as that leaves the Protagonist some sort of choice.  But that choice is pretty limited and false (being based on illusion and lack of information).  Better to have the two forces represent incomplete moral frameworks that are right some of the time and wrong some of the time, so the protagonist can make genuine moral decisions - including occasionally rejecting both.<br/><br/><br/>(I've been thinking about <a href="http://mrteapot.livejournal.com/51319.html" rel="nofollow">this same sort of setup</a> for the Festival of Flawless Victory.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
