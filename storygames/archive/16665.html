This concerns me, as I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about the actions people need to make in order to play specific games, and the costs of engaging with mechanics.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn short, I there is a cost to engaging with mechanics. It requires you to mentally shift gears from fictional simulation to mechanical simulation and that can cause problems with the shared imaginary space if it happens too often. If one of your the goals at your table is to create fiction that remains consistent within the heads of all participants, then you end up in a situation where the benefits of engaging a particular mechanic must outweigh the costs of doing so.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember Vincent Bakers awesome diagrams about <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.lumpley.com/archive/156.html" rel="nofollow">clouds and boxes</a>? It\u2019s right here. I\u2019m going to use his terminology so you may want to pop that open in order to refresh your memory.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people collaboratively construct a fictional context they construct a shared vision of that context. When people\u2019s individual visions of that context differ they can suffer what I call a \u2018desync\u2019 where they attempt to build on the current context in a way that has been established as impossible within the shared fictional context, but would be possible within their personal version of that context.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Example:<br/>\nPlayer_A: My character runs out the door.<br/>\nPlayer_B: You can\u2019t do that, the door was destroyed when the roof collapsed.<br/>\nPlayer_A: It was?<br/>\nPlayer_B: Yeah. It was all covered in rubble.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes time and effort to look something up on a character sheet, or to flip through a book to find a particular rule. Some subsystems themselves have very elaborate or time consuming mechanics. A single die-roll or coin-flip takes very little energy. A die-roll that has thirty modifiers on it requires more energy. A die-roll that must consult tables takes even more energy, especially if the table has to be dug out of the middle of a book. For every second that it costs you to engage a particular mechanic, the higher the overall cost of the mechanic.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn short, the higher the amount of time you have to spend within the \u2018boxes\u2019 section of Vincents chart without a connecting arrow back to the fiction, the bigger the hit in terms of shared world continuity between the players, and the more likely that people\u2019s individual copy of that context will change.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found that systems that spend a lot of time in the boxes section of Vincents diagrams can have a problem with desync. Without a constant stream of communication between players updating the shared fictional context, each players personal copy of the context has a tendency to diverge.<br/>\nThis problem is often exacerbated because that arrow from the mechanics to the fiction can be very \u2018narrow\u2019, in that the mechanics only feed back into a small part of the current fictional context.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause the mechanics update only part of the fictional context, people who have ownership only over areas not affected by that update also suffer from a loss of engagement. In extreme cases, such as during long combat rounds during which the player cannot engage with either the fiction or the mechanics, players can stop updating their own copy of the fictional context entirely.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf an adventurer swings a sword and hits a goblin for a small amount of damage, and you control neither the adventurer, the sword, or the goblin, you probably don\u2019t care that much about what just happened. If it\u2019s been forty five minutes since the last time that the fiction that you own (your character, in this case) has engaged either the fiction or the mechanics, then you have probably stopped paying attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis leads to the frequent scenario of someone being called upon to take their combat turn and asking \u201cOk. What\u2019s happening?\u201d They no longer have any idea what is going on within the cloud and must get a full update before they can start playing again.<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of GM advice boils down to various ways of making sure that desync doesn\u2019t happen: engage the Players senses, share the spotlight, provide constant status updates etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nMechanics can do a lot of really awesome things to the fiction. That\u2019s why we use them. They take the fiction in directions we would not go without them. They make interesting, and awful things happen. Engaging the mechanics, when they work, revitalizes the fiction. It adds excitement and uncertainty.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I started thinking about this, I realized that in order to be a \u2018good\u2019 mechanic from a fiction-building perspective, it has to revitalize the fiction MORE than it costs the group to engage it. This is relatively easy to do for mechanics that are simple and quick to use, but for heavy, time consuming, or complicated mechanics, they must hit the fictional context like hammer blows because otherwise they are a drag on the game as a whole.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don\u2019t really have a point about any of this. I think there are many fine games that have mechanics with a very high cost of engagement, but personally I hate desync. It\u2019s one of my pet peeves of gaming, and I\u2019m interested in hearing what other people\u2019s experiences with it have been.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my case, writing this down has made me think about what I\u2019m doing with my mechanics and I am going to make sure that my mechanics feed back into the fiction with enough force to make up for the frequency with which they need to be engaged.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381132/#Comment_381132" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-07T05:05:25+00:00" title="June  7, 2012  5:05AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't lose sight of the fact that mechanics are an important tool to communicate the fiction, i.e. they can enhance or impair the "sync" you are talking about.

Certain mechanics, like Apocalypse World's Moves, actively keep you in the fictional mindset and seem to avoid these concerns.

I originally had a paragraph in there about Apocalypse World.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Moves in Apocalypse World are very light-weight mechanics. You always roll the same number of the same type of dice. There is always only one or two modifiers on the roll, and those modifiers are right on your sheet. The consequences of the Move are also right there for everyone to see.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm a programmer so I see them as 'rpg scripts' rather than something like a D&amp;D; combat system which is more like a large compiled program.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, Apocalypse World binds the 'cloud-to-box' arrow and the 'box-to-cloud' arrow directly together. In order to do it, you have to do it. You <i>can't</i> engage a mechanic without the fictional positioning necessary to do so, and when you encounter that fictional position then you <i>must</i> engage the mechanic.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's very clever, and in my experience produces very little desync. The value you get from the mechanics far outweighs the cost of engaging them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have never played Polaris, so I can't comment on how effective the ritual phrases are.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems that there are two big options if you want mechanics to effectively feed back into the fiction. You can either have them be very very simple to engage (like Apocalypse World), or they can update large chunks of the fiction (like Marvel Heroic Roleplay).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381174/#Comment_381174" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-07T08:26:20+00:00" title="June  7, 2012  8:26AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoa, Polaris causes LESS desynchronization?

Now, if engaging the system's mechanics is actually confusing (I'm looking at Burning Wheel Fight, here) or boring (D&amp;D modifer lookups, for me) then you can't blame uninvolved players for losing focus, noodling with their character sheet, making dice towers, and so forth. But if you have a player or players that totally check out of play if they aren't in the spotlight every five minutes, you need either new players or a system that keeps them engaged at all times (ex: a system with a lot of distributed authority/GM roles). Great Ork Gods did this in an interesting way:<br>* Every player controls an ork and controls a god.<br>* If your ork is acting, all the other players "portray" their gods, heaping hate on your ork so that he (hopefully) fails.<br><br>Thus, EVERY action engages EVERY player. Huh... kind of like Munchkin, now that I think of it.<br><br>So, make your system--regardless of its Handling Time--require participation by all players at all times. Avoid systems that create a laser-like focus on one PC, with one authority/GM, leaving every other player as a spectator.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381202/#Comment_381202" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-07T09:50:42+00:00" title="June  7, 2012  9:50AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JackFractal</cite>This is something that is very specific: a desync is what happens when the fictional context differs between players.</blockquote>\nIt just seems hopelessly wrong to say that Polaris has few of these compared to other games. <i>This is all that player action in Polaris is.</i>  There is never a moment where the fictional context of two players in Polaris are the same, we're all negating and compromising and pitching each other every time we speak.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JackFractal" title="JackFractal"><img alt="JackFractal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JackFractal">JackFractal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381218/#Comment_381218" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-07T10:45:12+00:00" title="June  7, 2012 10:45AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 7, 2012 10:46AM by JackFractal.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Handling time!

Distributed Location Gaming (DLG) causes all sorts of confusions and unparallel share imagined spaces, and it's not because of handling time at all.</blockquote>\nYeah, most of the issues with shared imaginary space in larp, especially medium to large games, comes from the difficulty of communicating changes in the game state to everyone.<br/><br/>Many games address this by severely limiting the type of creative work you can do during uptime as a player. In a tabletop game, you can explore a new world in space and one of the players can decide that the oceans are purple and bam, it's true (if that's how such decisions are being made for your game and group). In a medium to large larp (20ish to hundreds of players) it's usually impossible for that sort of thing to be decided by one player and meaningfully communicated to everyone else. Sure, you might say you come from a world that's not in anyone else's backstory and say that the oceans there are purple, but nobody else is going to know that unless they talk to you (and they're probably going to forget anyway, cause it's not really relevant to anything important). But you can't say that the world your on right now has purple oceans, which you just made up off the top of your head, and expect everyone else who is playing a character that is supposed to know about this world to suddenly know that.<br/><br/>Interestingly, larps are a good example of design that usually limits handling time down to the smallest it can possibly be. When I engage in a boffer fight in a relatively lightweight combat system game, there is so little handling time that it's almost nonexistant. Usually all I have to do is keep a count of my hit point pool in my head so I know if I run out, plus keep a count of energy points so I know if I can keep throwing my special moves or not. And if I'm not sure on either, I generally err on the side of assuming I'm out of points (and fall down or stop throwing specials).<br/><br/>Other than that, the only handling time is the occasional clarification - usually a newer player not sure what one of the more complicated special powers does. The person who used it gives a quick explanation, the target either counters it or takes the effect, and they get back to fighting.<br/><br/>That's the ideal, of course. The more complicated the system, the more clarifications are needed. Which is why designers usually try to be as intuitive and clear and clean as possible in their designs. Clarity and ease of learning/remembering is usually valued over flexibility and creativity in application.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred" title="Wightbred"><img alt="Wightbred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/349/nEG30XDP3MO0A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred">Wightbred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381299/#Comment_381299" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-07T17:01:38+00:00" title="June  7, 2012  5:01PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JackFractal</cite><br/>When I started thinking about this, I realized that in order to be a \u2018good\u2019 mechanic from a fiction-building perspective, it has to revitalize the fiction MORE than it costs the group to engage it. This is relatively easy to do for mechanics that are simple and quick to use, but for heavy, time consuming, or complicated mechanics, they must hit the fictional context like hammer blows because otherwise they are a drag on the game as a whole.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>In my case, writing this down has made me think about what I\u2019m doing with my mechanics and I am going to make sure that my mechanics feed back into the fiction with enough force to make up for the frequency with which they need to be engaged.</blockquote>\nI really like this concept that the value must be more than the cost. It resonates with me as a clear way to focus design. Sure there are ways to reduce the mechanical effect: you could map the mechanics with function points (roll 2d +add together +stat +mod = 4 steps) and cut them back to reduce the cost. But ultimately whatever the mechanics you want must get value for the game like a financial investment, so high cost mechanics must bring high rewards for the game.<br/><br/>The other thought I had flowing from this is that the mechanics are a tool to drive the fiction in unexpected directions, so they must be involved frequently enough to do that. In Fiasco you choose a die every scene (was this good or bad?) which is just the right level of engagement in that game to drive people's creativity to unexpected places. If the overhead is too high so we never use the mechanics we might as well just be playing cops and robbers. Or to extend my previous analogy: if you never invest in the market you will never make any money.

It dies and falls to the ground!<br/>Player 2: What if instead of just falling to the ground it fell on your sister?<br/>Player 1: That's grim... I like it.<br/>Player 2: Cool. The dragon falls on your sister. Splat!</blockquote>\nThis is not desync. The fictional context of the action has not been... confirmed I guess, by the group consensus until the last line.<br/><br/>Before that it is a proposed addition to that context. The process by which things are added to the fictional context varies from scenario to scenario, and is often mediated by mechanics. However, proposing a new fact does not imply that there is a different fictional context between players. That fact is nebulous until 'committed' to the shared fictional space by the group as a whole.<br/><br/>In traditional games, the ability to 'commit' facts to the shared fictional context is entirely in the hands of the gm. Such as:\n<blockquote>Player 1: I draw my sword and stab it!<br/>GM: OK. Go ahead.<br/>Player 1 : *rolls dice*</blockquote>\nA desync only happens when previously committed facts differ between players versions of the fictional context. It also does not occur when someone loses the narrative thread like this:\n<blockquote>Player 1: So there's this woman and she's trying to sell you a rug. "It's a magic rug!", she says.<br/>Player 2: I ask her her name.<br/>Player 1: Uh her name is... uh... her name is...<br/><br/>... <br/><br/><br/>dang...<br/><br/><br/>Maggy? we've already got a Maggy...<br/><br/><br/>... hmm...<br/><br/><br/>Player 2: Player 1?<br/>Player 1: Sorry, I can't decide on her name.<br/>Player 2: What about Jim-Bob?<br/>Player 1: Sure, whatever. Her name is Jim-Bob.</blockquote>\nThat kind of thread-loss can lead to desync if it goes on for a long time, but on its own it's not altering the narrative space. That kind of thing is more like... a really heavy mechanic. It causes lag in the fiction update loop, which can cause desync, but is not desync itself.<br/><br/>What I'm calling desync is what happens when people get previously committed facts wrong, whether because they weren't clearly established or because their version of the fictional context has drifted from consensus.\n<blockquote>Player 3: Ok. So I go and find Player 1's sister and get her to tell me where the key is. <br/>Player 2: But she was crushed by a dragon!<br/>Player 3: She was?<br/>Player 1: Yeah, like a couple of paragraphs up.</blockquote>\n<i>That</i> is a desync.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381327/#Comment_381327" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-07T18:27:26+00:00" title="June  7, 2012  6:27PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So desynch is when Shared Imaginary Space (SIS) diverges.<br/><br/>So what you're saying is that long handling time CAN often lead to divergent SIS.

The issue isn't that the imaginary space is different. It's always going to be different, because we're not telepaths. People will always picture things differently. <br/><br/>It only becomes a 'desync' when two people's internal visions collide.<br/><br/>If there's a character and I'm picturing her as blond and you're picturing her as a brunette, but the colour of her hair never comes up in play?

I just stop paying attention when stuff doesn't influence my decisions. At that point the stuff people talk about is just unclearly conveyed fiction, and I'd rather have someone tell me a compelling story. This is why large groups have often sucked for me, as there is much downtime and I stop paying attention. When I design and run I always try to engage every player constantly and keep their affairs heavily intertwined instead of everyone having their own little quests.<br/><br/>Two days ago I was playing this boardgame Chaos in the Old World, which is quite complex compared to RPGs. But I was riveted, because those bits of mechanics influenced my decisions all the time. Also, all that information is visible on the map in form of figures and tokens. I don't have to remember anything, which is a blessing for me. Many say that physical components, especially boards and figures, aren't immersive tools. However, they can really alleviate desynch: maybe the world is plastic, but at least I know what it looks like. If there's a restaurant back door, I can see it on board, I don't have to remember or deduct its existence.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
