Let me first say, while I've been on the outskirts of several aspects of the retro gaming scene -- mostly through programming music with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Sound_DJ" rel="nofollow">Little Sound DJ</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KORG_DS-10" rel="nofollow">Korg DS-10</a> -- that I'm not an expert, have very little experience, and have not really participated in any community aspects like blogs or forums.  That said, here's what I've learned.<br/><br/>Making 8 or 16-bit video game art is easy.  Making stuff that's actually good takes talent and a LOT of time pushing pixels around.  Check out <a href="http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f230/ben2theedge/Scott%20Pilgrim/screen_a_robot.png" rel="nofollow">this image from the back cover of Scott Pilgrim 5.</a>  That's a fair bit of work right there.<br/><br/>One of the easiest ways to begin is by hacking existing art ripped from your favorite video games.  You'll probably want to start with 2-D side-scrolling or isometric (like Zelda: Link to the Past) games, because the false 3-D stuff like Starfox, Super Mario Kart, Donkey Kong Country, and Super Mario RPG is another level of difficult.<br/><br/>Programs you'll want to use include Photoshop (if you have it) of any edition, Pixen, or even MS Paint if you have to.  On my old Windows machine I have Photoshop 5.0 LE, which is old as all fuck, but perfect for this kind of low-res stuff.  On my Mac I've been messing with Pixen and it's really great for this except runs a bit slow when messing with many layers or larger images.<br/><br/>Games that are good for basic hacking include stuff made for the original Nintendo, Gameboy, Super Nintendo, Gameboy Color, or Gameboy Advance.  You could also do Sega stuff, but I know zilch about that since I was always a Nintendo junkie.<br/><br/>Good places to look for art to hack include <a href="http://www.vgmaps.com/" rel="nofollow">The Video Game Atlas</a> (for maps) and <a href="http://www.spriters-resource.com/" rel="nofollow">the Spriter's Resource</a> for general sprites.<br/><br/><b>Important Things to Think About</b><br/><br/>8 and 16 bit video game art is typically created by combining tiles of 8x8, 16x16, or 32x32 pixels in various combinations.  This is pretty easy to see in most games.  These are the basic components and each tile has to look great by itself as well as in combination with other tiles.  Mastering good tile design is at least 60% of the challenge here.<br/><br/>The other 40%, as far as I can tell is something that's slightly less intuitive to think about when you're not actually designing for a video game: screen layout.  Let me use a Zelda example to show what I mean.  When you play Zelda, the screen doesn't shift across the landscape as you move but only changes to a new location when Link exits the current "screen" by walking off to the side or exiting through a doorway.  The original Gameboy screen was 160 x 144 pixels, but then you have to have a status bar across the bottom showing Link's life and current weapons.  This means that the entire world map of <i>Link's Awakening</i> is divided into 160 x 128 pixel screens, each of which is always viewed independently by the player, who never sees them connected together.  I've marked them on this sample to show what I mean:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://plays-well.com/screens.png"/><br/><br/>Even games where the camera follows the movement of the protagonist are limited in what they can show a player.  You still are looking at one screen worth of image at a time, so each and every screen's worth better have something interesting and aesthetically pleasing going on in it.  Consequently, old school video game maps and images are hyper-dense with content, implications, and meaning.  But this is also helpful to would-be hackers and designers because it means you can design in pieces, one "screen" at a time even if you ultimately plan on producing something huge.  After all, each screen of <i>Link's Awakening</i> is essentially a 10 x 8 grid tiles that are each 16 x 16 pixels.  Looking at it that way, things look much more manageable.<br/><br/>Anyway, there's a start.  I welcome questions of all kinds and may post some great tricks I've found working with Pixen if anybody else is interested.  Also, if anybody else has been doing this longer than me (i.e. more than 3 days) and has some great suggestions, I'd love to hear them.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201361/#Comment_201361" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-09T01:38:31+00:00" title="April  9, 2009  1:38AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is cool Jonathan.

Could you do some game that doesn't involve accessing the menu every five seconds? My pinkies still get twitchy because of some of those dungeons.<br/><br/>The reason for why I'm interested in Jonathan's exploration of this sort of thing is that I, and I suspect others of my generation, respond naturally and emotionally to this era of videogames. Look at Yonder Knights in the recent competition, it got my buy-in without even having to drag in the pixel art. I think that this whole thing would be an excellent topic for a roleplaying game, a bit like saturday morning cartoons are; a robust, recognizable culture that is easy to engage with for anybody familiar with it already. If only we could combine Jonathan's obvious passion for the topic with Jason Morningstar's work ethics...<br/><br/>Heck, the only reason I'm not making some sort of Zelda knockoff tabletop game myself is that... well, apparently I'm stupid or something. I just twiddle with TSoY instead of cutting little Carcassonne tiles out of pixel graphics to design a game of grand exploration without those annoying flow control features video games have. Just imagine, a Zelda game where you wouldn't need to actually choose and use the fucking hammer just to get from one screen to the next one...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201381/#Comment_201381" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-09T05:45:40+00:00" title="April  9, 2009  5:45AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>John:</b> Cool.  I'm finding it's closely related to graphic design and layout work, more so than illustration, because of the fairly strict limitations of the early systems, though some of the later stuff like <i>Yoshi's Island</i> (which had a really sketchy design style) is more artsy.  I'm excited to see anything you end up producing.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>If only we could combine Jonathan's obvious passion for the topic with Jason Morningstar's work ethics...</blockquote>\nBy which you mean... you want something doing this with the discipline to actually finish a game? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  Thanks, Eero.  I appreciate your confidence.<br/><br/><b>Some Thoughts on Tile Design</b><br/><br/>At Eero's request, here's an example from a different Zelda game, <i>The Minish Cap</i>, which may be the last of the isometric games since the new ones for the DX (<i>Phantom Hourglass</i> and the upcoming <i>Spirit Tracks</i>) are in 3-D.  I've never actually played <i>Minish Cap</i> but I've been blown away by the design and especially the color scheme of the images I've seen.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://plays-well.com/minish.png"/><br/><br/>If you look carefully at the tiles here, you'll see that there are essentially three kinds of tiles:<br/><br/>1. Tiles that create a certain kind of background terrain (water, grass, etc.)<br/>2. Tiles that transition between different kinds of background terrain (water to grass, etc.)<br/>3. Tiles that show objects or characters that sit on top of the terrain (rocks, trees, houses, ladders, etc.)<br/><br/>On any given screen, these three types of tiles are present in roughly equal proportion, which is important to giving each screen that dense feeling I mentioned earlier.  You'll notice that type 2 transition tiles are not present in the <i>Link's Awakening</i> example I showed earlier.  Each tile cuts immediately to a different type of terrain.  My sense is that transition tiles are a product of the upgrade from 8 to 16-bit graphics and are very important to the feeling of Super Nintendo or Gameboy Advance graphics.<br/><br/>You'll also notice that the color scheme of type 1 tiles is very simple, usually two or three closely related colors that denote a specific type of terrain.  For water, you might have a medium blue base and then a darker blue and lighter blue to show ripples or edges.<br/><br/>Type 2 tiles, since they transition from one type of terrain to another, combine two different color schemes and gradually shift between them.  Still, you're not going to see more than six colors on a tile and they'll usually be divided between two distinct, related color schemes.<br/><br/>Type 3 object tiles are very much like type 2 transitional tiles because an object sits on the terrain and usually has to be incorporated into it around the edges of the object tiles.  Consequently, you'll see different object types that are always mixed with certain types of terrain.  The rocks on land and the rocks in the water are different tiles showing different kinds of rocks.<br/><br/>Finally, I want to point out one thing that <i>blows my mind</i>.  Check out the cliff face in the lower right part of the example.  Notice how the cliff part that sits over the water has a slightly different coloration than the cliff that sits over the grass?  There are tiles in <i>The Minish Cap</i> that show slight lighting effects such as light reflecting off the water making the cliff face slightly blue.  That's nuts but also adds to the feel of the graphics immensely.  There are also at least two different cliff face tiles for <i>different colors of water</i>.  This is the one for light blue, shallow water, but there's another one for the darker water at the top of the example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201392/#Comment_201392" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-09T07:29:30+00:00" title="April  9, 2009  7:29AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 9, 2009 7:36AM by timfire.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Making 8 or 16-bit video game art is easy.

It's freeware (open source) and it has plenty of power for doing tile design or hack-and-layout.<br/><br/>Oh, and another thing: the nostalgia thing is cool, but there's something to be said for going ahead and making pretty tiles, as one can use them as "brushes" in GIMP (and Illustrator) to draw very large-scale maps for actual play (minis).<br/><br/>OK, and a third thing: Gamasutra has a few older articles in the archives which talk about tile design, in particular transitioning tiles and fast ways to do the work in Photoshop with blending of texture layers and layer masking.

I worked things out with 'bounding boxes', like, boxy outlines around hands, torso and head, etc, kinda like an artist's mannequin. Then you fill in from there. On sprites, use black lines and contrasting flat colours to make things recognisable, and only then use texture, shade and highlights within that. There's plenty of tricks to make things interesting here, but mostly I'd just copy from the masters; the good thing about pixel art is that you can always see EXACTLY how something is done. Try and keep all lines at 45 or 90 degrees; if you deviate from that then you are drawing a new line.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt higher resolutions, you can pretty much forget all that. Just draw/paint/whatever and scale it to fit and correct anything that obviously doesn't look right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Cleaver" title="Dave Cleaver"><img alt="Dave Cleaver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dscleaver.googlepages.com/avatar_small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Cleaver">Dave Cleaver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201423/#Comment_201423" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-09T09:56:17+00:00" title="April  9, 2009  9:56AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>it has tiles with big ol' overlapping extensions coming out of the top (like the tree and so on), which add a lot of depth.</blockquote>\nIn isometric games there are often 4 tiles at work in each cell - the floor, two "walls", and an object.

One would be to simply type up some text in photoshop, turn off any anti-aliasing and enlarge the resulting flattened file. Another, which I would recommend, is to find a font that is designed for to be pixel-perfect for the web and just type it up in a large size in your chosen layout program.<br/><br/>Here are several bitmaps for you to choose from: <a href="http://www.dafont.com/bitmap.php" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dafont.com/bitmap.php</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
