I'm not sure why I feel the need to tell you that it's a role-playing game beings that this is a forum for that kind of thing, but there you have it.  <br/><br/>At first I was all like, "what is this... "Primetime Fiasco-versalis?", but after reading and playing it, it's really not too bad.  <br/><br/>Yes, the Diana Jones winner is not too bad.  Shocking, I know.  <br/><br/>I do think chargen could be better supported(like Fiasco).  <br/>There's still a fair bit of verbal back and forth(which is fine and dandy, but it's time-consuming); with me(GM)trying to gently drive and distill.  It still takes a bit of creatively saying no, more often then I'd like.  There's a lot of story knowledge that players need in order to make a dramatic ensemble cast.  Even Fiasco takes a bit of this to get something good going.  I've thrown out starting Relationships, Wants, Objects...just because nothing seemed to click.  <br/>I like playing 3 player Fiasco.  It focuses the game, while negating the bullshit.  I think it'd be the way to test whether some Relationships are poor, while others powerful.  For awhile I was playing Fiasco wrong; we had games with more then one Want and no Location.  I don't find locations that useful.  I think a location get's made through play, but to some, maybe a prompt is a nice thing?<br/><br/>So, back to Hillfolk.  <br/>I like that player characters start off wanting something(usually an abstract concept)from 2 other player characters.<br/>It might be nice to offer some support for character transformation.  When a character's Wants change.  Dramatic resolution is slightly handwavy.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437888/#Comment_437888" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-28T13:11:30+00:00" title="August 28, 2014  1:11PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice. <br/><br/>For three people I know, it's the only RPG they've ever played, and whilst the other four of us were hardened gamers, it didn't seem difficult for the beginners to engage with and enjoy the game.<br/><br/>The only problem I've had with it, is that sometimes demands escalate very quickly. It's not gone gonzo the way Fiasco usually does, but there's not always enough room for the fiction to develop. In fact the drive to resolve seems more a feature of experienced gamers.

It was as good as the best bits of Fate and Primetime Adventures. I was stoked at how it points PCs at each other without making them need to kill each other.<br/><br/>We hit scenes, and it's meaty. The players are going full tilt on making demands, and I'm loving this game. I'm taking mental notes left and right, and I cannot wait for my turn.<br/><br/>Then... we stop. At the end of the scene, we stop and talking through who gave in and who got what they wanted, and we do that bit of business. It doesn't break the flow <i>exactly</i>, but it's a hiccup.<br/><br/>We go into the next scene. More awesome drama, making demands, countering, politicking. The GM inserts some tension, things are getting juicy again.<br/><br/>Then... we stop. End of scene, we become the tribunal. We adjudicate how things went, make the call on who gets chips and yeah, the pace is flagging. My brain has trouble dropping out of character, I'm getting fatigued and it's only been a half hour.<br/><br/>We do this for three hours. Play. Play hard. Stop. Talk about it. Move coins around. Then back in. And the mechanics feel like they want to reward a play style and choices that I already embrace. I don't have to be the diva, I'm happy to ham it up and be a beta. And I'm not seeing where the mechanics are fun for me. I'm not learning things. I'm not motivated by the mechanics, they only interrupt the flow of the freeform that we're grooving.<br/><br/>And maybe, probably, we did it wrong.

I wasn't sure if it was in the sense of hamming up the acting side of things. <br/><br/>I think it does do that in the direct sense - but it also encourages the diva as a character type, in a slightly different way. Concede on two things that someone else thinks is a big deal but you don't have that much problem with, and you can force someone to do your bidding via emotional blackmail on your next go. So you can <i>Desperate Housewives</i> your way through life, even if your direct browbeating power is initially constrained. <br/><br/>I don't think it would be appropriate to play for keeps in that way in every game, but the system supports a certain level of Machiavellianism. <br/><br/>I wonder if the issue of too much stopping and starting might be helped by cutting down on the petitioner/granter talk in the rules text. Given the existence of soft opens and two-way exchanges, it could be better to approach it along the lines of "when you're in a scene, think about what you want - if someone gives you what you want, give them a token". <br/>Instead of formally outlining those two fixed roles, which sets up a whole bunch more things to debate in between scenes.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>While we're at it, I'm not sure no-contest scenes need to be separated out either. If you have no problem giving the other person what they want, just take the token!                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438112/#Comment_438112" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-05T04:48:57+00:00" title="September  5, 2014  4:48AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>edit: I should mention, I agree that the <i>Hillfolk</i> text comes across as very mechanistic, spending a lot of word count on adjudicating the results of edge cases and skipping very quickly over the fact that if the petitioner decides to give the granter a token, no one is allowed to argue about that. <br/>I have observed that early sessions of <i>Hillfolk</i> involve more out-of-character discussion about token exchanges.

Don't do the meta-analysis. The GM should quash it. Only invoke the other rules in the rare cases where it is required. The petitioner and granter exchange is by far the most common one, and the rules make this very straightforward to handle, as well as framing scenes dramatically rather than have them wander around.<br/><br/>Two token forces are absolutely constrained by the nature of the character who is being forced. It is not a life-changing epiphany. You can stop of force with extra tokens, and others can step in to help you. <br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438257/#Comment_438257" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-11T08:45:00+00:00" title="September 11, 2014  8:45AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there should be a way for players to force an action type onto another player, or maybe just negating one action type?  I think it's a bit handwavy to just say that the GM picks your players action type.  All players action types to be exact.<br/><br/>Andy - I'm playing Hillfolk sort of wrong; with my friend and his preteen daughter.  The group is too small(and playtime too short), at least right now for it to function exactly as written.  I explain rules to people differently, usually poorly.  I am doing a bit more leading as GM then I am used to.   I'm more interested in what my friends daughter thinks of teenaged women(whom she is pretending to be), then of rules particulars right now.<br/><br/>Hillfolk is a fairly lightweight game.  I can nitpick a game with the best, but currently I have no huge glaring issues with it.  The art is lovely, and the book beautiful.  <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
