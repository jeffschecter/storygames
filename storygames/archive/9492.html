Why? "Episodic sessions with a well defined goal" If it is to be approached in a narrativist way, I think DitV really could bring the game to great resolutions.<br/><br/>So yeah, any advice on how to tweak the system to better represent Assassin's Creed?<br/><br/>I personally think some good mapping of important places would be good for this purpose.<br/>Investigation might be a problem, though, don't know how well the conflict resolution system would do with it.<br/><br/>Link to vids: <a href="http://events.uk.ubi.com/assassin-s-creed-2/" rel="nofollow">[here]</a></span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Omar_Ramirez" title="Omar_Ramirez"><img alt="Omar_Ramirez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/370/nVR0Z4SVM1FWT.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Omar_Ramirez">Omar_Ramirez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210461/#Comment_210461" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-05T06:15:36+00:00" title="June  5, 2009  6:15AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="color: navy;">Come on guys, don't let me hanging.<br/><br/>And adding to the topic:<br/><br/>I'm trying to think of a way to make a "situation progression" (as in: pride - sin - false doctrine - false priesthood - etc...) but I can't quite come up with it...<br/><br/>What I can think about is that it most probably have to reach at least some 4 levels and that every level should generate an NPC and a piece of information to retrieve.<br/><br/>And one question, has anybody had a chase with the conflict resolution system?</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson" title="Ben_Johnson"><img alt="Ben_Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/2131054135_2403ed15ce_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson">Ben_Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210466/#Comment_210466" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-05T06:38:35+00:00" title="June  5, 2009  6:38AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Given that Assassin's Creed follows a single protagonist, I think you'd be best served by searching the web for advice about running Dogs with one GM and one player. Otherwise, in addition to drifting the rules (which you won't be doing very much) you're drifting the setting.<br/><br/>Don't worry about coming up with alternate names for the progression of sins if they're going to work the same way (that is, contribute the same amount of opposition dice).<br/><br/>Otherwise, yeah, sounds like a pretty good match. A vigilante passing judgement backed up by a society of likeminded vigilante philosophers. The only major difference is that the assassins are not recognized as legitimate dispensers of justice and judgement. In Dogs, I can drag the mayor into the street and shoot him, and society blesses it. In Assassin's Creed is that players cannot do this, and are forced to stick to the shadows, etc.<br/><br/>Schedule a game session, try to accomplish Assassin's Creed in the Dogs system while drifting as little as possible (start with absolutely no mechanical changes). If you run into something that just doesn't work, figure out why it isn't working, and that should suggest how the system needs to be drifted. Then come back here and give an Actual Play writeup and let us know how it all went.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Omar_Ramirez" title="Omar_Ramirez"><img alt="Omar_Ramirez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/370/nVR0Z4SVM1FWT.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Omar_Ramirez">Omar_Ramirez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210469/#Comment_210469" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-05T07:08:45+00:00" title="June  5, 2009  7:08AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 5, 2009 7:09AM by Omar_Ramirez.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="color: navy;">Yeah, I already thought about the 1 on 1 play and read a little topic <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9409&amp;page=1#Item_64" rel="nofollow">here</a> and one more specific to DitV <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=27233.0" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

Here's what I've thought so far (as in, while in the bus on my way to school):<br/><br/>There are some element I seem crucial to the successful emulation of AC with DitV:<br/><br/><br/>The strong implementation of the Creed itself in-game<br/>The possibility to gain the aid of towns people (as this'll most likely be a one on one game)<br/>The know that this game is about missions<br/>The fact that the player can't possibly fail (and this one is the tricky one)<br/><br/><br/>Now, aside from these above elements (and there might be more I haven't thought of... or maybe less o_O) I think you can pretty much extend in any possible way. To me it seems (with what's been shown in the E3 demo) that these elements were given enough importance to maintain them. One key element they seem to be going for, and that wasn't part of the first game, is "lots of variety". I personally think this variety shouldn't be hard to get in a table top RPG form.<br/><br/>And yes, I agree with you. You need a world where talking is as important as fighting. But I have a different perspective here. In the game, there were lots of talking, but it was not part of the gameplay itself, it was linear and was only cinematic (for obvious reasons). But in an RPG this can be overcome. You no longer have to have a scripted chat between the protagonist and the NPCs, you can actually have interaction with them. Bear in mind Altair had issues with the creed, he thought himself above it and went in a constant discussion with the the master assassin about it. this can now be played trough the conflict resolution system.<br/><br/>Now, how do we maintain the elements we need to emulate Assassin's Creed?<br/><br/>The strong implementation of the creed, even if not entirely followed by the main character, mind you, gives the setting enough structure. the brotherhood itself gives the same support to the plot as the faith in the original setting.<br/><br/>The possibility to gain the aid of townspeople. And I do think this one's important, this aid, even in the electronic game, can often be he difference between success and failure. I do think, though, that one can get way more creative with it. Not just have the brothers of some 10 women in distress help you by blocking the way of your enemies or have scholars help you infiltrate highly guarded locations. Make the assistance more interesting by having interesting NPCs give it to the player. Make people who're being victims of the injustice generated by the target's actions give the player assistance to eliminate that who's interfering with their well being.<br/><br/>Know that the game is about missions. Just as in dogs, you go to a town to see what are it's sins and cleanse it from faulty individuals. Here it is no different, except, this one time, you already know who you need to get rid of from the beginning.<br/><br/>The player can't possibly fail. And this is the one that worries me. This game should be centered on the character, it missions and the discoveries he makes while advancing the plot. If the character were to die, the whole game (in my opinion) would crumble around it. This gives us a little of a problem. How do we tread this the appropriate way? In the video game, when you loose, you simply go back to the last checkpoint and re.try the mission. Do we do this same thing in an RPG? how many times is it too much times to try? when do we get sick of trying? conversely, what about being able to fail only investigation and townspeople aiding missions but, as you stated, not being able to fail the main assassination? This represents a problem of it's own. for then the challenge of the actual assassination is completely lost. How much does this affect the enjoyment of the game itself?<br/><br/>Thanks for your comment, it really got me thinking n_n.</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Omar_Ramirez" title="Omar_Ramirez"><img alt="Omar_Ramirez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/370/nVR0Z4SVM1FWT.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Omar_Ramirez">Omar_Ramirez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210489/#Comment_210489" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-05T08:42:39+00:00" title="June  5, 2009  8:42AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="color: navy;"><a href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">@JDCorley</a> <br/><br/>How so?

Player builds Assassin, who has to be good at the following things: acrobatics; throwing; sneaking; fighting; interrogation; different PCs maybe have different strengths? DitV might work fine for this;<br/>2. GM creates Setting which is made up of several Cities, each of which contains several Missions; Oracle?<br/>3. Missions structure<br/>     a) investigation;<br/>     b) assassination<br/>4. PC arrives in a City, and the first Mission is available. GM decides how many "mission points" are necessary to undertake the assassination; GM tells the player (via local agent) who the target is, and where the target can be found;<br/>     a) Investigation begins; player can choose to undertake investigations either by interrogation, theft, eavesdropping, or doing favours (which can be anything, including killing); completing an Investigation earns the PC missions points based on (type of activity; random roll; GM fiat; degree of success?); PC narrates successful investigations and determines what the mission points represent: layout, maps, secrets, other hints; when the PC has accrued sufficient mission points, he can either undertake the assassination or complete more investigations for bonus points;<br/>     b) Assassination begins; target has a variety of complications: guards, traps, strange plans, etc, which the PC must overcome; overcoming these obstacles requires the PC to spend mission points; when the required number of mission points is spent, PC assassinates the target; target lets slip some important information (oracle? PC narrates? GM + PC collaborate?)<br/>5. GM uses information from previous mission to prep next mission, regardless of which city;<br/>6. When all missions in all cities are complete, if it's worked well, then the story has unfolded.<br/><br/><i>edit: 4.b) for clarity</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Omar_Ramirez" title="Omar_Ramirez"><img alt="Omar_Ramirez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/370/nVR0Z4SVM1FWT.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Omar_Ramirez">Omar_Ramirez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210821/#Comment_210821" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-07T20:01:17+00:00" title="June  7, 2009  8:01PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 7, 2009 9:20PM by Omar_Ramirez.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="color: navy;">Really interesting take.<br/><br/>I hadn't considered the invertigation points, but it may be a good idea.</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Those are the questions I think the videogame poses, so that's what I tried to stick to. The eventual assassination is inevitable, but it doesn't happen in a vacuum, and there are multiple approaches to most of the kills.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

I can see "making the choices the player makes to have effects on the consequences" as something akin to the traits that emerge from Fallout, for example.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.
