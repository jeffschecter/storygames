What kind of game is it? What's good, what's bad? What kind of person would like it? (i.e. if you like X then you'll like Unknown Armies).<br/><br/>Here's what their blurb says:\n<blockquote>Humans are the most powerful beings in the entire cosmos. Maybe not any one individual human, but the aggregate of humanity -- a mass entity capable of restarting time with a thought -- far outshines the stars and outweighs the planets. But that means the world is only as good as we make it. We have to get busy and lead. Order or entropy -- structure or chaos? What will you risk to change the world? Make the choice in Unknown Armies: A Game of Power and Consequences.<br/><br/>Self-mutilating magi, avatars of the Mystic Hermaphrodite, an obsessed millionaire's personal foreign legion -- Unknown Armies reveals an Occult Underground of oddities, of madness and horror, and of hidden symbols that transcend the world. It's "Pulp Fiction meets Hellraiser." For good and for ill, the fate of the cosmos is always within your reach.<br/><br/>All the world's extremely extreme people can become members of the Invisible Clergy, the cardinal archetypes of a higher order of existence. But this membership is limited, competitive, and ever-changing. Anyone can be a demigod, and anyone can dispose of one. You yourself, if you've got what it takes, have a decent shot at joining the clergy -- but can you stay there long enough to reshape the universe?</blockquote>\nTell me more! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422383/#Comment_422383" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-03T13:06:27+00:00" title="October  3, 2013  1:06PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 3, 2013 4:11PM by Rickard.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unknown Armies is the one of the best written games out there.

Unknown Armies is a major example of that. The premise and setting are pretty far-out and the rules are relatively traditional and familiar but with several interesting bits that make it more than just a fun setting with a stats+skills+powers+roll-some-dice super boring system. From memory, the rules for exposure to stress and horror (and maybe physical harm?) are really super great, perhaps the best in roleplaying. The other killer app is the super strange magic system, where you can be a McDonalds-o-mancer, among other things, or attempt to mold yourself in the likeness of Platonic godlike concepts. If either of those sound interesting, sure, it's worth picking up and checking out. If not, you're not missing out hugely on the mechanical front; it's really the premise, terrific writing, and general 80s-90s-tastic supernatural strangeness that's the selling point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422389/#Comment_422389" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-03T15:40:26+00:00" title="October  3, 2013  3:40PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mechanically, the UA system is descended from BRP but it's a big improvement over it in many ways.  The system is simpler, cleaner, more consistent and filled with many interesting little bits.  Many of the parts of the game that were cutting edge there have become relatively common and normal in gaming (freeform skills, skills providing a penumbra of abilities related to their central task, defining your character by things they care about or believe in, etc.)  The madness system and magick systems are, indeed, still really worth checking out.<br/><br/>But the setting is probably the big draw, as it is full of interesting, creative stuff and has a unique tone and style not replicated in other RPGs.  and it will make you start looking at the world in a different way, thinking about the secret magickal process going on behind the scenes of the everyday, innocuous actions of your day-to-day life.\n<blockquote>(i.e. if you like X then you'll like Unknown Armies).</blockquote>\nIn this case, X equals Tim Powers, Hellblazer, The Invisibles, The Lost Room, Suppressed Transmissions, or Silent Hill.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422391/#Comment_422391" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-03T16:10:12+00:00" title="October  3, 2013  4:10PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I own all the books.

If you've been doing this hobby for years, and there's no end in sight, chances are that each well-crafted classic of the field, whether it's Paranoia or Ars Magica or Delta Green or Unknown Armies will be worth your while sooner or later. A human being and a scholar does themselves disservice by rationing books, as if they truly couldn't make room for the essentials in their reading itinerary.<br/><br/>(Playing all these excellent games is a different thing altogether, I admit. I have no illusions about my ability to make time for playing every excellent game ever written.)<br/><br/>Assuming the above sentiment appeals, the only question is whether Unknown Armies belongs in this nebulous canon of actually worthwhile game texts. I don't find it a controversial claim to say that it does: everybody and their uncle finds it an appealing delight, going by what the Internet has to say, and we can all name many entirely intelligent and discernible people who belong in the ranks of the fans of the game. Maybe you can find individuals who don't personally like Unknown Armies, but I can say that I've never encountered anybody who'd have additionally claimed that it is not a significant game - even those who don't like it personally generally acknowledge it as a higher-grade work.<br/><br/>I'll close off by noting that I haven't gotten around to checking out Unknown Armies myself, either, but from all accounts it's the sort of literarily ambitious game that I enjoy the most when it comes to trad games. Just as Jonathan says above, the best of the '90s era truly were the games that, while maybe conventional with their tools, attempted to transcend the common crop by sheer literary merit. In fact, now that I convinced myself about this, I'll need to go and finally read UA; I think I got it in some bundle or other a couple of years back...<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422412/#Comment_422412" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-04T03:57:29+00:00" title="October  4, 2013  3:57AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm no fan of BRP. This implementation has a couple of twiddles which make it more interesting and more fiddly, and no better on the whole. The treatment of madness has been expanded upon from Sanity to three (IIRR) madness meters with different effects when they fail. Characters have special abilities called cherries which happen when the dice match.<br/><br/>However, if you want to run any kind of modern day weird/occult/magic game than this is some of the best writing in those genres. In many games, like AD&amp;D, magic seems not to have any impact on the day to day world (although Eberron may have some ideas about this). In this game they have clearly thought about how magic integrates into modern society, and why it appears not to be present, except to the initiated. And the magic system in particular takes the vagueness of the Call of Cthulhu magic and ties the fiction to the mechanics in a very impressive way.<br/><br/>If you have any interest in such things, then it's definitely worth a read. I go back to it for my GUMSHOE games as it's a mine of ideas for Mutant City Blues, Night's Black Agents, Esoterrorists and even Trail of Cthulhu.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422426/#Comment_422426" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-04T12:07:58+00:00" title="October  4, 2013 12:07PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 4, 2013 12:09PM by Scrape.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As many have mentioned, the system is functional but not too exciting. The setting, however, is incredibly well-written and full of a million and one ideas. The core book alone is great, and each and every supplement is chock full of mind-bending stuff that is sure to spark your imagination. <br/><br/>The treatment of modern-day magick is great: it's powered by belief and symbolism- like, an occult artifact might be <i>The Final Syringe of Sid Vicious</i>. If you shoot drugs using Sid Vicious' syringe, you will be empowered when defying authority figures of all types, like escaping police or sabotaging a corporation. So in order to use "magick," you need to <i>believe</i> with all your heart and soul that these symbolic connections are Real and Powerful and that they <i>really can</i> change the world. And that's the problem: only a <i>crazy person</i> would believe that, right? You'd have to be <i>nuts</i> to think that shooting heroin from a dead junkie's needle would somehow give you magick powers. So everyone who works magick is, by definition, crazy. The occult underground are almost all scummy, backstabbing lunatics who trade away any sense of normality for desperate bids at power.<br/><br/>And the books are full of great examples of this symbolic magick in action, from the detached <i>Videomancers</i> (don't you wish life was more like the movies?), the obsessed <i>Pornomancers</i> (sex as ritual instead of connection), and the self-destructive <i>Epideromancers</i> (only by hurting yourself can you truly gain control over your body). All the 'schools' of magic include a central paradox, the core irony of the school. <i>Plutomancers</i>, for example, believe that money is power, literally. The more money they have, the more magick they can work. But there's a catch: <i>they're not allowed to spend that money</i>. They can never truly <i>enjoy </i>their wealth, because they've twisted a universal concept into a delusional maxim: <b>Money is Power</b>. Money doesn't exist to make you comfortable, or to have nice things, or even to impress people. <i>Money exists because Money is Power</i>, and that's it.<br/><br/>It's a really neat concept that plays around with the idea of symbolic magick and what that would really mean. The books are totally worth reading if only to steal the setting and play a FATE campaign with it (which is what I'm doing right now).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Terwox" title="Terwox"><img alt="Terwox" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/nSPMQ33PX1PEF.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Terwox">Terwox</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422429/#Comment_422429" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-04T14:15:12+00:00" title="October  4, 2013  2:15PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It's a really neat concept that plays around with the idea of symbolic magick and what that would really mean.

Lots of alternative takes on werewolves, magicians, ghosts and so on. Not very scary or existentialist, more of an urban fantasy with poseur aesthetics (people who are edgy because they cut themselves, that sort of thing), but flexible; you could utilize this stuff for an urban fantasy game along WW lines, or do something less superheroic. Not as grim as Delta Green or Wonderland, but not as fantasy-empowerment as say <i>Wyrd is Bond</i>, either. It's sort of like a more street-credible kissing-cousin of Mage: the Ascension, really.<br/><br/>I find the rules system academically interesting because I've long had the itch to maybe "solve" the BRP system and somehow make it work for me without relinquishing the percentage aesthetics. It's nothing that I would actually run myself, though; e.g. FATE or TSoY would be a superior choice. The setting-related rules mechanics of the Adept magic, on the other hand, are quite strong - magical charges, ritual magic, these elements work naturally in the context of realistic occult fantasy.<br/><br/>Well worth the time for the ideas, for anybody interested in the genre. Well worth the time for any scholar of trad gaming, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422441/#Comment_422441" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-04T19:25:51+00:00" title="October  4, 2013  7:25PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Could you expound a little more on playing Unknown Armies in a FATE game?  I've been curious about trying FATE again w/ the new rules (I had little luck w/ SotC) and a friend recently gave me his physical core book for UA.</blockquote>\nSure! I'm not super experienced with Fate, but this is what we're doing and it's been a blast. We used campaign Aspects like <i>The Occult Underground is Everywhere, Magick Demands Its Price,</i> and <i>Everyone Has A Secret</i> to foster the sort of insular, paranoid world depicted in the UA books. We're playing mundane characters, no Adepts in the party. We're private eyes for the occult underground so the PCs are all knowledgeable about Adepts and Avatars, but we haven't yet had to write a lot of hard rules for using magic. Here's what we've got so far:<br/><br/>We focused heavily on the symbolic aspect of Magick, and the rules for The Subtle Art (<b>page 101 in the Fate System Toolkit</b>) have covered everything so far. For flexible, on-the-spot magick use, there's a skill called <b>Belief</b> (you could also split this into <b>Magick</b> and <b>Channel Avatar</b> if you want), which you roll to Create an Advantage against an opponent after describing the symbolic actions you've taken to cast your spell (or behave in accordance with your Avatar and therefore gain a situational bonus). More powerful effects would be treated as Stunts- they'd be the standard listed "spells" from the book. If you're an Adept, you need to have a character Aspect that reflects that: <i>Greedy Plutomancer</i> or <i>Self-Destructive Epideromancer</i> or something; something you invoke to cast spells but can be compelled against you to show how messed up your life is. Y'know how in the game fiction the Adepts are always hit with magickal backlash in the form of strange coincidences and chance encounters? That's totally a compel, right there, right? Compels probably do this better than the core UA system does, which relies on the GM to somehow figure out the destiny/coincidence factor that magick/the Invisible Clergy brings with them.<br/><br/>If we get PC Adepts and need to start dealing with Charges and whatnot, we'll probably have to come up with a crunchier system to take care of it, but for NPCs its enough to just say "we gotta stop this Urbanomancer from getting his hands on the city planning department's budget or Bad Things will happen." I'm not sure we would care about tracking individual Charges; I think Fate would handle that better by using Aspects called <i>Slightly Charged, Significantly Charged, Dangerously Charged</i> or something. You could invoke them to help your spell go off and if you succeed with style, maybe you wouldn't drop a Charge level. <br/><br/>Anyway, it's been crazy fun so far and I really like the new Fate Core rules. I think they do a great job with the occult underground setting because they mimic genre whereas the UA rules are very practical simulation most of the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422455/#Comment_422455" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-05T09:17:57+00:00" title="October  5, 2013  9:17AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the game quite a bit.<br/><br/>I like how densely packed the main book is with great campaign ideas and adventure nuggets.

There are some really intense scenarios in the <b>Weep</b> book, though, that really hammer home how dark and scary the game can be. By and large, though, the published scenarios don't give enough credit to the game, they're also pretty railroady.

Every weird creature and demonic entity you might encounter is human, or was human once. The modules are underwhelming but worth strip-mining for ideas and characters, they've got some really good ones.  And Jail Break is said to be a great one-shot scenario, but I've never played it.  <br/><br/>Also, some of the faction books are pretty great sources.  Basically, the scarier and more shit-together a faction looks in UA, the less idea they have of what's <i>really</i> going on. UA really has a beatdown 70's-era paranoid post-hippy sensibility to me, maybe from the Philip K. Dick/Tim Powers influence.  <br/><br/>Scrape, have you written up any of your FATE conversion stuff?  I'd really like to see how a UA character looks in FATE.  I've wanted to run a Mak Attax game for ages (but with Starbucks instead of McDonald's because I'm scared of clowns), but I've never felt quite ready to run it.  How do you handle the Avatar/Adept magic stuff?  The taboos and channels would work as Aspects, but I'm not sure how I'd handle spells or charges. <br/>EDIT: Oops, missed your earlier post where you talk about that stuff.

It's fun to play with cherries (special perks you get on 11, 22, etc rolls), and the mechanic where you can reverse the order of digits in a percentile roll is pretty interesting--but all those mechanical bits don't really contribute to play much.<br/><br/>OTOH, the background is great; the concept that one can only gain supernatural power by either obsessing on a false logical model for the universe which turns you into an obvious weirdo (you can only see the real world when you're drunk; sex should always be scripted, life is risk, so you should risk everything, every time) or by turning yoruself into something fundamentally inhuman is a great one, that immediately lends itself to background and story ideas.  And it did use a lot of the same innovations that Over the Edge started, like free-form skills and the like.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422555/#Comment_422555" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-07T12:42:53+00:00" title="October  7, 2013 12:42PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The bundle of holding for UA just got a new lease on life for another 30 hours.

I ran it once at short notice for a group of mostly-strangers, which was ideal, really. <br/>Aside from "Jailbreak" and some of <i>To Go</i>, I would have to concur that the published scenarios are no great shakes. <br/><br/>Having said that, in my experience the game tended to become very player-driven very easily, so this wasn't a huge weakness for UA as a game line. <br/><br/>Mechanically speaking, I am a fan of the Madness Meters. As for the rest, I'd always run the game with the rules as-is, but they are not so outstanding that I ever think "hey, I should convert this to Unknown Armies rules". <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422614/#Comment_422614" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-08T21:39:42+00:00" title="October  8, 2013  9:39PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That madness metre keeps me awake at night, with its terrible beauty and inelegance. <br/><br/>Four tracks, one soul.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zydake" title="zydake"><img alt="zydake" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nAK5WMQP5MDFD.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zydake">zydake</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422623/#Comment_422623" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-09T06:14:32+00:00" title="October  9, 2013  6:14AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I own the German version.

And of course it is very much a piece with that late-90s White Wolfy style where setting detail is prioritized above plainspoken advice about how best to USE that material, and the modules definitely don't help either-- some of them are pretty interesting, and I've had good results running them as one-shots, but I don't think they work as installments of an ongoing campaign or as hints to what such a campaign would look like (that said, I never read To Go, which I think is supposed to be that campaign).<br/><br/>I never had trouble figuring out what to do with UA, but then when that game came out I was basically completely in its target audience; I was reading a lot of millennial conspiracy theories, apocalyptica, Forteana, occultism, and all manner of other stuff Grant Morrison and Ken Hite write about (and in fact I bought UA specifically on Hite's recommendation), so it wasn't a new crazy thing to wrap my head around, but an RPG specifically tailored to my interests.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares" title="Ricardo Tavares"><img alt="Ricardo Tavares" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/695/nIETVNBV4ZU51.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares">Ricardo Tavares</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422918/#Comment_422918" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-15T11:36:07+00:00" title="October 15, 2013 11:36AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I remember that the 1st Edition blew my mind, but I never got to play it.

It was one of the last books in the line, IIRC. \n<blockquote><br/>Also the way they described those who were searching for a specific actress on video to me came across like a plot that I had to follow.<br/><br/>And recurring NPCs between published adventures (Jesus, the ambulance driver)\u2026<br/>it was just hard to get what was fiction, and what was game.</blockquote>\nFair enough, although I find this hard to understand. <br/>All this stuff was explicitly laid out as elements you could choose to use or not use, and I'm not sure your examples are metaplot. "There are some guys looking for the video tapes" is setting info; there are no fixed events there. <br/><br/>Having said that, I remember there was a lot of confusion on the issue as to whether it was canon that the Naked Goddess had been the avatar of a particular thing. It was mentioned a few times that those in-character letters were just speculation on the part of the (fictional) writer, but that speculation seemed to gain a lot of traction as the Official Truth. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424665/#Comment_424665" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-23T10:43:58+00:00" title="November 23, 2013 10:43AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just reread the two books I have, Weep and 2nd core.<br/>The mak attax stuff was in the intro to Green Glass Grail but I don't know what it refers to. You're right, it could not have been To Go.<br/><br/>Actually, I had never read through Weep before. I've hanged on to it because I need A Few Of My Favorite Things as a reminder of GM nadir. But now that I've read Garden Full of Weeds, I'm considering throwing the book away. It is too gruesome.<br/><br/>I just think the game and GM style advocated really is the opposite of what I want from a game. GM is told to keep wound points hidden... Many of the adventures are A) linear (not all of them, but many of them) and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> hard to see how they are derived from the ruled/gameplay.<br/><br/>It just seems to me that the "system", such as it is, is "GMs, make up weird shit and let your players encounter it. Here is a grab-bag of weird stuff to start you off. Players, when you do stuff (such as fight or use path or spells), make rolls. You must obey."<br/>I also read the Tynes design notes. They are very settings first.<br/><br/>To me, the gameability is low. It's hard tl create a story, you're more "along for the ride". It does emphasize some hard choices for players occasionally, which is good, but with so much obfuscation a lot of the choices are shots in the dark.<br/><br/>Tynes once created an insightful and fun exercise called "Power Kill". Well, fun to read, not to actually try to do. It's basically pointing out the murder-hobo:ness of its contemporaries. I like it, it raised good questions.<br/>I'd like to create a similar exercise called "Power Trip", for the GM instead of for the players, on how GM-centric the games were back then.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424666/#Comment_424666" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-23T10:45:36+00:00" title="November 23, 2013 10:45AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's just so much of the coolness of the setting that happens only behind the scenes.

It's just that I think that almost every singe one of those GMs are also part of the (larger) set of "People who can run a good game from any novel, sourcebook or worldbook".<br/><br/>Either they went contrary to the GM rules/advice, or, more likely, they have a group of players who enjoy a participationist or illusionist play.<br/><br/>In the vein of Story Games' focus on AP experiences, I can only say that as psyched I was for the game when reading the rumors and "classes", when at the actual table it was my worst GMing experience yet and still a source of shame and regret, because of the very visible "rails".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18868/do-i-want-unknown-armies" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18868/do-i-want-unknown-armies" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18868/do-i-want-unknown-armies/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F18868%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F18868%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
