So figure out some way that the players themselves could let the GM know that they are doing something in order to get Inspiration. (And then tell us about it \u2014 still trying to find best practices here.)<br/><br/>Another thing, since one of the new \u201cthree pillars of D&amp;D\u201d is exploration, my suggestion is to have interesting locations and situations prepped that the PCs can explore.

First session was spent making characters, figuring out the rules, introducing the scenario, fighting some battles, and everyone made it to level 2.<br/><br/>First, I really wish inspiration was written more like it is in DW where you have a "when you do something" you get inspiration, rather than just a statement of belief or philosophy. I'm totally lost in handling it. I'm considering going through all of my player's BIFTs and re-writing them in the "when you do it, do it" fashion. What do you think?<br/><br/>Second, the new death &amp; dying rules are brilliant. Even in the first session we had an incredibly tense situation where the life of a PC hung in the balance of a single die roll. It was much more tense than usual because the player rolled a 1 on their death saving throw (it's a success based system where you make a DC 10 unmodified save each round you spend dying, if you make it to 3 cumulative successes first you live, if you make it to 3 cumulative fails first you die, on a 20 you can get up with 1 hp, on a 1 you get 2 failures). This system is incredibly simple and makes going down in combat dramatic as hell.<br/><br/>Third, there was much confusion about charging and flanking. Our group spent at least 20 minutes hunting through the book for rules on these basic maneuvers from 3rd edition. Eventually I (temporarily) house ruled that charging is a +1 attack, -1 AC. With flanking I'm not so sure how I want to handle it. It's definitely something some of the players are interested in and not overly complex since we already use minis, so I'll need to come up with something.<br/><br/>Fourth, character generation is fast and easy. Loving it. It takes about half the amount of time as 3rd edition and forces people to think about their character's beliefs and values more than just picking an alignment.<br/><br/>Fifth, I'm enjoying the adventure design of HotDQ. It's highly modular and leaves lots of blanks for the GM to fill in. It doesn't seem to be heavy on railroading (yet, more commentary on this to come as the campaign progresses).<br/><br/>Overall, it was a great experience and it seemed like my players had a lot of fun as well.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe" title="Caoimhe"><img alt="Caoimhe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe">Caoimhe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438190/#Comment_438190" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-09T06:30:25+00:00" title="September  9, 2014  6:30AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Charging and flanking are out of the game. Neither concept exists in 5e and would have to be houseruled to be added back in.<br/><br/>For BIFTs, it's entirely unclear how the statements are supposed to interact with the DM giving out Inspiration. I've settled on having a stack of inspiration tokens in the middle and letting players grab them on the honor system whenever they play to one of their BIFTs.<br/><br/>I'm not that keen on HotDQ, I think it's a bizarre combination of sandbox-style and railroading-style that works poorly.

It stands for (Personality) Traits, Ideals, Bonds, and Flaws. You get 2 traits (one positive, one negative) one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. Unless I missed it, there are no rules so far for changing them in the course of play.<br/><br/>It really is too bad that (unless I missed it) the Player's Handbook didn't include better advice about writing these traits. In Story Game circles, we have years of accumulated experience and best practices from games like Burning Wheel (BITs) and Dungeon World (bonds). For example, there are no examples in the new Player's Handbook about having your bond be to another PC. Whereas for someone who's played TSOY or Dungeon World, that would be an obvious choice. If everyone creates characters together, as <a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">@Deliverator</a> suggested, you can go even further. For example, if my flaw is "I hate it when anyone tries to control me," your flaw could be "I'm a control freak." But making characters together is, in my experience at least, not necessarily a common practice in most D&amp;D groups. In most of the groups I've personally played in, everyone kind of creates characters separately, and the characters come into the game with no relationship with each other whatsoever.<br/><br/>Also, a lot of the examples in the book are just pretty weak. I don't have it in front of me right now, but having a bond to your father's axe is a lot less interesting than having a bond to your NPC father, which is in turn less interesting than a bond to your PC brother. You'd think that a book called the "Player's Handbook" might include better advice about creating interesting, dynamic characters who work well with the other characters in the group. But, alas. I wonder whether the designers really have a solid grasp of how to make these mechanics work well, and just didn't do a great job of explaining it--or whether they just kind of don't get it. Even the combination of traits, ideal, bond, and flaw seems a little bit arbitrary compared to more tightly designed mechanics like BITs in Burning Wheel (Beliefs, Instincts, and Traits all do different things in BW, whereas TIBFs all do the same thing). In conclusion, I love that D&amp;D now has a story-game-like mechanic, but I worry that it seems kind of weak and poorly implemented.<br/><br/>I would love to have a more detailed, analytical discussion of the Inspiration mechanics in D&amp;D--perhaps that would merit a separate thread?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438348/#Comment_438348" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-14T19:49:00+00:00" title="September 14, 2014  7:49PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What <a href="/forums/profile/kurisu">@kurisu</a> said.

WotC's Mike Mearls says "The new release date for the Dungeon Master's Guide is December 9th. For those stores that take part in our early release program, the book goes on sale November 28th." The delay is due to "an entire additional cycle of design and editing to ensure that the books were as close to perfect as humanly possible."</blockquote>\nAnd this today, from Mearls:\n<blockquote>Will the DMG have suplementary material on how to handle Inspiration and how to better tie BIFTS between PCs and to a setting? <b>it does go into more depth on inspiration, believe it does talk about BIFTS and how to use them</b></blockquote>\nWhich is pretty non-specific.

For me the DMG is the only book of that edition I own.

I saw Mearls calling them BIFTs today but that was in response to someone else also using the term BIFTs. I was aware of Burning Wheel's BITs and I saw the post on this forum (I guess it <em>was</em> you, Deliverator) that coined \u201cBIFTs\u201d but I have had a hard time keeping them in order already. I was calling them T/I/B/Fs \u2014 to imply that they worked similarly to each other (unlike BW\u2019s BITs) \u2014 but I think I\u2019m going to drop the slashes.<br/>I have bad eyesight (it came suddenly, after I got a vitreous detachment earlier this year) and I want to know that the third one down is the bond, the fourth one down is the flaw and so one.<br/><br/>Honestly I wish D&amp;D would\u2019ve had a collective name for them.<br/>Oh, I just checked \u2014 the PHB calls them Personal Characteristics. I don\u2019t remember that from v0.1 of the Basic PDF, but I re-checked and it\u2019s there. What do you think? A mouthful... and a little vague and hard to remember. But it\u2019s there.<br/><br/>ETA: reading some more posts in this thread. I keep flinching whenever I see them called \u201cBIFTs\u201d.

When I heard it, the first example that came to my mind was GURPS 3e, where the GM should give out points \u201cfor good roleplaying\u201d. \u201cJudging\u201d party games mechanics like in Apple to Apple or Say Anything also catch my ire and is part of why I love Dixit so much more.<br/>Of course, there is still going to be judgement calls. But it\u2019s easier to make judgement calls about the more specific and precise<br/>\u201cDid you follow a characteristic and it had negative consequences for your character or the group\u201d<br/>vs a more general superset of<br/>\u201cDid you stay true to your character\u201d.<br/>I\u2019m not an acting judge, but I think I can tell (most of the time) when someone is making a choice in spite of so-called \u201cmeta game benefits\u201d.<br/><br/>When I DM:d it last friday, it was with a group new to me at a small local con. One of the players was a heavy \u201cstory-gamer\u201d (I think they read this forum occasionally) whose favorite games are all powered by the Apocalypse, but who wasn\u2019t familiar with 5e yet. That player looked at their flaw \u201cDespite my best efforts, I\u2019m still unreliable to my friends\u201d and asked me and the group: \u201cAbout playstyle \u2014 how much focus is there on \u2018completing the quest\u2019? That\u2019s to say, is it frowned upon to follow this trait, or should we play on them hard?\u201d<br/><br/>It felt great to be able to answer: \u201cFirst of all, there is no \u2018quest\u2019. Just explore the world. Second, as for the flaw, play it hard. You\u2019ll get compensated with advantages later\u201d and I explained the inspiration rule and ended up with \u201cThe game rewards you for being true to your character\u201d. Everyone ended up playing hard to their TIBFs/characteristics/BIFTs and the inspiration was flying and I as DM had a great time.<br/><br/>One of the first times inspiration was awarded, this player shouted \u201cHello\u201d into a dungeon (leading into them getting attacked), claimed it as a use of \u201cDespite my best efforts, I\u2019m still unreliable to my friends\u201d and asked for inspiration, which I awarded. It\u2019s still a judgement call between following that particular flaw vs general stupidity \u2014 even an unreliable person might be cautious in the face of a dangerous and weird looking cave (they had found skulls), and even a usually reliable person might make that mistake for the sake of curiosity \u2014 but it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s a choice made with the purpose of being true to the characteristics rather than the purpose of \u201cquest success\u201d.<br/><br/>Also I wanted the inspiration to get going, and it worked. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> If one player is doing it, more will start doing it.<br/>5e is cementing itself as my favorite game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438409/#Comment_438409" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-17T02:33:24+00:00" title="September 17, 2014  2:33AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2014 5:49AM by Andy.">edited September 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Inspiration is <b>Fan Mail</b> from Primetime Adventures. I don't think it needs to be tied back into the whosiwhatsits of whatever situation created said inspiration. <b>The player role-played well; they get a reward. This reward the player can use whenever they want.</b> It's not a reward tied to the player's skillful manipulation of the elements present in a scene (ala rewards in FATE), it's just a reward for stepping up. Sounds perfect to me as-is.<br/><br/>Funny story: <b>Everyone</b> with game familiarity in Japan (including the group responsible for the translations of the last two generations of D&amp;D in Japan) thought inspiration was totally lifted/pulled from Japanese RPG Tenra Bansho Zero. Message boards and game store tables were flooded with people slowly reading through the book in English, and going, "Waitaminute, this 'Inspiration' thing is basically Aiki chits from Tenra Bansho, then? WTF?" (^.^)<br/><br/>(PTA isn't known in Japan. Well, <b><i>yet</i></b> anyway)<br/><br/>EDIT: Forgot to say, since I'm not here as often: 5E is awesome. It's not left my side for more than a day or two since I got back from GenCon. Still digesting a lot, and fighting my brain, which can't decide what I want to play first (Warlock! No, Assassin Thief! No, wait, Martial Fighter! etc).

Good catch. But in the long post I wrote (started a new thread), I called them \u201ccharacteristics\u201d throughout.<br/><br/>Instead of a narrow definition of trouble, here\u2019s what I mean:<br/>\u201cWhen your TIBF/BIFT/PC/characteristic makes you do something that you would not do if that characteristic wasn\u2019t there.\u201d<br/><br/>Like, any player when faced with a king might choose to flatter them because they think that it\u2019ll get them \u201cahead in the game\u201d. Whereas a player with the ideal \u201cThus Always to Tyrants\u201d might be hostile to the king and not caring about what will get them \u201cahead in the game\u201d. The ideal might color the entire interaction but not lead to any real trouble. I\u2019d reward them with inspiration even if there was no trouble.<br/><br/>It\u2019s been common in every group I\u2019ve ever played that people do sub-optimal things because \u201cthat\u2019s what my character would do\u201d. That\u2019s not new. But now the game explicitly rewards it and encourages it.<br/><br/>That\u2019s why I was so glad that the player last friday used the phrase \u201ccomplete the quest\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s something that\u2019s important in some play groups but the opposite for me. \u201cQuest completion\u201d can\u2019t come before what makes sense for the character\u2019s true heart.<br/><br/><small>Because then I as DM would have to write quests and I don\u2019t want to bother with that, it\u2019s hard enough work to build a world for them to run around in.</small> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares" title="Ricardo Tavares"><img alt="Ricardo Tavares" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/695/nIETVNBV4ZU51.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares">Ricardo Tavares</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438421/#Comment_438421" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-17T06:39:49+00:00" title="September 17, 2014  6:39AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Trying to keep it RAW, the "How to Play" section only asks for a statement of intent from the players, which probably means something like "I have this BIFT, therefore I want to do this." Besides describing what they want to do, it is implied in "Gaining Inspiration" that the players may portray their characters in a compelling way which probably relates to the "Social interaction" paragraph wich "features the adventurers talking to someone" or it may just be a matter of how the player colors the perception of his or her character (ex: by keeping a diary between sessions, by singing when his bard sings in-character, etc).

I'm digging it.<br/><br/><a href="http://githyankidiaspora.wordpress.com/2014/08/15/daydreaming-about-a-hexcrawl/" rel="nofollow">Here's the premis</a>e. The characters are:<br/><br/>Drow/Monk/Acolyte<br/>Drow/Rogue/Scholar<br/>Quaggoth/Ranger/Folk Hero<br/>Orc/Fighter/Gladiator<br/>Dwarf/Cleric/Acolye<br/><br/>Last night's game we had to make a character, so we only had time to interact with one random encounter - a caravan from the Dwarven merchant-ruled city of Vault. I rolled 7 carts and 17 guards along with the dwarven cart drivers.<br/><br/>The players stealthed into camp and stole a few books (The Axe Bible and Flesh, a cookbook written by ghouls for human flesh) created by an off-the-cuff random tome making table. That was about all we had time for.<br/><br/>The game before that the game was dominated by a random encounter with a scholar and then a Ghoul Knight and its two human squares. When they realized that they weren't going to defeat the knight (disadvantage dice during daylight is rough) and they hoofed it. When the knight took the scholar back to its keep, they took a squire hostage by catching it in a pit trap and doing a hostage swap.<br/><br/>It was slick work.<br/><br/>But I have no idea how to work with the experience points. Do I reward them with XP for running, for rescuing the scholar, for stealing some books from the shadows?<br/><br/>Thoughts appreciated.\ufeff                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438427/#Comment_438427" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-17T07:48:10+00:00" title="September 17, 2014  7:48AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neat, Judd.<br/><br/>I think the XP question is basically the "when should characters level up" question, and with your group, it looks like it'd be fine to level them whenever it seems like the right thing to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438428/#Comment_438428" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-17T07:52:30+00:00" title="September 17, 2014  7:52AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2014 7:54AM by Judd.">edited September 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Neat, Judd.<br/><br/>I think the XP question is basically the "when should characters level up" question, and with your group, it looks like it'd be fine to level them whenever it seems like the right thing to do.</blockquote>\nThank you for the response, Roger. That is kind of unsatisfying, though. I want some kind of guidelines for rewarding the solving of monster-dungeon-problems.

Many things are improvements but XP is really the biggest negative. You get XP for killing monsters and vague story things now? Uh... clearer rules, please! Mearls has promised an \u201cXP for gold\u201d rule that\u2019s more similar to the way the basic-style D&amp;D games work.<br/>Failing that, <a href="http://walkingmind.evilhat.com/2011/10/05/roleplay-and-exploration-rewards/" rel="nofollow">Rob Donaghue has some ideas</a> that he wrote up for 4e originally. I just posted that link in the SWN house rules thread, too. It\u2019s a good idea.<br/><br/>I\u2019ve found myself handing out xp as we go instead of calculating it all in the end, it\u2019s easier for me as a DM. Our Lab Lord DM used to do it at the end of the session but I always had a hard time concentrating then. People had one foot out the door, too, tired after a long game and perhaps pushing time limits and other engagements.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438433/#Comment_438433" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-17T08:18:36+00:00" title="September 17, 2014  8:18AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd say reward them for anything that made the story interesting and/or opened a path to a new adventure. They should still gain some xp for running to fight another day, though not neccesarily as much as if they had won the encounter. More importantly, take in account how fast would you like their characters to progress.<br/><br/>On an almost separate note, I was looking on advice about encounter design and found <a href="http://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/2050/roleplaying-games/revisiting-encounter-design" rel="nofollow">an interesting article in the Alexandrian</a>. It's actually about 3.5, but I really think I'll use this instead of the actual 5e encounter design rules, which aren't bad per se, but I'd really like to try a different feeling for my campaign.<br/><br/>In short, the article says a lot of people misread the encounter design advice for 3.5 which stated that there should be variety of CR for encounters, as in making 30% of the campaign encounters 2 levels below the PCs, 50% at the same level, 15% 2 levels higher and 5% 5+ levels higher. Probably this would have worked better if the editors offered this as an optional way for DMing and stating that before using it, DMs should totally warn the players <span style="text-decoration: underline;">before starting the campaign</span> that the encounters WILL BE unbalanced, that he will be clear about how unbalanced and to which side when the encounter starts, and that XP will be awarded even in the case they run from a lethal encounter or otherwise avoid combat.<br/><br/>I'm aware of the problems of unbalanced encounters. With a CR lower than the party and no DM tricks to make the encounter "interesting" the battle ends prematurely. But that's okey if the idea is that adventurers will fight more than one encounter per day. And if not then, when do they get to show off and be badass? Of course, there's also the chance they find more than they can chew. Players might still think they can beat anything you put in front of them if you've put too much care before on balancing encounters, so that's why I think a proper warning signal from the DM is neccessary, both before starting the campaign and before the encounter.

It's the worst part of 5e, hands down. The DMG will have some alternatives but won't be available for a few months.<br/><br/>Here is my suggestion. Ditch the 5e XP system entirely and replace it with something closer to Dungeon World's.<br/><br/>At the end of the session, answer the following questions:<br/><br/>-Did the group defeat a significant threat?<br/>-Did they find out something new about the world?<br/>-Did they acquire a worthwhile treasure / magic item?<br/><br/>For each "yes," everyone gets 1 XP.<br/><br/>Then, individually:<br/>-Did you resolve one of your BIFTs? If yes, get 1 XP and rewrite that BIFT to reflect the new fictional situation.<br/><br/>Level up every... 7 XP or so seems about right, eyeballing it, if you're okay with people leveling up once every two-four sessions.<br/><br/>There are ways of making this basic framework more interesting. For example, you could make the XP for defeating a threat (which would include outsmarting it, BTW) = its CR, and then have escalating costs for leveling up (probably just 7/8/9...). You could also add, "Did you make a new enemy which will be a persistent threat going forward?" And make that worth CR+1. That incentivizes the PCs not to one-shot the villain. :-)<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438454/#Comment_438454" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-17T12:06:10+00:00" title="September 17, 2014 12:06PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They're Inspirions, the carriers of the charge of Inspiration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares" title="Ricardo Tavares"><img alt="Ricardo Tavares" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/695/nIETVNBV4ZU51.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares">Ricardo Tavares</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438463/#Comment_438463" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-17T14:25:49+00:00" title="September 17, 2014  2:25PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Which page are you referring to, Ricardo?</blockquote>The compelling part is in page 35, Gaining Inspiration.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438471/#Comment_438471" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-17T16:52:58+00:00" title="September 17, 2014  4:52PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You could also add, "Did you make a new enemy which will be a persistent threat going forward?"
