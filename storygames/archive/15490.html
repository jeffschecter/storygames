Maybe I'd do it just a straight situation of humans and imperial powers and the nastiness of war, though I've thought of making the city a dwarven hold that's fallen under the dominion of men, and who use the greed and godlessness of the dwarves as an excuse to sack the hold of its treasures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351271/#Comment_351271" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-12T12:26:58+00:00" title="December 12, 2011 12:26PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 13, 2011 11:44AM by johnzo.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anyone playing medieval fantasy would do well to read <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A Distant Mirror</span> by Barbara Tuchman.<br/><br/>It's a wonderful history of 14th-century France which integrates the big picture very nicely with the small picture.

They trade, and now they both have some salt and some meat) is false. Market capitalism is a social construct, and one that appears much later than trade through governing bodies (ie caveman C lords over cavemen A and B, taking away their salt and meat and redistributing it in a relatively fair manner).<br/><br/>I'm not a historian or an economist, and I've no idea just how historically accurate Polyani's ideas are; however, the book does offer a wealth of small details that are very useful when running a game set in a pre-capitalist society, and offer some good ways to make Ye Olde Adventure Supply Shoppe or the Big City Bazaar a fundamentally different experience than the modern shopping experience.<br/><br/>I've recently used it to model the economy of the city-states in my Apocalypse World campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351327/#Comment_351327" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-13T04:40:45+00:00" title="December 13, 2011  4:40AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 16, 2011 9:14AM by Johnstone.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mease19</cite>Also, consider:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Generations-History-Americas-Future-1584/dp/0688119123/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1323720131&amp;sr=1-1" rel="nofollow">Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584 to 2069</a></blockquote>\nI second this one.

For some reason I was looking at their later book that was just on America's 13th generation (the name they use for "Gen X," or people born 1961-1981), which was called "13th Gen" (did this influence Vampire? dunno. The comic Gen13? probably). Either it was in the bibliography of some other book I had read, or I found it on the shelves at the local library (I used to scour them pretty thoroughly back in the day), and it caught my eye. I'm pretty certain nobody recommended it to me, though, although I could also have found out about it from a magazine article. Anyway, I thought is was interesting, so I checked out Generations.<br/><br/>One thing the book did was explain each generation's opinions about generational theory. I found that they explained my own attitudes and opinions very, very well. In like 1998, not long after I read it, I was explaining it to a guy I was in a band with, who was born c.1971. He said "I don't believe in different generations." So I read what the book said his 13th Gen attitude would be and why he wouldn't believe in generations and he said "Hey! That's exactly what I believe! What the hell book is this?"<br/><br/>So there's a funny anecdote for you, since I don't remember the real answer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351406/#Comment_351406" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-13T16:02:22+00:00" title="December 13, 2011  4:02PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anything by Harvey Pekar, but especially his slice of life stuff.

David Havey makes reading it bearable. But what's really, really spooky about it, as much as academically I've had to wrestle ceaselessly with various strains of Marxism, is how he explains capitalism and things like the current financial and cultural problems we're facing, like two hundred years ago. <br/><br/>If you haven't read any Marx, you have no idea how markets operate. None whatsoever. Literally less that zero.<br/><br/>Also, similarly, if you have any interest in the operations of power within society, you should read Discipline and Punish by Michel Foucault. Like with Marx, I consider those who've not read Foucault and study government and power naive at best. <br/><br/>Neither of these authors are without their faults, but they are absolutely essential and critical introductions to thinking about the two largest social forces: the State and the Market.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351423/#Comment_351423" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-13T22:41:29+00:00" title="December 13, 2011 10:41PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A second recommendation for <i>The World Without Us</i>.<br/><br/>Also, <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i>, and <i>Collapse</i>, both by Jared Diamond.

Long time no hear. How are you doing my friend?<br/><br/>Let's say you picked a really interesting topic here. Two books immediately pop in my mind.<br/><br/>The first is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Silk-Road-Thousand-Years-Heart/dp/0520243404/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1323947900&amp;sr=1-4" rel="nofollow">The Silk Road: Two Thousand Years in the Heart of Asia</a> a book that demonstrates how you don't have to search for incredible settings in fiction, because human history has much more than any fictional setting could provide. The geographical and storical setting of the Silk Road is my favorite, and seeing a game about it would be just great.<br/><br/>Also, how about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/1421-Year-China-Discovered-America/dp/0061564893/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1323948082&amp;sr=1-1" rel="nofollow">1421: The Year China Discovered America</a> that's a very interesting history that has only recently been uncovered. Imagine, Cristoforo Colombo seems to have been aware of the existence of the 'new continent', and had been navigating with chinese maps!<br/><br/>Then since you are a perfect italian speaker, and since your country has a shared history with Venice, you could find a book like <a href="http://www.amazon.it/servizi-Venezia-Spionaggio-controspionaggio-Serenissima/dp/8856501643/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1323948211&amp;sr=1-1" rel="nofollow">I servizi segreti di Venezia. Spionaggio e controspionaggio ai tempi della Serenissima</a> quite interesting.<br/>Imagine. CIA, KGB, Stasi, Gestapo, Mossad, you name it. The basis of espionage and the very concept of secret services has been laid out by Venice, and all modern intelligence agencies are based upon that very model.<br/><br/>Cheers!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351770/#Comment_351770" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-17T03:57:48+00:00" title="December 17, 2011  3:57AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thirty Years A Detective</span>, Allan Pinkerton's roundup of property crime in 1800s America.
