I'd be interested to hear them.</blockquote>\nNot in the sense of trying it and failing -- mostly I know it would be a problem for me so I steer clear of the situation. I tend to be a bit obsessive about things, so I usually get really hung up on not wanting to copy something exactly, but also not making a change merely for the sake of distancing the story from the original (This time, the Dark Lord <i>isn't</i> in Mordor!), and those dual constraints I put on myself create such a shadow over everything that I can't get comfortable enough to contribute to a fresh story. I think it's certainly possible to do other types of stories in the Middle Earth setting, but I personally would find it really hard to do a Middle Earth story that's of the same scope as Lord of the Rings without doing either Lord of the Rings or a story that was only meaningful as a commentary on Lord of the Rings. (I could probably go on and on about this kind of stuff, since I though about it a lot when I was trying to capture the spirit of Tolkien in my own game, but I don't want to derail Zac's thread).<br/>to which Hans replied:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hans c-o</cite>If you want to go on and on about it, I'm all ears for another thread!</blockquote>\nSo, here's a thread to talk about the existing, iconic stories and how they impact efforts to create new stories in their settings.<br/><br/>I originally started thinking deeply about this topic when I decided to design a game that captured the spirit of an Epic Fantasy story, which for me means capturing the spirit of Tolkien's <i>Lord of the Rings</i>. One observation I made is that many fantasy stories copy the superficial details of Tolkien (there are orcs! and elves! and dwarves!) but don't really capture the heart of the stories. The other observation is that when people talk about how they would game in Middle Earth, the only ideas that ever sound compelling to me are small, limited scope stories -- anything grander always gives me the feeling that it's a cheap knock-off of LOTR instead of a compelling story that I'd want to be a part of. Since I also enjoy other Epic Fantasy stories besides LOTR, this led me to the conclusion: if I want to do a story that captures the spirit of Lord of the Rings, the first thing I needed to do is get out of Middle Earth. I think part of this is because of the Epic Fantasy nature of LOTR: Epic Fantasy is always world-changing, so the story has a strong connection to the world it takes place in. Once I start seeing the concrete details that are strongly associated with the world from the iconic story, I start thinking in terms of how the new story relates to the original story. Is this guy the Gandalf of the story? Is this the part where the Fellowship breaks? Is this what the story would be like if Boromir was a different character? If the new story and the original have structural similarities as well as similarities in the details then I get so bogged down by the constant compare-and-contrast that I can't engage with the "new" story. So, based on the hypothesis that every Epic Fantasy story needs its own unique world, I decided that in my game <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/final-hour-of-a-storied-age/" rel="nofollow">Final Hour of a Storied Age</a> creating a fresh setting for each story arc would be vitally important to the game (the game makes sure other stuff, like plot structure, is consistent for different story arcs to make sure the Epic Fantasy happens).<br/><br/>I've got another example, too: I recently GMed a series of playtests of <a href="http://atthetablegames.com/?p=71" rel="nofollow">Boarsdraft</a>, which is basically Harry Potter with the serial numbers filed off (I released the AP's on my podcast <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/podcast/2011/06/30/episode-30-boarsdraft-playtest-1a/" rel="nofollow">Designer vs. Reality</a>, if anyone wants to listen). Although I'm a big Harry Potter fan, I could never really muster the enthusiasm for actually gaming in the setting from the books. But Boarsdraft really captured my imagination because the creative tension of establishing a setting that was <i>like</i> Harry Potter but <i>wasn't</i> Harry Potter really worked for me. It was like creative permission to create characters and situations that were commentary on the original: how is this headmaster like or unlike Dumbledore? How is this school like or unlike Hogwarts? I found it really compelling to think in those terms and a fun way to approach the game. Based on some observations from the playtest, Josh released a <a href="http://atthetablegames.com/?p=86" rel="nofollow">revised version</a> of the rules, and although both of the other participants in the playtest expressed some interest in trying them out, I'm finding the thought of starting fresh with the new rules a lot more daunting than my first experience: now I'd be thinking mostly about what I'm reusing (or intentionally altering) from the "original" Boarsdraft that I've already experienced. Basically, now I'd be suffering from some suffocating creative constraints I'd place on myself about not wanting to repeat what I did the first time but also not changing things merely for the sake of changing them -- I'd constantly be second-guessing my creative decisions.<br/><br/>I'm also tempted to talk about my opinions on Tolkien's somewhat weird relationship with settings and stories, but I don't want this post to go on too long without getting some other people's thoughts on the thread topic.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347758/#Comment_347758" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-03T11:24:53+00:00" title="November  3, 2011 11:24AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dan Maruschak</cite>I'm also tempted to talk about my opinions on Tolkien's somewhat weird relationship with settings and stories, but I don't want this post to go on too long without getting some other people's thoughts on the thread topic.</blockquote>\nPlease do that somewhere.

We had been talking about amateur Japanese RPGs and how many/most of them use an existing property (such as Bleach or some other anime/manga) as the setting, as opposed to the American indy gaming scene where everybody strives for originality. His reply was that I was thinking about Japanese games in a very American way, and that it's not that Japanese games lack originality, but that shared universes allow for experiences to be easily shared and easy to communicate. If you create a game in a known setting, it's much easier to get people to play, to immerse themselves in the world, and contribute to the common narrative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nocker" title="Nocker"><img alt="Nocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://sites.google.com/site/angrynocker/_/rsrc/1306682518924/jdr/images.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nocker">Nocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348437/#Comment_348437" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-09T07:32:19+00:00" title="November  9, 2011  7:32AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, it can be really good, since you share all these little references, and you can jump right into action (like "I'll be the Jedi!" and "Let's go into Moria kicks some Goblins' butts!").<br/>But :<br/>1) if you want to have heroics deeds, you must play in a time and place where no heroes are currently, or they'll overshadow your players actions (and you'll have to deal with the occasional "I kill Gollum!" and its consequences). And this is the last thing you want, because, all the setting the "normal" players know is the time and place you see in the story, where and when heroes do their heroics deeds. The more you take freedom from the story constraints of the source, the less you benefit from the common knowledge. Starting a game with Men of Osgiliath, but 200 years before Bilbo arrival is somewhat free from story constraints, but who knows anything about Osgiliath society and background beyond a couple of names and the mountains surrounding ?<br/>2) When a player take the least movement outside of the canon, for purpose of free creativity, insolence or for the ignorance of a detail widely known, you'll run into a pretty incomfortable moment where the players who know will undo what the player has just done, because it really breaks their immersion in this setting (and they might be right. Maybe all the boat builders belong to a specific guild with a rich history, and one player didn't know it, and the setting falls apart if his character is a dwarf boat builder). And the first player can be very defensive, after seeing his creation negated, and the social context will degrade after each of these. It happened to me after trying Misery Bubblegum, by Tony Lower Basch, in the Harry Potter Verse. I didn't remember that catching the Golden Snitch make you win the game automaticly. I was thinking of a more moderated consequence, like a dozen points, or winning a set. And after a negotiation in which I accepted the compromise that a opponent catch the Golden Snitch, I was really surprised that the game was finished, and would not have made this decision, knowing it.<br/>3) when a setting is unknown to all, everybody listen your explanations with equal attention. When there is diversity in knowledge (so big, sometimes, that one player knows pretty nothing, and another saw five times the movies, reads the books, and has subscribed to the RSS of the WikiVerse), they can be an akward moment where the explanation bores somones and goes too fast for other. If you announce a game of Bleach RPG and the players have unequal knowledge, there will be a shitty first hour.<br/><br/>Worst, trying to evade these problems by going flexible with the setting pretty much miss the point, because you'll have the flaws 1) and a litthe bit of 3), but the absence of problem 2) will be balanced by its contrary, problem 2bis) : nobody, even the Connoisseurs of the Setting, will know what to expect in the game (and that was the goal, initially : to put everybody on the same line). At this point, it's better to create an original setting - inspired by the source fiction but a different world, not a parallel one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_348442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348442/#Comment_348442" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-09T08:05:54+00:00" title="November  9, 2011  8:05AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ennui</cite>the American indy gaming scene where everybody strives for originality</blockquote>\nThis is because of the weird definition of "indie" we use, in which Burning Empires and Mouse Guard don't qualify due to being licensed properties not wholly controlled by the creator.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348458/#Comment_348458" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-09T09:30:24+00:00" title="November  9, 2011  9:30AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nicholas Moore</cite>However I feel unsatisfied with saying that an established setting is impossible to game in.</blockquote>\nI don't think it's impossible to game in, just very hard to game in while at the same time having a story that's similar to the source material. I think it's kind of like an uncanny valley effect -- you can get close, but not too close. When one story is "big" relative to a setting, I think it's hard to do another big story there. Doing different types of stories is a way to provide that distance if you want to work in the same setting (like a murder mystery in Minas Tirith, or a gritty war story about the the Wizarding World's fight against Gridelwald in the 1940's). Settings that don't already have iconic "big" stories also leave plenty of room for new stories -- real-world New York City is a setting that lots and lots of stories use without stepping on each other, for example. This is how most popular gaming settings work, I think (the impact of the Forgotten Realms novels on what's fun to do in that setting might be an interesting case study, but I haven't read any of them or played in that setting so I can't speak to it). I think stories that have smaller scope and stakes than the typical epic fantasy plot mean that the particular details of character, etc., have a bigger proportional impact on what makes the story unique, so it's easier to be different enough by just using different characters, etc., to avoid the uncanny valley effect.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>This is because of the weird definition of "indie" we use, in which Burning Empires and Mouse Guard don't qualify due to being licensed properties not wholly controlled by the creator.</blockquote>\nActually, we use multiple definitions of indie. Sometimes it's all about publishing. Sometimes it's about a certain approach to game design. Most people are able to figure it out from context. Sometimes we also use the word stoic about people who don't actually proclaim philosophy from a stoa.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
