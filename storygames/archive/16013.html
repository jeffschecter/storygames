Only encounters the characters were really expected to win so far were the fights against the giant bats -- but had I rolled more bats, even those could have been terrible... and even now one henchman has been lost to those flying vermin. Now that some are on 2nd level it's going to be less risky, but far from a cakewalk.<br/><br/>- Reaction rolls mean talking is an option.<br/><br/>- Movement takes time, and is slow.<br/><br/>- Searching for traps / secret doors takes even more time.<br/><br/>- The slower you move, the more random encounters you risk.<br/><br/>(I've temporarily reduced the number of random encounters for both wilderness and the section of the dungeon they're in, because otherwise it would be a pure meatgrinder: Caverns of Thracia in it's 3.5 incarnation is "A challenging adventure for four to six characters of 3rd to 8th level and higher", and while the 1979 version says it's "designed to accommodate adventurers of the 1st and higher levels" there are almost no 1HD creatures there, and I have 2-5 players per session...)<br/><br/>The only ACKS specific bits that have been active so far are the Mortal Wounds rules, which reduces mortality from vanilla 0e a tiny bit: going to 0hp might not kill you -- but I'm not sure they've had that great an impact on the game, really.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365027/#Comment_365027" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-04T09:06:29+00:00" title="March  4, 2012  9:06AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mortal Wounds rules were much too forgiving for my taste (especially with a 2nd level cleric) since they shift the feeling of danger from "dangerous monsters" to "slow clerics".

The book says the DM chooses the first spell and the rest is randomized. I didn't really like this since not getting them sleep is basically a big fuck you but I also don't want all magic users to have it. I use the method of players choosing their first spell but they have 50% chance of getting it. If they fail they choose another one (also with 50%) till they get one. The rest is randomized. Also I've written 6-7 variants of both sleep, magic missile and shield and those are randomized too to give different mages more than superficial flavor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tavis" title="Tavis"><img alt="Tavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tavis">Tavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365108/#Comment_365108" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-04T15:13:53+00:00" title="March  4, 2012  3:13PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 4, 2012 5:25PM by Tavis.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Death and Dying chart primarily reflects the desire to maintain a consistent level of consequence from death across levels, with physical effects of being dropped below 0 hp smoothing out the low-level grinder, and effects of <i>restore life and limb</i> taking care of the point when resurrection is plentiful and zipfree. It was one of the things we hashed out together during our first in-person design summit and playtest extravaganza, but "slow clerics" is a spot-on description of what I found exciting about playing a cleric across 23 levels in a D&amp;D; 3.5 campaign with Greg - can I deliver this healing in time before my ally bleeds out? The "Schroedinger's corpse" effect is there to keep this question relevant; lots of time, being in the negative hit points in 3.5 did not deliver the emergency room drama I craved when an ally went down because we were like "you're only at -1, this fight won't last eight rounds so there's no urgency". That interaction with the other design goal - making the consequences something that would distinguish your character permanently - is part of what makes it feel a little dissociative; the understanding of the wound that drops you is not automatically respected by the dice on the chart.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince this was one of our bits of really new design (or at least 'passably novel mashup'), it's not surprising that many people are hacking it; in many other respects, our job as designers was stripping away others' new design and just trying to express the original core more directly. This is awesome - every campaign is its own law! However, the probabilities on the chart as is were based to replicate the standard outcome of the "will withstand adversity" rules I'd been using for OD&amp;D; for years, and underwent at least one major tweak based on playtesting in Alex's home campaign which plays weekly or more whereas my White Sandbox is monthly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am playing ACKS which shouldn't be surprising but having been a mainstream freelancer and having friends who still are, I will maintain a professional code of omerta.<br/>\n<br/>\nA fun result with the mortal wounds table: in last night's Dwimmermount, we had established (based on a reference to a section of James M.'s text I don't have yet) that orcs were spawned by being extruded from a grate in the ceiling as bloody chunks, which then fell to the floor and re-assembled to become immediately sentient and gradually less Meat Boy-looking. (When killed, they'd turn back to hamburger; hungry orcs cheerfully choose one of their number to be murdered and cannibalized, and a chief orc gets real big by having a lot of brethren to eat.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe party befriended these orcs hoping to learn information from them, but their life story proved unenlightening ("we fell down, hugged each other until we got firm, and then bashed down this door and met you"). The newborn orcs spoke perfect Thulian, and kowtowed to some ghostly Thulians they saw ("we did not know that we were unfulfilled until now"). But when they attacked another band of orcs, these friendly ones turned on them and brought down Inky Mike the dungeon-grafitti artist with a pair of critical hits. As they were eating him, a player who knew his ACKS rushed in and grabbed Mike's <i>potion of regeneration</i> during the same round in which he was dropped. I decided that this potion used the same Thulian technique that was involved in orc-spawning, so when the mortal wounds chart said his knee was damaged I said that when his hamburgery bits knit back together that leg was on backward. Talk about a memorable outcome of a brush with death!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother example of making sense of indeterminate results: the Secrets chapter says you can spend gold to get a chance to find magical equipment. When players chose to do this, before rolling I'd have them describe whether they were looking for gear carried by a legendary hero of their own race or some other, from a particular ancient vault, etc. Then if they rolled and failed, I'd describe the result as "you have this thing that looks like a tooth flosser made of mysterious metal but no one has been able to tell you what it does" or "you have a sword guaranteed to have belonged to that hero, but in your hands it is merely a fine blade". Since the only positive result of all those rolls was the <i>potion of regeneration</i>, this changed the feeling from one of failure to pride in having cool legendary stuff that remained mysterious; in future I might interpret randomly found treasure results as a clue to activating the powers of what they have already.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally a house rule for Dwimmermount, where I handle spell selection by having the player choose the first spell (this will be their "favorite spell" until they go through the procedure to change it rules-as-written) and then randomize the rest as "this is what the stars are right to cast this week." A similar procedure governs divine spells as "what your god wants you to cast", which magic-users interpret as priests making virtue out of necessity. There is a small mechanical benefit to casting the stars-are-right spell, which is increased if it is also your favorite. I said casters could try to spontaneously cast a spell that was neither their favorite nor one the stars supported, but left the procedure undefined and no one tried.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like this because:<br/>\n- when the stars say "protection from evil" is rolled for both clerics and mages it creates a sense of foreboding<br/>\n- when all mages have ventriloquism the whole party is invested in finding things to do with that spell (although in practice this rule was not necessary for us all to enthusiastically pursue Zak S.'s plan for how I should throw my voice in James' LL Dwimmermount G+)<br/>\n- when the dice flip you the bird, it's not "you suck forever." The spur to wait a week until you get a chance for all mages to know sleep means you devote some time to thinking about how to spend your gold in town, or suffering the fictional consequences of not having any gold, which is just what ACKS wants to spice the game with sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that the original text of <i>raise dead</i> also enforces this wait-two-weeks campaign pacing - part of the structure of why Gygax said keeping track of time is so important which we tried to preserve in the mortal wounds table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365177/#Comment_365177" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-05T01:11:23+00:00" title="March  5, 2012  1:11AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very cool!

(My 23rd level 3.5 guy built a stronghold but I felt gypped out of having it matter). Alex has taken two campaigns now up to those levels, dude is a gaming machine. I look forward to learning more from him @ Gary Con. At the Bklyn Strategist Saturday games I can promise you a little more like the power level at which you ran Dungeon World, third or fourth level ACKS characters are not still using their loincloths for slings. The King level guys Alex ran at the Gen Con demo were more like Power Man and Iron Fist, one PC was riding a flying disk killing dragons with a lightsaber.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag" title="viktor_haag"><img alt="viktor_haag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/591/nDZQG5TW1V86P.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">viktor_haag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365685/#Comment_365685" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-07T10:34:34+00:00" title="March  7, 2012 10:34AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 7, 2012 10:36AM by viktor_haag.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am using AKCS (or at least attempting to) to run a group of four players through the <i>Legacy of Fire</i> adventure path from Paizo. I intend to stick to the path as printed only very loosely, and I may diverge completely at spots (into dungeons, or what not). But I wanted a framework to start with, so I started with that. We've only had a single session so far, with no real dice rolling, so nothing much to say yet on the rules themselves.<br><br>In theory, I like the bits in AKCS that aren't in LL (proficiencies, the mortal wound table idea, the more concrete domain rules) which is why I chose it rather than LL to proceed with. I also liked the slightly expanded list of classes out of the box in AKCS (and the player companion beta) over LL.<br><br>In theory, again, my AKCS related posts might get posted to <a href="http://old-huron-redoubt.blogspot.com/search/label/acks" rel="nofollow">this general blog here</a>. All that's there so far is the initial "player handout" kickoff post, but if the thing gets more firmly moving there might be more appearing there.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
