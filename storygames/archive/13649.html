Here are my thoughts. This is cross-posted - <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Story-Games-Seattle/messages/boards/thread/10294169#39319989" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.meetup.com/Story-Games-Seattle/messages/boards/thread/10294169#39319989</a><br/><br/>Man, there's a lot to love about Annalise.<br/><br/>The active-player / story-guide thing is a pretty traditional player / GM breakdown - the player gets to feel immersed on their turn and the story-guide gets to do some old-schoolish GMing, which feels comfortable. Maybe that's trad gamer brain damage talking, but I like it.<br/><br/>Claims: this is awesome. As audience, I'm totally involved, listening to narration details and seizing upon them. And it did encourage recurring motifs - for example, we had - unnatural cold, vodka, shadows. And when I was narrating I was consciously adding details for others to claim if they so desired. <br/><br/>When to go to the dice is very clear, and once we'd done a few conflicts we started getting pretty quick at it. It feels like recent games have been moving away from otherkindish/shockish orthogonal good stuff + bad stuff but I still really like it - when the bad stuff doesn't happen, I don't feel like it was a waste of time to define - I feel like that risk or danger was part of the fiction. "Whew."<br/><br/>Secrets - although they didn't come up in play much for us I thought they were really cool, as a way of taking our characters in a direction we didn't anticipate, kind of like "Play it as it lies" character rolling in D&amp;D or Gamma World. I was gay, and so I was overly protective of one of my male friends; Cy killed a man, so he narrated himself having a gun. <br/><br/>Some questionable stuff:<br/><br/>We didn't know what to do about PvP. When it came up we all agreed that our characters could be treated as the story guide's NPCs when we were involved in Moments - a couple of us had Consequences that were *We get in a fight / get angry with the active player.* Even though it meant we lost control of our characters for a bit.<br/><br/>Just start playing, after only defining a vulnerability. I'm reminded of what JM said in Fiasco, about how you should bring your situation into focus before you start play, otherwise it'll be directionless &amp; dull. But this seemed to work pretty well - our introductions were pretty short and to the point, and our play felt like the first act of a movie, where we're still learning who the characters are and what's going on. And it was still fun - the conflict system is just fun all by itself.<br/><br/>There's very little pushing us to move the story forward, except advice.<br/><br/>And its fatal flaw, for me:<br/><br/>It's not a one-shot. After three &amp; a half hours of play we felt like we were about halfway done. I realize this is As Designed but I pretty much only play pickup games. <br/><br/>We went present day, Detroit - we were all workers at the GM plant and union members.<br/><br/>Our scenes:<br/>1) Vinnie gets busted by the cops.<br/>2) Uncle Bruno doesn't want to help Vinnie but is forced to by his wife, so he bails Vinnie out.<br/>3) Vitaly takes Vinnie's shift at work. (earlier)<br/>4) Vinnie's house is a mess - they go to Uncle Bruno's to get a tarp and Greta invites Vinnie to spend the night and Uncle Bruno gets pissed.<br/>5) Uncle Bruno follows co-workers into the "crack house" which is actually the lair of the vampire, realizes something spooky is going on, and escapes with Sanchez but leaves Danny.<br/>6) Vitaly followed the same co-workers, but snuck in the back, and has a conversation with the vampire - turns out the vampire is from Siberia also, which hits Vitaly's vulnerability (he only gets along with russians)<br/>We prematurely thought it would be a good idea to switch to Act 3 here:<br/>7) Uncle Bruno is freaking out about the crack house so Vinnie goes to check it out and meets the vampire and finds Danny, dead and drained, and the vampire's ancient Siberian treasure. The vampire asks Vinnie to do something stupid which hits Vinnie's vulnerability (crippling lack of foresight.)<br/><br/>Maybe it could be hacked for a one-shot...something like:<br/>* Setting is always present day and vampire is always "classic vampire" so you don't have to spend a lot of time discussing setting &amp; genre details. (I think part of the reason Fiasco plays fast is because it's usually present day and you don't spend time working out "and there's these islands floating in space and a tribe of minotaurs lives in the forest"...) You pick a city and you're good to go.<br/>* Start the players with 7 coins to split between secret &amp; vulnerability instead of 13.<br/>* Only allow one Moment per scene.<br/>* Only have 2 PC's - with 3 or 4 players, the third and fourth player are always storyguides. (Like we do with Polaris. This effectively turns it into a GM'd game...)<br/>* Have a stricter act structure:<br/>= Introductions<br/>= First round of Foundations: you must hint at the Vampire.<br/>= Second round of Foundations: you must establish a relationship with the Vampire.<br/>By the end of this you'll have 2 and only 2 satellite traits, one on vulnerability and one on secret...which doesn't make a lot of sense with the game economy - you'd be incented to spend all your core trait on your one satellite trait. Maybe the satellite trait is just a detail that further defines your core trait, but you don't actually get to invest any coins in it, much like in Smallville how you add a sentence of description to your relationships and values. You still need to be able to flip those traits though, I'm not sure how that would work mechanically.<br/>= Two rounds of Confrontation. If you haven't given in by the end of two rounds, you "win".<br/>= Epilogues.<br/>* The story guide is instructed to play antagonism hard - try to exhaust the active player's resources. (And now there's no conflict-of-interest because the story guide doesn't have his own PC he wants to protect.)<br/><br/>With 2 PC's, that would be 2 intros, 8 scenes, and 2 epilogues - and the scenes would be shorter because of the 1 moment rule. <br/><br/>What do you think?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312398/#Comment_312398" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-13T20:06:36+00:00" title="February 13, 2011  8:06PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, the text of Annalise is interesting. Or the way it worked with my brain is interesting. I read it and could not make heads nor tails of how the hell the game played. Then I hit the end-of-chapter summaries and I was like, "Oooh." I need nice, simple little procedural lists. Otherwise I get lost in a sea of text. But that sea of text had everything we needed in it when we went to refer back to the rules. No question went unanswered and it was easy to find.<br/><br/>There were only two of us, which made playing Annalise easy. I only had to snag one other person and go. Me and Carly have a regular one-on-one Burning Wheel game going, she wanted to play and we'd only just played BW the previous night, so I pushed this on her. We'll be playing it again, probably as our break-from-BW game, to wrap it up in the next couple of weeks.<br/><br/>Carly played the active player first. She played Sabine, a woman who primarily worked from home as a graphic designer. We had a scene with coming home to her apartment, working in front of the computer for awhile, and then going to bed. As she got into bad she rolled up her pantleg and took off her prosthetic leg.<br/><br/>I played Joshua, an old, balding, overweight man with a tattoo on his bicep you could no longer make out. He peered out of his peephole at Sabine as she walked by, and then stepped out and left a note taped to her door reminding her to pay that month's rent. He returned to his apartment which was filthy. Empty pizza boxes, stacked up newspapers, that sort of thing. On an shelf next to his door was a framed photograph of him with a woman about his age and two younger men, his sons. I worked in that his wife had died and he was estranged from his two sons but used to have a plumbing business with them.<br/><br/>We went into the Laying the Foundations phase. Sabine woke up and her prosthetic leg was missing. She worked her way around her apartment, but couldn't find it. Later, she was working again and one of the executives of the company she worked for called and chewed her out because she hadn't received some work she was waiting on. Sabine avoided losing her job, and then after she hung up an executive of another company called her and wanted to offer her a position for their company after they were impressed with some work she'd done through her agency. They agreed to have an interview.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Joshua woke up one morning and realized someone had tampered with the photograph by the door. They had scratched a line across the throats of everyone in the picture. His door was still locked though. He bullied one of his tenants, an old man named Mr. Willard, into revealing that a young man had been lurking around Joshua's door. He was mostly nondescript except he had a prosthetic hook for a hand. Joshua called the cops who showed up and took his statement. One of his sons was classmates with one of the cops so they got on well, but the other cop was concerned with the state of his apartment and told Joshua he'd have to file a report to have a social worker come check on him. Joshua begrudgingly accepted it, and talked about the boy stalking him. It turns out they had a young man with that description at the jail, and agreed to let Joshua come talk to him. At the station, Joshua asked him why he was doing what he was doing and the young man told him he'd been paid to by a stranger. Joshua said some insulting things to him, the young man lunged at him and grabbed him through the bars, but Joshua - an old marine - punched him in the face and dropped him to the ground.<br/><br/>That's where we ended! If the young man was just some hired punk, how did he get into Joshua's apartment when it was locked? What's going on with Sabine's missing leg? We still have more foundations to lay before we move onto the confrontation, but it's been really neat and atmospheric so far.<br/><br/>I love the Claims system. It's a really clever way of reincorporating things and creating a consistent atmosphere as a result. <br/><br/>It might end up being a game for smarter people than me. Joshua got more scenes because we ran out of time, but I feel like Carly did a better job framing conflicts and creating interesting situations than I did. But we'll see.<br/><br/>Oh, and I love Secrets. I think both Secrets and Claims are things that are a lot cooler when there's more than two people playing, but they are still pretty cool. Secrets only came up in Carly's scene once when she hinted that she'd been in an accident, but I have no idea what was involved in it.<br/><br/>It's a really powerrful game I think. The mechanics are robust, but the game doesn't provide you with a ton of direction on when to engage mechanics. It's your discretion. One thing that's interesting to me is that the transition from Laying the Foundations to The Confrontation is entirely up to the players. The vampire (or maybe it's not a vampire and is something else instead) emerges gradually in play. I think that's ballsy and scary. But I think there's no other way to have the game set up and maintain a sense of mystery and fear. With the system and only a little fictional guidance, I think me and Carly are making a creepy vampire story. It helps, I'm sure, to be steeped in horror movies (I was wearing my Let the Right One In shirt while we played) but I think the vampire narrative is one that most of us know anyway.<br/><br/>Definitely cool. I am glad I played and looking forward to picking it up for our next session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312705/#Comment_312705" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-15T13:55:48+00:00" title="February 15, 2011  1:55PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool thread.
