A research facility, once a site of Nazi atrocities and now in the hands of a private corporation, is under lock-down.  Someone inside the facility made a desperate telephone call.  Their allegations were chilling: That the company was continuing the horrific experiments of the Facility\u2019s previous owners, that those experiments had uncovered something awful, something otherworldly and wrong, and worst of all, that the result of the twisted research had somehow broken free.<br/><br/>Any other place, any other time, the call would be dismissed as the ravings of a madman.  But this is the border of Soviet-controlled Germany, at the start of the Cold War.  And Berlin\u2019s secret police agency, the RPA, knows something that most people do not: The desperate struggle of German scientists to develop weapons capable of winning the war bore strange fruit.  The esoteric research of Nazi occultists uncovered dark secrets.  The war has left Germany crippled and divided, but more, it has unleashed on the world a nightmare of twisted technology - shambling half-dead things, horribly altered human beings, and worst of all, hellish beings from outside our world.<br/><br/>French soldiers have surrounded the Facility, allowing none to enter or leave.  The building, once a stately Chateau, is now almost a fortress.  Inside, who knows what awaits?  Four agents of the RPA are on their way, uniquely skilled to handle this situation.  But the fingers of Cold War paranoia reach even into the RPA.  Each of the agents has their own reasons for going to the facility.  Each of them has their own secret allegiances.  Can trust and loyalty overcome deceit and betrayal? Will the agents stand united, or be divided and fall?</blockquote>\nI think the stand-out technique I used in this game was the way I set up the pre-generated characters.<br/><br/>I wrote four characters, each with a different national background and a different draw into the RPA. By themselves, the characters were fairly stereotyped, straightforward archetypes. An American ex-diplomat, a Russian former soldier, a French Resistance fighter, and a German Bureaucrat.<br/><br/>I also wrote up four "secret agendas", representing a mission given to the character by the spy agency the work for, organisations like the CIA, Gehlen Org, and so on. Here's an example one:\n<blockquote><b>CIA</b><br/>The CIA is a young but enthusiastic agency created during the war for the purpose of intelligence gathering and counterintelligence.  In Europe, the CIA largely focuses on disrupting the activities of its Soviet counterparts, the GRU and the MGB.  <br/><br/><b>Your Mission:</b> There\u2019s a Soviet mole in the RPA.  Intercepted transmissions indicate that they\u2019ve been assigned to this mission, but don\u2019t give any clues to their identity.  Find the Russian agent and eliminate them.  You have a syringe of insulin which will kill someone without leaving any traces.<br/><b>Questions: </b><br/><b>Answer now: </b>How did you come to work for the CIA?<br/><b>Answer during play:</b> Are you willing to kill a colleague, and possibly a friend?</blockquote>\nAs well as the secret agendas, I wrote "personal motivations", individual motives for the characters, these were also randomly assigned. Here's an example:\n<blockquote><b>Absolution</b><br/>You did something terrible during the war, something you can\u2019t forget.  Maybe this mission is your chance to redeem yourself, or maybe it\u2019s where you finally meet your punishment.<br/><b>Answer now:</b> What terrible thing did you do?<br/><b>Answer during play:</b> What will it take for you to find absolution?</blockquote>\nSo you'll notice that in those examples there's a bit that says "answer now". After the players chose their characters, I randomly handed out the secret agendas and personal motivations. The players then had to work out how these three elements fit together into a whole person.<br/><br/>My hope was that building the character themselves, out of pre-generated pieces, the players would feel a little more ownership of the characters, and play them with a little more nuance. I've found that sometimes in convention games, players can play their characters as slavishly devoted to whatever cause or motivation they're given at the start of the game. For this game, as I think Cold City requires, I wanted the characters to have multiple conflicting goals. I think having the players work on their characters themselves helped them buy into the characters' goals, but also helped them see those goals as negotiable.<br/><br/>In play, it worked out pretty well. The players all reported feeling pretty connected to their character, and they enjoyed answering the questions before and during play. I was really happy with how that aspect of the game worked out.<br/><br/>To highlight the characters, I had a long lead-in to the game, with the various characters getting aboard the train one after the other on its way out of Berlin. The players each got a chance to describe their character, and interact with the other characters a little, establishing base relationships and sparking some early suspicions. This is a trick I learnt from running The Mountain Witch, where I like to start with the Ronin meeting in a sakeya in the village before their journey.<br/><br/>This part of the game worked out ok, but if I did it again I'd take more opportunities to separate the characters or put pressure on them. As it was, we had a good idea of the characters before play proper started, but the scene felt a bit long and slow. It was ok.<br/><br/>The meat of the game was the characters investigating the facility, interacting with its staff and trying to figure out what was going on. Some of the staff had been taken over by an aggressive outsider called "The Swarm", and were trying to spread further and escape the facility.<br/><br/>I was going for a whole metaphor for the spread of communism thing, with the infected being almost impossible to detect, and hiding amongst the regular population. That aspect of it worked pretty well, but at around the mid-point the game hit kind of a lull. The infected were undetectable, and had no apparent motivation other than spreading the swarm. The problem was that the players didn't really know what to do about the problem, and didn't really know why they should care about it overmuch.<br/><br/>We got through it, and there was a nice moral dilemma at the end, with the RPA HQ telling them to burn the place to the ground, and execute anyone who might be infected (i.e everyone), and the characters divided on whether they were willing to go that far.<br/><br/>So it worked out ok. I wish I'd been able to playtest the scenario ahead of time, so I could make the matter more pressing, add in some more horrific moments and maybe a time-limit or something to ratchet up the pressure. As it was, it was a game that all the players said they enjoyed, but I felt like I could have done it better.<br/><br/>Let me know if this sounds interesting to you, and I'll email you my notes for the game. They're pretty extensive so they should be everythng you need to play (and improve) on the game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
