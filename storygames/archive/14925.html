Why can't they have it?  (Actually this could answer most of the "what do we do now?" questions...)<br/><br/>The relationships and needs and whatnot should practically scream out what scenes to have.  If they don't, well, it's possible to have an off combination every now and again, and at least one playset suggests firewalling off some options.  And it might be worth trying one of the fast setups. \n<blockquote>"OK, are we supposed to set stakes first or define the central challenge first or just start narrating and see where it goes?"</blockquote>\nNarrate and see where it goes.  It's hard to go too wrong.  And see above.  \n<blockquote>"Are we describing this third-person or acting it out?"</blockquote>\nWhichever you want to do.  Whichever way you'd do whatever other RPGs you play. \n<blockquote>"So wait, he's going to resolve and he wants to collect white dice; so I want to direct the scene so that there'll be cost involved...uh...is there a way to do that?"</blockquote>\nPush him hard.  And see above.  \n<blockquote>"What exactly is the role of these damned valuable mice in the story?!!?"   ;-)</blockquote>\nNow I'm envisioning a playset that involves white mice and black mice, and the color of the die used to resolve the scene signifies the appearance of one of the mice.<br/><br/>This is pretty much the heart of Fiasco:  What does that character want, and why can't they have it?

Fiasco is worthy of praise but those praising it are people who do not need what it does not do. <br/><br/>Was that confusing? There is sometimes a blindness in this community as to what skills are necessary to make this stuff work.<br/><br/>I found playing it quite stressful in the ways Christopher spoke of. As for ways to make it work for your group I don't know, experience? drama class? watch more directors commentaries, TV tropes?. <br/><br/>What fiasco does not do is cue specific and significant character action, it literally builds most everything else of the story, how it starts and ends and a bit of the middle. But it does not cue method or action. Games like burning wheel have skills and checks, AW has moves, these cue players into taking specific actions or employing methods. Fiasco not so much.<br/><br/>If anything I would add a simple method descriptor to play sets. In addition to relationships, goals, locations add means/method.<br/><br/>Do any more then that and i don't think it's fiasco anymore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hoog" title="hoog"><img alt="hoog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hoog">hoog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339611/#Comment_339611" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-19T04:34:54+00:00" title="August 19, 2011  4:34AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played once.

Jason and I talked about this at Origins 2010 (when I foolishly didn't play in the Fiasco game he was running - Doh!) Once you do it you see it is easy - but until you do you don't know you are allowed to do it. Then once you know that you can you have to figure out what you want to do - and that kind of freedom is also hard because it means you have to own yourself. You make things happen.<br/><br/>What I noticed when I played this Origins was that while I'm comfortable making shit up - I didn't know what limits the rules set on that. I found out there are no limits. <br/><br/>The limit that does exist is the non-verbal negociation between the players not in a scene on whether or not the outcome was good or bad. I tended to jump in early and present an oppinion (by showing a colored die to the other players not in the scene) I found that some players were witholding of expressing an oppinion. That was more the conflict for me than the conflict in the story.<br/><br/>Once thing I did find annoyingly interesting was how plans I layed out for my character were shot down because they were too logical - too reasonable. At my core I'm not a person with poor impulse control with high ambition and that reflected in my play (though I did try to get the girl by urging her to date my son, I did view my son as a threat to me by having a gun in our house that I had used in an old hit, and I then did sell my son out to the police cos someone had to go down and I didn't like the little shit anyway!) <br/><br/>From a design point of view I really like the use of random event tables to customize each play session. I included that in Cthulhu Madness after seeing that. <br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339624/#Comment_339624" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-19T06:09:31+00:00" title="August 19, 2011  6:09AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the record, I'm comfortable with free-form.

I'll see what I can do and also go bug my fellow players to come look here; they're better at that.<br/><br/>The first game was using the wild west set.  One player (of five) has a problem with that but didn't know it up front.  Shane and I played partners in a long-running scheme that started during the war in which we stole confederate weapons and sold them in Old Mexico.  The guns were stored in a secret old cave on the property of my family cabin.  Steve played my nephew -- a young deputy sheriff who started out idealistic but turned bad quickly.  He and the sheriff, played by Eric, were sitting on a cage full of special mice that had been left behind in the stage when a robbery ended with everyone dead.  The mice were quite strongly insured so they knew they were valuable and tried through the whole story to figure out how that was working.  The Sheriff worked on the side for the evil town patriarch, played by Paul who owned all the business, more or less, and had dirt on my character's partner, making him work the gun-trade angle for the old guy's benefit.  The primary focus of my character's story was courting the niece of the old rich guy but she ended up dead on the train tracks.  There were a bunch of other details, of course.  Steve's character and mine ended up well (I think) and the others all sucked.<br/><br/>You know, it's funny, in remembering it enough to write up, it sounds like a pretty good fiasco story.  But like I said at the top it was a really rocky ride.<br/><br/>The second story was played in suburbia; Apple Valley, to be exact -- which was selected because that's an actual suburb here in MSP.  There were three of us this time.  I was a slacker who almost lived at the local rec center that was adjacent to this cop's property.  I sold pot, usually in the trees in the cop's back yard, paying the cop for the use of his land.  But I wouldn't sell harder drugs because that shit'll mess you up.  Eric played the cop who was tied to Paul's character because he was a rookie cop who'd been a football rival of mine back in middle school.  Police work was a "declining industry" and much of their interaction was related to writing a grant to get more money for drug-law enforcement.  IIRC, they ended up importing real drug dealers to Apple Valley to prove that they were needed.  All of our characters had bitter endings.

The biggest issue I had with it was the cheese that I managed to pull.  The nephew started out as an idealistic young cop, who was shocked that his uncle was smuggling weapons.  At the Tilt (iirc) the two factors were something goes missing (the weapons) and someone isn't really innocent (the nephew).  <br/><br/>(We pretty much decided that was what the Tilt meant before starting the second act - is that the right way to do it?)<br/><br/>At the end of the first act, I had been given a single white die.  The goofy rules thing is that I was able to choose to resolve in the second act, guaranteeing that I finished with 3 white dice, which is a pretty decent chance at a good outcome.  The difficulty Chris is talking about is that it was hard to make ma want to take a black die.  The first conflict they set it up so that I succeeded in killing my friend to keep the weapons secret (which I didn't really have a problem with, cause I figured hey - not so innocent).  I forget the second conflict, but they were generally having trouble setting up a conflict in which I could possibly be motivated to take a black die. <br/><br/>System-wise, I don't think there is a solution, but possibly we were making a mistake in advocating for our characters instead of making decisions based on artistic sensibilities.  Since you can choose to resolve in the second round, by giving yourself 2 identical dice, you can weight yourself fairly significantly in favor of a good outcome.  Chris managed to get a good outcome by picking black dice when he was resolving, but that was narratively speaking much more painful, because the other players could set up some horrible situation, and by picking a black die, he'd be making it worse for himself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339641/#Comment_339641" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-19T10:11:17+00:00" title="August 19, 2011 10:11AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experience with the one time playing Fiasco: my pacing was totally off (I didn't understand how quick it would all go), and it was playing with a group I had just met, so there wasn't much of the "click" that makes improv/freeform stuff really hot. I liked it well enough, but it wasn't an amazing experience or anything.<br/><br/>My critical takeaway from playing the one game, tho: it seems like Fiasco all about "do these things you like doing, and don't worry about the other things." Basically, I felt like it was tossing all that "game" stuff out the window and saying "you know how you like to sit around with your friends and make stuff up? here's a structure for that." I could imagine having a great game of Fiasco with the folks I used to play GURPS with, where we basically just talked in character for four hours and rolled 3 dice sometimes.<br/><br/>For people like me, who really enjoy fiddling with all the little gamy levers and pushing the buttons, there isn't really anything to grab on too, which is a little unsatisfying from the mechanics wonk perspective. (Tho I do love the Aftermath stuff, thats my favorite part) But I see where the love is coming from, especially for people with groups where that "click" happens early and often.<br/><br/>Dunno if that helps any, but there's another anecdote for you!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339642/#Comment_339642" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-19T10:13:22+00:00" title="August 19, 2011 10:13AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Grover</cite>(We pretty much decided that was what the Tilt meant before starting the second act - is that the right way to do it?)</blockquote>\nWhat I say is "These elements are shared by the table and not attached to particular Relationships.

Usually, it's something about the players not gelling as a storytelling unit (if that makes sense).<br/><br/>The worst experience was with a difficult playset (a Cthulhu-on-a-submarine one) at Games on Demand last year. We didn't really know how to tell a crime caper story with those constraints and it showed. It didn't help that the players didn't really know each other and some were new to Fiasco.<br/><br/>Although Denys' comment about overthinking it, above, is harsh, I think there's some truth to it. If you import ideas from other games (e.g. stakes, driving scenes towards conflict), Fiasco can fail. It relies on you playing in a loose, freeform way, with the dice ending scenes for you.<br/><br/>I also think that Jason's made a deliberate decision to leave decisions to individual groups. For example, the answer to your question about narrating vs acting it out is: do whatever your group likes to do. He could have spelt it out in much more detail, but didn't, and I think that's a valid choice. This, of course, makes the game more annoying for people that like their rules spelt out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339654/#Comment_339654" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-19T12:07:27+00:00" title="August 19, 2011 12:07PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 19, 2011 12:12PM by jenskot.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played Fiasco 9 times with 3 games being really good. It's feels very hit or miss but when it's good, it's really good. It feels strange to say it relies on having great players\u2026 because that's true to an extent with most games\u2026 but it seems really the case here. And great players who know each other really makes a difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nOgreteeth (Tim) facilitated (and played) in my 9th game of Fiasco last night. It was really good. He also facilitated it differently than my previous games. He did a great job explaining the game and focusing it in a way that improved our chances of success (in my opinion).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Fiasco hasn't been great, it's usually with strangers at conventions. Which is strange for me since usually my favorite RPGs are at cons with strangers! Additionally, Fiasco worked great for me when someone acted in a GM like role.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other things\u2026 and this is true for most games\u2026 a lot of what went wrong in Fiasco games I've played could have been avoided if everyone read the rules. That's rarely the case. Sometimes no one has read the rules!<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: I should note... 3 really good games out of 9 isn't a bad ratio! Some games are great right away because they are like games you have already played and/or the game tightly dictates what you can and can't do... but Fiasco is both different and leaves a lot of the game up to you... so it's going to take a while.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339655/#Comment_339655" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-19T12:15:50+00:00" title="August 19, 2011 12:15PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have played Fiasco about 10 times now.

There is a some times a blindness in this community as to what skills are necessary to make this stuff work.<br/><br/>I found playing it quite stressful in the ways Christopher spoke of.</blockquote>\nThis was my experience, as well.<br/><br/>The fiction was quite interesting, and, if re-told, would make a great story or movie. Everyone was very much on-board with the "Coen Brothers movie" concept.<br/><br/>However, the actual process of playing was very awkward, and it felt like the game did not make clear what we were supposed to do. I think some groups have this stuff figured, or it just happens naturally, but I played with a group of semi-strangers, and we were all unsure how to engage with each other.<br/><br/>Imagine getting together a group of people and telling them: "Ok, now, you guys will all tell a story together, with no rehearsal or takebacks. It's about a hairdresser, a con man, and a young widower. Go!"<br/><br/>What would happen? Often, people start talking all at the same time, all over each other, or everyone sits there quietly, or some combination of both. That's what happened to us.<br/><br/>What we lacked entirely was any kind of tools to resolve conflicts between the players: for example, let's say Jane wants the action to focus on the hairdresser's seduction of the con man, but Jim keeps pushing the story towards the con man's engagement with the mafia, and it completely disinterested in the seduction plot. Who gets their way? <br/><br/>The most common problem was, actually:<br/><br/>Player One: "OK, I want you all to Establish a scene for me."<br/>The other players look at each other, and no one's sure who should talk and how much they're allowed to say. Sometimes you'd sit quietly and find everyone else was waiting for you to speak, other times you'd jump in with your ideas and you'd find that you'd tread all over someone's elses, and so frustrated another player.<br/><br/>We were trying to establish some concept of how the social interaction was supposed to go at the table, and it felt like we were hashing it out from scratch, which can be pretty painful.<br/><br/>I'd say Fiasco demands some pretty serious group freeforming skills.<br/><br/>The Setup, Tilt, and Aftermath were like a breath of fresh air in comparison, and tons of fun. Given those constraints, the players all felt free to make stuff up to their hearts' content, and a great time was had. Within the scenes, however, it would sometimes flow and sometimes... it was like pulling teeth or knocking heads.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339661/#Comment_339661" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-19T12:49:05+00:00" title="August 19, 2011 12:49PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>censoring myself<i>just enough but not too much</i>can be a strain.<br/></blockquote>\nI can relate to this one, 100%!<br/><br/>Note also, however, that I've never read the Companion.

There were three of us this time.  I was a slacker who almost lived at the local rec center that was adjacent to this cop's property.  I sold pot, usually in the trees in the cop's back yard, paying the cop for the use of his land.  But I wouldn't sell harder drugs because that shit'll mess you up.  Eric played the cop who was tied to Paul's character because he was a rookie cop who'd been a football rival of mine back in middle school.  Police work was a "declining industry" and much of their interaction was related to writing a grant to get more money for drug-law enforcement.  IIRC, they ended up importing real drug dealers to Apple Valley to prove that they were needed.  All of our characters had bitter endings.  And this game ran more smoothly, but that's reasonable for a second playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully that's enough to show you the outline of what we were doing.<br/>\n</span><br/>\nHi all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm the Paul who is part of Chris' group.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the record, yeah, the second game went smoother than the first by a long shot. I would even go so far to say that the Aftermath went the smoothest of all.  it really felt, when we were spooling out the horrible fates of our characters, that we really were<br/>\nmaking the game sing.

But I got outvoted, and we played ice station anyway...<br>\n<br>\nIt went ok. Two things I noticed:<br>\n- We felt a compelling urge to generate some kind of ice-station related plot rather than the kind of personal sheeyat that I perceive Fiasco to be about. (E.g. something Man Was Not Meant To Know trapped in the ice.) We didn't actually follow through on the urge, but it was distracting.<br/>\n- There was less stuff to play off. Actually I think if we had thought about it there was probably loads of stuff, but again the ice station scenario somehow made us feel like there was only snow.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, it seemed to work regardless. The story centred on Archie White, a trucker who does supply runs for the MadMurdo base. He had somehow got tricked into smuggling illicit goods for Gilbert Stringer, an embittered navy comms officer who dreamed of making Admiral but got stuck in the back of beyond instead. Stringer blackmailled him into continuing to do his dirty work for him. The cool thing was, White only knew Stringer as "the voice", a mysterious presence at the end of this CB radio. White had gotten locked into the ice station life when he married his (now ex) wife Elena, and after the divorce he never left, but became dependent on "the voice" as his only source of human contact. The whole thing unravelled when Elena asked Gilbert to smuggle some experimental biomatter out of the base for her, and by chance discoverd that Archie was the one doing the smuggling. Hilarity ensued, ending in both Archie and Gilbert getting shot while Elena escaped on a light airplane. Archie recovered, but Gilbert was paralysed from the neck down and left stuck in hospital, hiw only contact with the voice of Archie via CB radio.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know if that's what Fiasco is "meant" to look like but we really enjoyed our first outing!                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339742/#Comment_339742" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-20T09:32:51+00:00" title="August 20, 2011  9:32AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 20, 2011 9:33AM by noclue.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jim pinto</cite>I have played Fiasco about 10 times now.

They time limit it and get people outside of the scene negotiating over what the outcome will be. I agree though that the end game dice rolling wasn't where the fun of the game was in for me.

Yeah. We actually don't mind games that take a turn around the story to get going. And while some people may like to frame every single detail when they direct, I just like to say, "Okay. Bob and Jane are in this scene. Sitting in the car in front of the house. Engine running, blasting Whitesnake on the tape-deck. Go." One of the tricks I've learned about game design (especially RPGs), is that you don't have to remind people to be self-absorbed assholes. They will do that all by themselves. Scorcese gets amazing performances out of people because he sets up the camera exactly how he wants it, frames the scene exactly how he wants it, and lets the quality actors do their job. He might nudge them here and there before he can do more than ONE TAKE, but I'm not sure how much of that needling is necessary. Fiasco is the ideal game for me as a player because I just let it go and see what happens. I never feel like, "damn. we never got back to the plot about the industrial drums." It doesn't matter, the ending about the school children all snitching on one another was a better way to go.<br/><br/>Chris. I feel the game COULD exist without the dice. But players used to a little bit of CRUNCH in their games wouldn't like it as much. And that's fine. For me, I don't need them to tick down the end of the game, but If I want to play three acts of Fiasco, damn it, I'm gonna do it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rabalias" title="rabalias"><img alt="rabalias" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://en.gravatar.com/userimage/13975177/05fabf2f530a5a081b62b0cf469c7a48.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rabalias">rabalias</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339823/#Comment_339823" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-21T00:50:39+00:00" title="August 21, 2011 12:50AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Re the dice - even on our first outing we found we had to ignore at least one roll (our set up was almost entirely 1s and 2s and we felt that didn't offer nough discretion on what elements to include). But they do provide a structure to hang the game off, so you have somewhere to start.

Some of the questions you raise revolve around the common points of contact where these decisions are usually made organically. Third person or acting it out? Up to you. What's up with the mice? Up to you. The only wrong answer to this sort of question is an answer that isn't right for your group.<br/><br/>Other common decisions left to the table - what constitutes "positive" and "negative" outcomes? How does the initial series of Setup inputs gel into a coherent situation? How much does the group pre-plan and telegraph as opposed to discover in play? All up to you. I've seen these questions answered in different ways based on local play culture. I believe that not being explicitly told how this stuff is <i>supposed </i>to be makes Fiasco more flexible and approachable. Occasionally, when people look for specific answers that are not there, it also makes it more difficult.<br/><br/>So that's my answer about procedural ambiguity - feature, not bug! I totally understand that this is not everyone's cup of tea.<br/><br/>Some of your questions are answered in the rules - you do not set stakes, for example (See page 32). Two things I've observed that may or may not apply to your experience, Christopher - first, learning as you go is a recipe for a rocky session, rather than having someone who has thoroughly read the rules and can facilitate. Second, I've seen groups plug in "what we always do" well beyond the decisions prompted by Fiasco's deliberate ambiguity. This leads to all kinds of weirdness, like nine-player sessions and sessions with a GM. <br/><br/>The circumstance you mention, where somebody wants to succeed and is Resolving in Act Two, is always challenging if you'd prefer that they fail. We talk about this in the Companion and give an example of one way to handle it. You and your partners in crime need to craft a situation they desperately want to fail, which isn't easy. I usually ask myself "how can I make getting what they really want also be unacceptably awful?" and go from there. If a Resolving player is truly fixated on success, this isn't a fight you can win. When I see this I just encourage a situation where they can have a spectacularly positive outcome, which is what they want at that point.<br/><br/>In any case, take heart! I think it's been pointed out that a somewhat rocky first session isn't unusual. The nice thing is that once you've hammered out how your group is answering the ambiguous questions and internalized the procedures, further sessions typically become both easier and more fun.<br/><br/>I hope this helps! Thanks for starting this thread, which is really informative and useful to me. I'm happy to talk about your specific issues or those of other posters, but I wanted to directly address yours first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339949/#Comment_339949" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-22T07:48:40+00:00" title="August 22, 2011  7:48AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2012 10:11AM by ChristopherWeeks.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Jason.

I really like that mini-game.  I found myself ignoring the big stack of fours knowing that I'd have time to get to those.  But this two, it's the only one available -- what can I do with that?  It's funny how I see scarcity and jump on it -- getting the two and using it well was sufficiently important that I wouldn't even look at what I might do with a four.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
