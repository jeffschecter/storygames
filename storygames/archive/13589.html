If you don't know, Diaspora is FATE-based and a bit like Traveller. It has a five-stage character creation system, in which you narrate each phase of your character's life, until you arrive at the present day.<br/><br/>So, at the start, we joked around about Traveller. Simon said he wanted his character to level up. I said something about dying during character creation.<br/><br/>Now, often, I like to take a joke and see if it works in practice. After all, jokes are as good a source of inspiration as any. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't (c.f. the time I narrated a Deck of Many Things into Polaris).<br/><br/>So, during character creation, I decided my character was Level Two. This meant a Level Two crew member (Level Ones are unskilled, you see, whereas Level Twos have skills).<br/><br/>Also, I narrated my character dying. In the third phase of character creation, during which there's meant to be a conflict, my character died in a spaceship crash. Her corpse was taken somewhere and incinerated. I didn't really know where this was going. Perhaps, I thought, I could be rebuilt as an android or become some form of technological ghost.<br/><br/>However, Simon suggested I could be the ship's computer. So that's what happened. My character, formerly a dead smuggler, was reconstructed as an artificial intelligence and now controls our ship.<br/><br/>(She still smuggles stuff.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307034/#Comment_307034" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-05T19:39:51+00:00" title="January  5, 2011  7:39PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's great, Graham. I've played around with the dead-becomes-AI-as-character thing before, and when we ran our Firefly-esque game, we were very tempted to have someone play the ship.  I think you'll have fun with that.  It's been an idea of mine for a while to start a Fiasco game with my first scene being my character's funeral and everything after being flashbacks.  For whatever reason I've never gotten around to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307038/#Comment_307038" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-05T20:14:26+00:00" title="January  5, 2011  8:14PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Doing something off the wall in your third phase is great fun -- I often do it just to up the ante for someone else -- because that someone has to narrate their take on my zany antic, and I bet on them resolving it for me.
