                    Is there somewhere that I can read about this kind of system for resolving conflicts? Using Google to search for <code>yes, and; yes; yes, but; no, but; no; no, and</code> isn't so fruitful. Thanks.                </div>

                            My group and I work with "yes and..." solely. <br/>Each individual player defines what happens to their character, and then the other players build on and riff on that to expand it, then the player of the character does the same, etc, until it eventually is built upon and expanded to the point of being something we're all artistically happy with.<br/>There's no "yes but..." because we don't believe in imposing unwanted events on each other, and there's by no means no "no" of any kind. If there was something that would be a "no", it would have been caught and reworked long before the piece of content hit the table - long before any piece of it became canon.                        </div>

                            If it's at the table, it holds, but not in our out-of-session planning stuff. <br/>Out-of-session planning stuff is serious, litcrit type stuff as far as really analyzing our collective work and what we need to do to make it sing the way we want it to.<br/>A lot of the in-session stuff works so well for us the way it does because we're working with pre-planned material, we all have equal power to influence the fiction at all times, and we trust each other to add meaningful and useful material that really helps us accomplish our artistic goals with our characters.                        </div>

                            Just for fun, here is the variation that I used in Rewind (you can get it for free on DTRPG.)<br/>-----------------<br/>Any time the outcome of an action is in doubt, you can roll two regular six sided dice, add the results of the dice together plus any advantages/disadvantages, and check the Time Table (because “What-Happens-This-Time?” table is a bit of a mouthful.)<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Time Table</span><br/>3 or less  No, and (something terrible/annoying)<br/>4-5  No<br/>6  No, but<br/>7  Delayed<br/>8  Yes, but<br/>9-10  Yes<br/>11 or more  Yes, and (something great/special)<br/><br/>Disadvantages subtract from the total of the dice while advantages add to the total. These modifiers can stack as well as cancel each other out. A maximum of -3 or +3 can be applied to any single throw of the dice. For example, being unskilled is a -1. Having mastery is a +1. (And by default, being skilled is no penalty.)<br/><br/>For example, conditions such as darkness or rain can inflict a disadvantage when searching or navigating. But, that same darkness or bad weather might offer an advantage when the protagonist is trying to hide. You can also have an advantage such as preparedness or surprise on an opponent. A character’s history might give them an advantage, if their knowledge would be really helpful.<br/><br/>Let’s walk through the seven possible results on the time table. For our example, Robert is throwing a dagger at a fleeing bandit after a failed ambush.<br/><br/>No, and You failed to hit your target and your favorite dagger goes ‘ploomp’ in the swamp, never to be seen again.<br/><br/>No, A simple failure, the dagger does not connect with the target. The story doesn’t stop nor will the bandit. Try something else.<br/><br/>No, but You failed to kill the bandit, but maybe your hit knocked him off balance and he fell.<br/><br/>Delayed Trees and brush get in the way of a clean shot. This isn’t failure unless timing is an issue. For example, the bandit is getting on a horse. Crossing swords and trading insults or witty banter could also be a delay.<br/><br/>Yes, but You succeed, but at a cost. Perhaps the bandit yelled out before he died.<br/><br/>Yes A solid success, you achieved your stated goals without a problem.<br/><br/>Yes, and Not only does the bandit fall, he accidentally reveals the name of the bandit boss, “Red Hand Sam will avenge me! Arrgh…”<br/><br/>The Time Table is designed to be casual in its details. The results are there to guide the story forward. Time travel does offer the benefit of 20/20 hindsight (or is that foresight?) When you revisit a decision point, if you do not change your actions, you can follow the same path. However, you can use your fore-knowledge to create advantages such as having the right tool, information, or perhaps just being warned in advance of an ambush.                        </div>

                            Is really the general category of which success / failure and success margin are a subset. Breaking those into pieces and re composing them decoupled outcome from from PC ability and realistic probabilities. This allowed for many players the slide toward "story" stance (Cf As the worm turns). That's my undocumentd historical hypothesis anyway.<br/> </div>

                            Right, and in d20 based systems that has caused some probability wonkiness (the chance of fumble or crit is not related to character skill, just fate). For general checks I just use binary outcomes, if I have a "no and" or a "yes but" in mind I'll do a DC12/DC20 combo                        </div>

Just saying that I'm seeing a lot of wonky probability stuff; not in this thread but it can happen pretty easily.</p></div></blockquote>
As a matter of fact I use the previous scale with the mechanic:<br/><br/><b>Player has a clear advantage:</b> Toss 2 Coins and add 1 head.<br/><b>Player has a clear disadvantage:</b> Toss 2 Coins and add 1 tail.<br/><b>In all other cases:</b> Toss 3 coins.<br/><br/>Then count the number of "heads" and narrate the result: <br/><br/><b>3 heads:</b> Yes.<br/><b>2 heads:</b> Yes, but.<br/><b>1 head:</b> No, but.<br/><b>0 heads:</b> No.<br/><br/>Which I'm sure qualifies as <i>wonky probability stuff</i> but, an that's my point, if your "4 outcomes" are flexible enough it does not really matter.<br/><br/>I mean, you should roll only when all 4 outcomes make sense* (= rolling any particular outcome is not going to spoil the game) so it all boils down to your ability to distinguish between the outcome distribution of this system and the outcome distribution of your system of choice.<br/><br/>Now, the outcome distribution of this system is:
<pre><code>Advantage:   25.0%, 50.0%, 25.0%, 00.0%<br/>Regular:     12.5%, 37.5%, 37.5%, 12.5%<br/>Disavantage: 00.0%, 25.0%, 50.0%, 25.0%</code></pre>
Whereas others systems like Fate simulate a great number of combinations but then they usually boil down to 4 outcomes ("Yes and", "Yes", "Yes but" &amp; "No") and get a distribution like:
<pre><code>4dF+2 vs 0: 38.3% 43.2% 12.3% 06.2%<br/>4dF+1 vs 0: 18.5% 43.2% 19.8% 18.5%<br/>4dF   vs 0: 06.2% 32.1% 23.5% 38.3%</code></pre>
I know that these are different distributions and the law of large numbers says that, in the long run, I will be able to tell them apart just by looking at their output, but I really doubt that for any particular 3h game you will need to roll that many times.<br/><br/>Moreover, since you have to translate the 4 outcomes to whatever makes sense for the story you will adapt them and you will add whatever the narration needs at the time: A "no, but" looking for a clue might give you a weaker clue whereas the same "no, but" fighting a dragon might left you almost dead hanging from a cliff.<br/><br/>Since the 4 outcomes are so generic it does not make much sense to agonize about the probabilities of the roll because you will have to adapt them anyway (introducing a lot of noise in the process).<br/><br/>Now, a completely different topic is whether these two system <i>feel</i> different (and I completely agree that they feel very different) and whether they encourage different styles of play (and, again, I agree that they are not equally well suited to be used in different contexts) but the thing is that <b>for the kind of games where using this kind of outcome scale makes sense the exact probability distribution of the resolution mechanic is not very important.</b><br/><br/>This being said, as a mathematician I do think that many designers do a very poor job when they work out how to translate the roll output into a scale of outcomes (which, if I understood you well, was your point) but I wanted to point out that, for this particular type of "scale of outcomes" that problem is not as relevant as for other kinds of "scale of outcomes".<br/><br/>Sorry for the wall of text... :-)<br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/>* Indeed, when you roll with advantage you cannot get a "No" and when you roll with disadvantage you cannot get a "Yes" but this is not a bug, is a feature: Now you have a crystal clear definition of what does it means "to have advantage": To be in a situation where the worst outcome you can expect is a "No, but".                        </div>

                            Indeed. "Yes, but" has a very different meaning in an improv context (accepting someone's contribution, but undermining it) than it does in terms of in-fiction resolution (the character's chosen action succeeds, but leads to complications). It may look similar on the surface, but that distinction about whether it's the player or the character who is being thwarted is pretty key.<br/><br/>Also, hypothetical reader, do be sure to review this earlier thread - it covers a lot of this:
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><a href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">@Hopeless_Wanderer</a>:<br/><br/>I think you'll learn everything you ever wanted to know about this, as well as downsides, and games it's been used in, here:<br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19114/is-the-d6-yes-and-scale-enough" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19114/is-the-d6-yes-and-scale-enough</a></p></div></blockquote>
In another discussion, we have covered how writers think about this (although I can't find it right now). Some dramatic theorists/writers have suggested that, in most stories, the most common result/outcome should be "no, and", right up until the end of the story.<br/><br/>That's an example of how the fictional output (constant "no, and" is a reasonable analysis of a lot of writing/story types, from the protagonist's perspective) does not work well in a gaming context (since it would shut down one player's contributions to the game constantly).                        </div>

Yeah, but you're talking about adding something to a system to change it. I talk about changing how we design a system to support a "and/but" mechanic in, IMHO, a smoother way.<br/><br/>And don't assume that I'm talking with only collaborating storytelling in mind. However, I do talk about how the group interact (talk) to build something together. If there were a tactical system that is going to be designed, I would have a totally different opinion.                        </div>

I really like that the system tells that the GM only should narrate the negative effects, and also suggests that the GM should involve a humorous effect. I took that way of thinking into other games as well.                        </div>

                            In my own experience, there's not much point to categorizing the three "no" responses in a ladder. A "no" roll should either be one of the three, and designing a system to accommodate all three as potential options in one roll adds complexity without significant benefit.<br/><br/>Anecdotally, most GMs already categorize roll quality based on the roll itself even if the rules don't prescribe it. The "natural 1/20" rule that pervades many d20 games evidences this.                        </div>

I suppose it depends on what games you play. In my experience with the tradsphere, getting a natural 1/20 is a Big Deal, and both players and GMs lap it up. The behavior happens emerges quite naturally regardless of the game played (especially those with binary success/failure states).                        </div>

                            But I mean on like a nat 4 or a nat 3 or something. Back then I used to see a lot of narrative power invested in the unmodified roll even when it's not a 1 or 20 and that really invalidated the character. Not that I have anything special on 1s or 20s in our game except the hobbit's luck power to reroll 1s.                        </div>

                            From what I've seen, it happens on "magic" numbers like 1/20, doubles on a percentile system (or rolling 01/00), rolling 3d6 and getting 6-6-6, rolling many successes over the target number in a dice pool game, and so on and so forth.                        </div>

You had it right the first time, and I like that term. Lots of "folk practice" that comes from those magic numbers, almost like superstitions. Ah, you rolled DOUBLES, so something else happens to make it bigger, bolder, more interesting! Success and failure magnified as a matter of drama and probabilistic outcomes.<br/><br/>Certain types adore this.                        </div>

I respectfully disagree, or rather, I'd say it depends on the intentions of the system.  <i>DayTrippers</i> (for instance) uses all of the options except for a flat "NO", and I absolutely see "No But" and "No And" as being qualitatively different than "Yes But" - especially in a game such as DT when both parties have already stated their intended actions and the die roll is working out how those two things interact.  The GM narrates the negative parts while the Player narrates the positive parts.<br/><br/>Rough example: "Yes But" means you succeeded but another problem arose, "No But" means you failed but some benefit arose, and "No And" means you failed <i>plus</i> some other problem arose.                        </div>

                            This speaks to the broader point I was trying to make (and failing, evidently).  Such logic (as above) only works if the system's point of view is unipolar, i.e. the PCs are the only active parties and everything else is abstracted.  The system I described is <i>bipolar:</i> it is what you get when <i>both</i> parties are active and the level of abstraction is equal between them.                        </div>

                            Wow, in that case, Quads, I get why people come up with bull like "failing forward" and so on and why they are so afraid of a no. Normally "can I get through this locked door?" "No you can't" "OK then I'll go do something else" is fine. It's just a door that you couldn't open. Same as real life.<br/><br/>But if the story (path) only goes one way — through that door ­— then a "no" is devastating.<br/>So <i>that’s</i> why Gumshoe and Trail of Cthulhu exist (games where you pretty much always find all the clues).

I respectfully disagree, or rather, I'd say it depends on the intentions of the system.  <i>DayTrippers</i> (for instance) uses all of the options except for a flat "NO", and I absolutely see "No But" and "No And" as being qualitatively different than "Yes But" - especially in a game such as DT when both parties have already stated their intended actions and the die roll is working out how those two things interact.  The GM narrates the negative parts while the Player narrates the positive parts.<br/><br/>Rough example: "Yes But" means you succeeded but another problem arose, "No But" means you failed but some benefit arose, and "No And" means you failed <i>plus</i> some other problem arose.</div></blockquote>
"Yes, but there is a brick wall behind the door" is nothing different than a "No, you can't lock pick the door". "Yeah, but you can't really lock pick the door because that's impossible".<br/><br/>"Yes, but" is waaaaaaaaaaaay broader than just failing forward, even though the principle could be there. There is more than one interpretation of "Yes, but" than being a nice way of presenting another option. The "but" is blocking in improv, just like "No" is blocking in roleplaying games.<br/><br/>Trying to defend "No and/but" is IMHO just not realizing what "Yes, but" actually was from the beginning, and then trying to "improve" upon it by expanding on the "and/but" formula. It's not the "Yes" in "Yes, and" that is the "Yes" in roleplaying game – it's the "<i>and</i>". While, on the other hand, the "<i>but</i>" is the "no".                        </div>

                            In my model (and I think perhaps implicit in Sandra's, and probably most people's), is the notion that the scale and/or object of the two potential results is different.  The "Yes/No" part addresses a question of greater magnitude and/or direct intentional consequence to the acting PC than the issue that arises through "And/But".  <br/><br/>The <i>total</i> question is not simply a matter of whether or not we're removing a rail segment (to use my own controversial terminology), but may indeed open up a new one (No But), or be turned to the service of increasing tension (No And).<br/><br/>As you know, <a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a>, I tend to agree with you most of the time, having always felt a sort of kinship with your approach.  But on this point I completely disagree with you, both structurally and functionally.                        </div>

<p>Let’s break it down.</p><p>“Good blocking” in impro is when a scene is splashing and you want to throw a wrench in the gears – introduce conflict and play with status.</p><p>“Accept” is when you don’t block but build strictly on the other’s contribution.</p><p>In this binary model,</p><p>“Yes, and”, “Yes, but” are both forms of acceptance,<br/>and “No, but” is still a form of “good blocking”.</p><p>However, the binary model is for accepting “world facts” – even if the facts take the form of IC proposed events, like the “Let’s go to the movies today” IC proposal example from improwiki.</p><p>Story games aren’t limited to dealing with world facts, where the “accepting/blocking” dichotomy is relevant. They are also dealing with success &amp; failure of attempts.</p><p>C.f. Fiasco where the scene resolution of a character saying “OK, I enter the pizza place and say freeze you dorks! Hand over today’s earnings from the register!” is much more about “is the character successful?” than “is there really a pizza place there?”</p><p>Blocking: “A pizza place? This is a pharmacy!”<br/>Acceptance: “Oh no, someone is robbing our pizza place!”</p><p>Hopefully it’s pretty self-evident to the story gamer that yes, there is a pizza place. There <em>are</em> mechanisms in place for blocking on this level, such as X-card or “Try another way” Archipelago card, but what we’re more concerned about is whether or not the pizza robbery – acceptance of which is a given – is successful or not. The “resolution” focus of roleplaying’s roots.</p><p>That’s when the two ternary models “yes, no, maybe” × “good bonus side outcome, no bonus side outcome, bad malus sideoutcome” give rise to the familiar nine out comes, the “maybe” results are pointless &amp; stalling so are discarded, leaving the six mentioned in the title of this thread.</p><ul><li>Success + good bonus</li><li>Success, plainly</li><li>Success + bad malus</li><li>Failure + good bonus</li><li>Failure, plainly</li><li>Failure + bad malus</li></ul><p>Rickard is talking about a different level of gameplay than what all the “Yes but / No and” stuff is about.</p><p>Arguably story games are <em>more</em> evolved than impro theatre in this regard.</p><p>“Acceptance” of world facts, as opposed to blocking of them, is a given in a GM-less / GM-full game where we build on each other’s contributions, while in a GM-driven game (including, especially, “adventure games” to use Ben’s parlance) is something wholly on the GM’s side of things (where I’ve been pushing for the GM being under some sort of “rules” for this, such as gloracle or PbtA moves/principles/agenda).</p><p>Now, in a impro model, the success and failure are <em>themselves</em> handled as if they were “world facts”.</p><p>“OK, I enter the pizza place and say freeze you dorks! Hand over today’s earnings from the register!” “I’m shaking in fear as you approach the counter” “I’m nervous too – this is my first robbery” etc etc.</p><p>There are story games that are based on resolving all scenes at this level – Microscope is what I have in mind.</p><p>But there is also great fun to be had by having explicitly different mechanics for specifically <em>resolution</em> of success/failure propositions. Especially in some stances. “I try to do X, do I succeed?” is a common enough question in many story games that it has been lifted to be a “first class mechanic” as opposed to being handled by the general “world facts” mechanic. Example: Everway, where success/failure (and other events) is fortune cards, while other, non-event world facts are vision cards.</p><p>Another example: D&amp;D B/X, where success/failure on a save-or-die poisonous bee is “dice” while the existance of the bee is “prep”.</p><p>Now, what’s my own take on this familiar yes/but/and etc hexad?</p><p>First, I seldom see value in including a bunch of side world facts (the bonus / malus effects) when I turn to the oracle with a specific question of a particular attempts resolution. “Yes” and “No” are sufficient for me since I have other ways of introducing world facts and events.</p><p>Second, for a lot of attempts the question of success or failure isn’t immediately interesting. “Can we search for traps?” I’d rather say “yes, and it takes 10 minutes” than “IDK we’ll let the dice decide” because I know that the time expenditure itself will lead to interesting side world facts / events being introduced soon enough.</p> </div>

                            I think that's a really good take on this issue from <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a>.<br/><br/>The language of "yes/no/and/but" serves a different purpose in discussions of roleplaying, stories, and improv.<br/><br/>In improv, it's all about the interaction between the participants: are you accepting the other actor's contribution, or blocking it? In this sense, "yes, but" could definitely be blocking (if you undermine their intent in trying to create a scene with you). "Yes, and" shows much better that the true goal is to *build* on those contributions, to create something together.<br/><br/>In stories, it's about the character's attempts to achieve their intentions, goals, and desires. (And I've read some very convincing dramatic theorists/writers explain that good writing is basically all "no, and", over and over - at least until the end of the story, if it's a happy ending. If you look at a lot of mainstream fiction, you'll see the main characters basically not getting anything they want or try to achieve.)<br/><br/>In roleplaying, though, the two get somewhat combined and conflated. Not only do the terms sometimes apply to fictional tasks and conflicts (which is usually not the case in improv at all), but they also refer to a mix of the <i>player</i> and the <i>character</i>: sometimes it's about the character getting their way, and sometimes it's about the player's intent coming through or not (which is not the case in fiction/stories). And, more importantly, even if the creative contributions are all about the character's attempts in the fiction ("character tries to do something"), they are still <i>creative ideas coming from the PC's player</i>.<br/><br/>That makes for interesting variables. My take is that in roleplaying, "yes, but" is rightfully "king": if we use a "no, and" structure, like in pure fiction, we can get good stories, but we no longer allow the character-player to have any input into the game/story (like a railroading GM). We are shutting down the character's attempts (which is often good for story), but we are also shutting down the player's input into the game (which is bad for us, socially). <br/><br/>"Yes, but" becomes a clever middle ground, where the character's actions (and the player's ideas/input) get to contribute to the state of the game/fiction, but the "but" allows trouble and complications to continue to arise, refusing a clean resolution of the conflicts at play.<br/> </div>

                            This is a tangent, and unimportant, but I think it's interesting to realize that AW's "move" structure is not a clear "yes", "yes, but", and "no" structure, as many people assume.<br/><br/>It's much more nuanced. Depending on the move and situation, a 10+ could be a pure "yes" (act under fire), a "yes, and" (perhaps a "read a person" move where you learn far more than you wanted to know), a "yes, but" (seize by force), or even a "no" or "no, but" (you "go aggro" on someone and they choose to "suck it up").<br/><br/>A 7-9 tends to be in "yes, but" territory, but can also be a "yes", "yes, and", or even a "no" or a "no, and" (again, "go aggro", or a "pack alpha" move where the player chooses not to make an example of anyone, so they get beat up and the gang doesn't do their bidding).<br/><br/>A miss is even more twisted, because an MC move could move just about anything, from a "no, and" to a "yes, and". "Yes, but" MC moves are commonplace, in my experience. Even a "yes, and" could happen: perhaps you manipulate a rival warlord to release a prisoner, and the MC takes that as an opportunity to hand them over but also to reveal that the prisoner is actually your lost daughter you've been looking for.<br/><br/>I think part of the cleverness of the "move" system is that it codifies the improv maxim of accepting the input (you can't ask the player not to roll the dice! that's against the rules) and then adding to it (an MC response is demanded, and the game tells you what kinds of responses are good to make - MC moves, Principles, and so forth all outline how you can be a good "improv actor" in the context of the game, but simply ignoring the player's attempt to do something is against the rules).                        </div>

                            That's a really good observation about the distinction between player-level vs character-level. The stuff I'd been saying is all about player-level (which is where I primarily operate in play), whereas I've seen a lot of talk of character-level as well, and I think there's generally points where the thread has gotten tangled up in itself over those differences (especially given that there are some people in the discussion who try to keep character-level and player-level concerns relatively the same, for instance Sandra).<br/>I'm very against player-level blocking, but very much in favor of character-level blocking (since my goal in play is essentially the production of literature). Character-level blocking is for me also something that you do to your own character, and others only are involved in if you invite them into that. But then again, I'm also telling much less adversity-focused stories than most people here I think. I'm very much of the "conflict-optional" school of writing. I'm very big on the idea that anything that your character doesn't want that happens to them needs to be okayed by you on a player level, to make sure it's something you're cool with fictionally, to make sure it fits your personal literary vision of your character's story. The Czege Principle is very non-applicable to the style of gaming I do, since I'm a big believer in the idea that the only meaningful adversity is the adversity you choose and execute and resolve yourself for your character. <br/>I'm not sure if I'm making any sort of sense here, but hopefully you guys will understand what I'm saying. I'm tired after work.                        </div>

                            I think you’re being perfectly clear! Makes sense to me. Your style of play strives to maintain player control over the character’s story and ultimate fate: the other players are simply there to support that and help you bring your vision to life (and you do the same for them in return).                         </div>

You've described your play as a group takes place both at and away from the table, though, and it's not really fair to just focus on the table half. It's like me saying "we never look at our character sheets when we're away from our character sheets". That said, I believe that you don't even do a lot of blocking in the away from the table part, either.<br/><br/>Because your play isn't about uncertainty in overcoming external adversity, right?<br/><br/>The "impro theatre" model (which also, with a couple of exceptions [discussed upthread], discourages blocking) is a pretty good fit for / description of your play. And I heard that recording and your play is freaking awesome!<br/><br/>But where impro theatre (and your away-from-the-table play, right, Emma?) is about "what happens", and your at-the-table play is about "how it happens", many (not all) story games and adventure games are specifically seeking the thrill &amp; uncertainty of not knowing if an effort is successful — finding out the outcome.

Yes and the more impressive part is that you (with the help of JKM) have built a game that takes advantage of the fact that lack of surprise isn't a limitation. That's really great design work. Instead of taking a "normal" RPG and struggling with all the unnecessary 90% of mechanics that are there to ensure surprise and tension around outcome, you've designed around this surprise-lacuna as a tremendous strength and source of simplification, allowing you to focus on what truly <i>is</i> the interesting part to your group. That's awesome!<br/><br/>Now, me and my group — and many other groups — have a drastically different agenda. We want to go down in the dungeon <del>to make peace with our days in the dungeon</del> to find weird mirrors and shit!<br/><br/>I think Rickard, though, for example, might do well to check out both Chuubo's and your groups tweaks on it.

That's a good characterization of my desired play♥ Thank you Emma.<br/><br/>But I'm not also a player. I'm also a designer (of house rules). As a designer I try to be hyper-aware of the separation of these concerns. I wrote "world-facts" (most of which are player level — who at the table has the authority to introduce facts?) vs "event facts" (character level — who at the table has the authority to introduce what happens in terms of outcome to the character's actions?). Now, for the purps of excitement and merging of player&amp;character, yes, we want the character's player to not be the one that decides the outcome of their actions. The player accepts the stakes but then don't decide whether or not she gets those stakes. An impro show, or for that matter your game, doesn't have that concern since that isn't a core part of the experience for you. Which makes your game awesomer to listen to than, say, D&amp;D, a game where a lot of effort is put into surprising the player about what they themselves are doing.<br/><br/>"I look in the mirror" "OK, you're zapped" "What!!" ← exciting to player.<br/><br/>"And then I show them the mirror, and they are zapped" ← from the audience' POV, roughly equally exciting, and has a lot less overhead in terms of information separation, mechanical complexity etc. Information separation the way it works in all adventure games and some story games is a big overhead cost. You have to have a poker face, a DM screen, secret maps, secret notes, mechanics to determine who lives or dies etc etc etc.<br/><br/>Many other story games, especially GM-less / GM-full ones, take effort to erode information separation; saying that it's good if players know everything, they can still act out their characters as if they didn't know. Chuubo's is obv of this school.<br/><br/>And that's good design — if you're not taking advantage of the benefits of information separation (and for <i>my</i> play agenda, information separation is a great tool), you should do well to rip it out because you make significant gains both in terms of lessened overhead cost (no need to spend effort keeping secrets) and in terms of a deepened understanding of the situation and everyone's desires and ideas in the situation.<br/><br/>I still think Microscope is fucking scary &amp; exciting to play <i>because</i> of its "cards close to your chest" rule (a kind of information separation) so I guess I'm still an adventure gamer at heart♥<br/>Adventure! Excitement!<br/>A long way to go before I'm a jedi<img alt=":bawling:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/bawling.png" title=":bawling:"/> </div>

                            You're right that we realistically don't do much blocking away from the table either. Generally our away-from-table stuff is just discussing what we want and suggesting ways to make it work even better than the initial idea, and helping each other fill in blanks there, say that a subplot centers on a relationship with an NPC whose identity I'm vague on, the others might say, help me work out what that NPC is all about and how we're going to run that, you know?<br/>So yeah, thinking about it, I'm generally against blocking in all forms, but there's theoretically places in away-from-table where it would be acceptable, but if something needed to be blocked away-from-table, there would be questions about what the fuck happened, where we got off the same page, and how we need to fix it. <br/>Yeah, you're correct about the lack of uncertainty about external adversity. Most of our plots don't even have external adversity at all, and some of them don't even have real adversity in the first place, you know? <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> <br/><br/>From my experience with improv theatre, it's typically pretty focused on the "how it happens", tbh, or at least most of the improv theatre styles I'm familiar with do that, at least as far as the perspective that the performers are approaching it from. Improv comedy is different, of course, and is more based in totally making it up without any plan, but to my understanding the average way of doing serious improv theatre is having a story all worked out before you start and everyone on the same page about what it is, then the improv is in the dialogue and the execution of the scenes. That might just be a thing of particular styles, and maybe it's styles that aren't popular in your area, but I can't say for sure. <br/><br/>We tried to do the "normal" RPG thing for such a long time and it was so terrible! I don't know how much I've talked about this before here (if at all), but there was a big period after we got our newest group member (which was like 3 1/2 years ago at this point) where we almost quit playing RPGs and going back to freeform exclusively because of how frustrated we were with the "normal" RPG thing. She really got us thinking about how much there was like, no engagement with the mechanics in our sessions, and how the mechanics were actively getting in our way at the time, which was something that we hadn't been examining properly up until that point. Then we found Chuubo's, like literally while we were in the middle of contemplating quitting RPGs, and realized that there really was an RPG out there that did what we wanted. <br/><br/>I'm glad I described your play appropriately. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I think the audience thing is a big part of what made the concept of hidden info and stuff never click with me even outside of personal preference until you and some other people here explained it (and also of course the difficulty in understanding it that comes from that in a lot of other RPG spaces, you're treated as an oddity if hidden information isn't your thing, and people are mean to you). <br/>Roleplaying is an activity that's always just felt very audience-based to me, even if you don't have anyone watching your sessions. A big part of that is possibly the fact that in a lot of my early groups, we often had friends watching our sessions, and they would get bored and go home or start doing something else if things stopped being interesting to an audience, but also it's because of how much I associate roleplay with acting because of my theatre background, and the fact that some of my earliest roleplaying experiences were with theatre people. <br/><br/>Information separation is so much something that needs to be included for a good reason and used to its fullest, because like, there's so much shit that just shoehorns it in to its own detriment, realistically because of geek culture's obsession with "spoilers" (aka, the capitalist commodification of surprise). I think there's really a big level where story games would do well to decouple from geek culture so that geek culture's assumptions can be examined more often in design, you know?                         </div>

Yes!♥<br/><br/>People were surprised when they saw that you and I agreed so much when you showed up here on S-G; they know my preference is very extreme and that so is yours.<br/><br/>It's just that the games we slag on is the incoherent chasm in the the middle of our two wizard's towers.

                            Exactly!<br/>There's the fact that realistically we have similar thoughts on design. We're just focused on radically different parts of designspace, with extremely different conceptual goals, but with the same general goal of finding a way to play in our ideal ways without any incoherence and unnecessary stuff shoehorned in in service of trying to incorporate other play goals. The whole thing of extremely niche play that serves ours and our groups's particular interests perfectly without wasting time on other shit.                         </div>

                            Lovely discussion, and I agree in full. <br/><br/>A question for Emma: when you’re brainstorming the material that you will play through (away from actual play, so to speak), don’t you ever say things like, “no, that’s not how I see my character’s story going. Let’s try it another way/that makes her out to be far more brave than I was picturing/I have a different idea I want to focus on”?                        </div>

                            I’m not sure where the six-result mechanic we’re discussing originated, but I first encountered it in <a href="https://tinysolitarysoldiers.blogspot.com/2012/04/solo-rpg.html" rel="nofollow"><i>Tiny Simple Soldiers</i></a>, a minimal solo RPG that looks like it was first made public in 2012. <br/><br/>It seems to me that (a) the needs of a solo system are very different from this of group-based improv, especially in regards to blocking; and (b) the symmetry of <i>TSS</i>’s yes/no mechanic is designed around the fact that the same question might be asked in positive or negative form: “Does Joe escape from the wolves?” vs “Do the wolves catch Joe?”                         </div>

                            That's a nice post, and a good application of the technique.<br/><br/>However, a minor clarification: the author actually explains that he got the d6 and boolean scale technique from FU (the "Freedom Universal RPG"). I'm guessing that's not the original source, either, but it could be (we mentioned in the earlier thread on this topic I linked, above).<br/><br/>I came up with a game I ended up calling "As the Worm Turns...", which we played here on this forum, and uses a sort of twisted version of this mechanic:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19960/as-the-worm-turns-live-open-playtest-formerly-backseat-adventures/p1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19960/as-the-worm-turns-live-open-playtest-formerly-backseat-adventures/p1</a><br/><br/>As you can see from that one, "blocking" another player's contribution isn't really an option, as they guide yours, but the "Oracle" gives everyone some input into a general prompt for where the answer might take us.                        </div>

Let’s try it another way/that makes her out to be far more brave than I was picturing/I have a different idea I want to focus on”?</p></div></blockquote>
I'm not 100% sure if I understand what you're getting at, but I'll try to answer based on what I think you're asking.<br/>Stuff can definitely change within the structure in away-from-table discussions, but it's never stuff that goes against the inherent, pre-built structure. New ideas might flesh out holes in the original plan, or they might add extra context and meaning to things in our original plans, but they're not changing or replacing things. They're just adding on to where things were already going.<br/>That being said, it's highly possible I'm misunderstanding your question. If that doesn't answer it, would a more concrete example be possible?                        </div>

                            i thought Itras By was the first, but it looks like Freeform Universal RPG was published about a year earlier. <br/><br/>Still, I think that if the idea did not come straight from improv, it might have come from the concept of critical success, success, partial success, partial failure, failure, and critical failure. <br/><br/>Note: I swear someone already mentioned that in this thread, but I can't find it.                          </div>

                            Emma,<br/><br/>I thought I had seen you say previously that it was very important to make sure all contributions matched the player's desire for where a character was headed and the story they're trying to tell.<br/><br/>Unless the other players simply aren't allowed to contribute at all, without your prompting them, surely they must occasionally make contributions that aren't to your tastes? If so, how do you handle those situations?<br/><br/>I've been assuming that there's a lot of conscious editing going on in your play (or, at least, in your planning that play): "Hey, let's take out this thing and do that instead [...] it's important to me that my character doesn't meet her nemesis just yet, so let's save that scene for later..." - stuff like that.<br/><br/>Isn't that kind of editing all about "saying no", in the improv sense?<br/><br/>Or is your group so incredibly in tune with each other that every single idea and suggestion ever made pleases everyone, every time?                        </div>

                            In the context of improv theatre, saying "yes, and" means accepting whatever contribution another player introduces, and building on it, right?<br/><br/>If you are getting together to plan the next scene for your character (let'say), and I suggest that their long-gone mother shows up, because it seems like a great time for that, can I say: "No, hang on. That's really cool, but it's way too early - I have other stuff I want to build in this character's story, before that happens, and her showing up now would close the door for some interesting developments. Can we save that for later?"<br/><br/>That would be, in very clear terms, "saying no", in the improv sense.<br/><br/>Is that something that happens with your group?<br/><br/>My current hypothesis, if you will, based on what I've heard about your game, is that "blocking", however rarely it might happen once you're on the same page, is actually absolutely crucial to making play work in the way you want it to.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" rel="nofollow">EmmatheExcrucian</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>I'm very against player-level blocking, but very much in favor of character-level blocking (since my goal in play is essentially the production of literature). Character-level blocking is for me also something that you do to your own character, and others only are involved in if you invite them into that. <br/><br/>[...] <br/><br/>I'm very big on the idea that anything that your character doesn't want that happens to them needs to be okayed by you on a player level, to make sure it's something you're cool with fictionally, to make sure it fits your personal literary vision of your character's story. </p></div></blockquote>
I interpreted this description from you to mean that the ability for a player to "block" and/or edit any contributions about stuff that pertains to their character is absolutely crucial to playing. If you can't say, "No, that's not what I want here," then you can't "make sure it fits your personal literary vision of your character's story".<br/><br/>Am I close?                        </div>

                            I think you're misunderstanding how tight our outlines are. The only time that the specific timing of an event is in our outline is when we know exactly when it's needed. <br/>To use the long-lost mother example, since we actually had a plotline about that in our ongoing story cycle: We knew from the get-go that Sadie's storyline in Part 3 of the story involved meeting and being abused by her long-lost mom, who was an Excrucian Deceiver. We knew that Irene (the mom in question) was going to trick Sadie into going with her to the Blesk Academy, supposedly to free the Soul of the Summer from the glass prison she had put him in shortly before Sadie's birth, because Sadie was pure of heart and the glass prison could only be opened by one who is pure of heart, with Irene lying up Sadie about her true intentions - killing the Soul of the Summer to consume his power after Sadie freed him. We knew that Irene was going to trick Sadie by claiming she had changed and realized that imprisoning the Soul of the Summer was wrong. We knew that emotionally, Sadie's storyline in Part 3 was about trauma taking the last vestiges of Sadie's childhood and forcing her to become an adult. We knew generally that the Bleak Academy trip was happening at the end of Part 3, but when Irene was going to be introduced wasn't something we had nailed down until when I was damn sure that Sadie was narratively prepped to meet Irene. I didn't even propose Irene's introduction scene until everything was established, and even then I planned it to happen a few sessions later to give us more time to set it up. <br/><br/>Player-level blocking is notionally possible,  but player-level blocking is for us a situation where we've fucked up and something has gone drastically wrong. Player-level blocking for us would be a product of drastic miscommunication, and it having to happen would be a situation where we put the session on hold to iron out the communication issue before continuing play. And that's what I meant about being against player-level blocking. It's the polar opposite of the extreme cohesion and artistic understanding that is central to how my group functions.                         </div>

                            Also, a note I find kind of funny is that in Looking Glass Heart (our 50ish session campaign that we're 44 sessions into and will be finishing as soon as I finish my first draft of my solo WIP), the one situation of player-level blocking was actually a player blocking herself because she realized she'd been giving us the wrong instructions for several sessions for how to play a subplot involving her character becoming the leader of a color gang, and realized that she needed to fix it, which led to retconning out four or five scenes and playing out/recording a few hours of new scenes to replace them. In our documentation, that retcon is "Session 26.5". <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"/> </div>

                            It's very interesting to get a sense of how these timelines and plots look in your game. Very cool!<br/><br/>However, somehow you have to *construct* those in the first place, right? That's when I'm suggesting that the "blocking" happens - otherwise, how do you reach consensus on those story plots ?                        </div>

                            We each construct our character's arcs/plots individually, with some discussion of core themes from the get-go, and of course discussing what we're writing with each other as we work it out.

Is absolutely any answer that another player gives here generally accepted, or do you weigh the options and discard some?<br/><br/>Or are all the questions one-way - being asked of the player controlling that character? If you're playing Sora, can I suggest that, actually, it IS Sadie, because of this other idea that would make it great? And, if I do, will you always accept that?                        </div>

                            It's pretty much always "yes, and..." there, yeah.<br/>The questions are realistically a formality and a precaution. We know the answers, but the questions are more double-checking in case somehow we were wrong. I can't think of a time where that kind of question has ever been answered with anything but an excited "yes"' and then logistical discussion of how we're going to do it. <br/>Realistically, Sora's player writes the story line with Sadie in that role in her head, then asks to formalize it and make sure that she wasn't making the wrong assumption, and with a contingency in mind just in case.                         </div>

                            I find this hard to picture. How do you get from one player constructing a storyline to a group understanding ("...we know the answers") without discussion, editing, and compromise?                        </div>

                            There's definitely discussion. I didn't mean to make it sound like there wasn't. <br/><br/>So like, some important contextualizing info on my group:<br/><b>1)</b> We all live together.<br/><b>2)</b> We're all dating each other. My group is me, my wife (who I've been with for five years), and our girlfriend (who we've been with for three and a half years).<br/><b>3)</b> We all have the same taste in media, with some minor variations.<br/><b>4) </b>We all read and watch roughly the same stuff, with of course an exception when say, one of us reads something and doesn't like it, so she doesn't recommend it to the others. <br/><b>5) </b>We have big, in-depth discussions of media on a regular basis. Damn near daily, really.<br/><b>6) </b>We're all writers, and are big fans of each other's work.<br/><b>7) </b>We go through cycles of all being interested in a theme and wanting to iterate on it that we drew from something we all just watched or read. Like for instance, after we watched Revolutionary Girl Utena, we all thought out plotlines and characters centered on compulsory heterosexuality. When we read The Feelings We All Must Endure, we got really interested in the idea of stories about really messy relationships that go through phases of being extremely unhealthy, but that work out in the end generally because the characters love each other enough to work through stuff together. Basically, we all have the same influence at any given time. <br/><b>8) </b>We create characters separate from campaigns in most situations. We all have a stable of OCs, and when we start planning a campaign with a specific theme, we pull from our stable of OCs based on who fits thematically.<br/><b>9)</b> We all know huge amounts of information about each other's OCs, and someone making a new OC is always a big conversation where she talks all about everything she's planning thematically with the character, what the character's story is, etc. Like, say that I write an OC one night. While I'm doing it, I'm talking to Mors (my wife) and Emmony (my girlfriend) about what she's like. When I finish plotting out her arcs, I talk them through the entire story as I have it in my head at that point. There's, of course, blanks.<br/><b>10) </b>There's a lot of shared language built into CMWGE. If I say "I'm thinking that Sadako is going to pursue the Creature of Delirium Arc in Empty Flame Part 3", that gives everyone a lot of information on what that story is going to be like. It gives us major beats in broad strokes, it gives us general structure, it gives us some in-built themes, and a general aesthetic. That shared language helps us a lot with getting on the same page.<br/><br/>We know what the others want because we know eachother, we know what influences a character is drawing from, we know who a character is in detail and what sorts of things they're reasonably involved in, what builds towards their themes, etc. <br/>When I for instance say to Mors "Sadie needs someone to rescue her from the Bleak Academy after shit goes down with Irene. Do you want that to be Sora?", it's not just idle speculation that that would be something reasonable. I say that because I know that Sora is a princely delinquent hero bishounen type character. I know that Sora is the kind of person who does that sort of thing, and that a part of how the paradigm of Sora works is that she steps in and plays hero for people in trouble a lot. I also know that by that point, Sora and Sadie will be dating, because our stories focus romance a lot, and our characters typically end up dating pretty quickly because it's Romance Genre, it's just a romantic plotline, and we like showing the relationships of characters who gets together pretty early on or are dating before the start of the story. Also, with Mors in particular, I know that she doesn't have the patience to write slow-burn romance, so like, 30ish sessions in, at the end of Arc 3, Sadie and Sora will for sure be dating. There's no real question there. And when Mors asks me if Sadie could be the one who tries to save Sora from Katsuko, she knows the answer just as well, because she knows that Sadie is going to be Sora's girlfriend, and she knows that Sadie is the type of character who will stop at nothing to help the people she loves, even if it means fighting a god with nothing but her wits and her paltry skills of magic. She knows that it's Sadie's paradigm to help people to the best of her ability, even if it's at huge personal risk and with little hope of success. <br/>And that's what I mean about knowing the answers, about the questions being a formality.<br/><br/>Maybe some time I should just share some of our outlines? Would that be helpful?                        </div>

                            All of this is extremely helpful, definitely! But I don't want you to feel obliged to do so - if you're enjoying sharing it, then I am ready to read and ponder and marvel (and I know I'm not the only one). It's a very unique gaming situation, and really interesting to read about! You've added an angle to Story Games we haven't really encountered before, and that's a lovely thing.                        </div>

                            I might just drop some individual outlines, because the full group outlines I have are formatted wrong because of a rule we realized we were using incorrectly between when we started Looking Glass Heart and now. Our LGH outlines were less detailed because of that misapplied rule, and there were definitely parts of LGH that made us have to do a bunch of extra work because some of our prep had been insufficient.                         </div>

                            This is Emmony's outline/prewriting packets for one of her OCs, Reika Titov. This is a character she hasn't played yet, but that should honestly show you a lot of what I mean about leaving intentional blanks in the outline. The stuff with the [[(color) SYMBOL]] is in our documentation a symbol from the game, but the character set here doesn't support those of course. We've got a font set that has them. <br/>This is a huge post, and also I'm going to tw/cw this for abuse, lesbophobia, and grooming, since Reika's story goes in some pretty dark directions.<br/><br/>[[RED SYMBOL]] Reika Athanasia Titov, the Warlock<br/>Age: 18<br/>Birthday: 3rd Week of Winter<br/>Height: 5'7”<br/>Weight: 165 lbs<br/>Academic Ability: Above Average<br/>Athletic Ability: Average<br/>Favorite Foods: Coffee Jelly, Matcha Tea, and Shadows<br/>Blood Type: O<br/>Animal: Bat<br/>Fun Fact: You thought your family would be happy with you for freeing them from the<br/>shadows beneath the shrine.

                            The Spiritual Journeys of Reika Titov<br/>1: You’re excited about the future. You’ve found or gotten involved in something neat!<br/>Result: Bored now? Or still awesome? You’ve gotten used to it either way.<br/><b><br/>Emma's Note: This part is the quest set Emmony builty for Reika, which is a further-refined dramaturgical structure that's used in each storyline, and it's largely interacting with mechanics, but it's important in understanding the story Emmony is writing here. It's a generic framework for the Reika's stories.</b><br/><br/>[[RED SYMBOL]]The Birdcage (40 XP)<br/>Something has changed in your life, or something is going to change soon. You're walking<br/>new paths, exploring new worlds, and for now, no one can stop you.<br/>Eventually though, all of this is going to pile up and you're going to realize that this<br/>probably really wasn't quite such a good idea in the first place.<br/>The HG can grant you 5 XP towards this quest when:<br/>– a bird takes wing in your heart, possibly in a dream or imagination spot;<br/>– you find yourself alone in a place of darkness and stars;<br/>– a friend or enemy shows you something dazzlingly beautiful;<br/>– you fight a duel in a place filled with roses.<br/>Once per chapter, you can earn a bonus XP towards this quest when:<br/>– you monologue while in a state of extreme emotion;<br/>– a monologue of yours is interrupted by an important obligation;<br/>– you are distracted from your negative emotions by something exciting or<br/>wondrous;<br/>– you dance in the moonlight, either alone or with someone else;<br/>– you argue passionately with someone who is distrustful of the new things in<br/>your life;<br/>– someone chastizes you for your past actions, but you're unaffected by their<br/>words;<br/>– someone chastizes you for your past actions, and you're affected deeply by their<br/>words;<br/>– something simple and honest you are doing is interrupted by the presence of<br/>something dark and fearsome;<br/>– the dark side of the new things in your life begins to make itself known.<br/><br/>2: Taking Charge<br/>You’re taking charge of a situation.<br/>Result: an enemy/opponent praises you, threatens you in a vaguely flattering way, or tries<br/>to recruit you.<br/><br/>Your Way<br/>You’re ignoring the pressures on you and just doing things your own way.<br/>Result: you’ve attracted dangerous attention and/or trimmed down the problem to an<br/>approachable space. Usually it’s both, one during the quest and one when it ends.<br/><br/>[[BLUE SYMBOL]]The Lens (40 XP)<br/>The barriers between reality and fantasy are always thin around you, but for now, they're<br/>even thinner.<br/>The things you want are in sight, and now isn't the time to question why you want them.<br/>Now is the time for action and adventure!<br/>The HG can grant you 5 XP towards this quest when:<br/>– a dream or nightmare becomes reality;<br/>– you play out an elaborate fantasy sequence of what you think your life will be like if<br/>only you could do successfully whatever it is you're doing. (This should typically be<br/>either comedic, tragic, or both);<br/>– things you didn't understand before start to more or less come into focus;<br/>– you fire a bow and arrow at an enemy (or perhaps a friend).<br/>Once per chapter, you can earn a bonus XP towards this quest through:<br/>– dreaming of the past or future;<br/>– doing something for no reason other than that you choose to;<br/>– parleying with dark and dangerous beings;<br/>– witnessing something you do not understand;<br/>– faking or exaggerating an emotional reaction;<br/>– taking decisive action against the problems you're facing in your life;<br/>– exploring or investigating a place or experience;<br/>– accidentally playing into the hands of your enemies'<br/>– giving it your all.<br/><br/>3: You’re in a confusing situation!

<b>Emma's Note: This next section is then an Arc by Arc breakdown of each storyline of Reika's, further refining the framework that the Spiritual Journeys quest set establishes to the actual usable stories. This bit gets stream-of-conciousness at times because she was typing as she was thinking everything out. The italicized sections are notes from an earlier outline that she included in this version to use as a starting point for developing the Arcs in detail.</b><br/><br/><b>Book 1: The Aspen Tree</b><br/>1► It’s hard to believe, but this part of your life actually happened.<br/><i>This Arc is about Reika making herself the villain, and trying her best to see it as something amazing and cool. She goes through lots of failed schemes, lots of villainy that ends up more heroic, that she tries to justify through some vague stupid excuse that makes it seem like she’s not just doing it to be nice.<br/>But she starts to get sick of that whole thing. She starts to process the fact that it really isn’t for her, even though she wants it to be.: But she starts to get sick of that whole thing. She starts to process the fact that it really isn’t for her, even though she wants it to be.</i><br/>Oki, so widely expanding on that basic idea -<br/>This book starts a little while after Reika became the Darkweaver, maybe a year. She has<br/>spent the past year really acclimating herself to what things are like now – her new powers, her basic experience as a Dark Walker, etc. She has mostly kept to herself during that time period, and has decided to really re-enter society. I am thinking that she might even start trying to attend school, but after being out for a year, things are very messy.<br/>There is a lot of rumour and stuff about what Reika was doing during her gap year. Lots of<br/>these rumours are very bad, and lead to her being kind of socially shunned. Reika tries to<br/>involve herself in [insert school club here], but things keep getting ruined by very very<br/>messy stuff. Reika gets shoved into the role of a villain, and tries to live up to the role, but<br/>then after a big scheme where she really hurts someone, Reika realizes that maybe being a villain is not what she really wants. She decides that when she graduates high school, she will change everything about herself completely and become a hero. A redefinition, in<br/>essence.<br/><br/><b>Quest 1</b>: Reika tries to get involved in [insert school club here]. She throws herself full-force into it. But everything keeps getting interrupted. Everyone keeps side-eying Reika, and she gets dragged into messy villainous stuff. She gets a bad reputation, and the club stuff by the end of this quest starts to seem very very messy and unworkable. This quest ends when Reika decides that if everyone is going to call her a villain, she might as well become one.<br/><b>Quest 2</b>: Reika throws herself into a big villainous scheme, I am thinking that it is probably<br/>something involving the Child of the Sun, who is part of some School-adjacent group.<br/>Maybe this scheme involves kidnapping her at an alumnus gala and doing something<br/>magically to seal her away to blot out the sun, or basically kill her in a symbolic way. This<br/>definitely visually involves shooting her with a bow and arrow. I think that Reika teams up<br/>with some sort of vampire alliance to do this, or rather that she is doing it for them. This<br/>quest ends when she does it and then the Headmaster of the Bleak Academy appears at her door to try to recruit her to the Bleak Academy. (This is, of course, deeply upsetting, along with the damage she just did to things.)<br/><b>Quest 3</b>: This quest gets very very psychological, as the labyrinth in it is completely Reika's troubled mindscape. This is represented by a complex puzzle box that she drew out of the Child of the Sun when she did whatever she did to her. In her final weeks of school, Reika works desperately to solve the puzzle and pass her classes, with the hope that the puzzle box will contain the answers she needs. When it comes down to it, the puzzle box is empty, and that is its own kind of answer. The answer that she is going to have to figure it all out herself.                        </div>

<b>Book 2: Oleander and Rosebay</b><br/>2► There’s some illusion or trick here.<br/><i>So then Reika tries her best to be nice. She tries her best to be more like a hero, even though society is trying its best to make her be a villain. She just wants you to like her! That’s all she really wants! But it’s all hard.<br/>During this Arc, she befriends a boy around her age named Mikhail Nemetov. His family is<br/>abusive, and Reika empathizes with him, and spends a big portion of the Arc trying to help him get out of his bad situation. They kind of have a bit of a romance, and Reika really connects with Mikhail. He becomes her only friend.<br/>And then Mikhail reveals his true intentions. He isn’t a sweet, shy teenage boy. (Well, he is still a teenage boy, but…) He’s a powerful enemy of the world, an Excrucian Deceiver, who created a family for himself to create a situation to lure Reika in, to gain her trust, so that he could do his best to convert her to his cause, to recruit her into a war against the world.</i><br/>So to expand upon this -<br/>Reika has finished her second-to-last year of high school. This book is set during her<br/>vacation. She's know as a hardcore villain for what she did to the Child of the Sun, but she's at this point very much not sure that was really what she wanted to do.<br/>Reika decides that she is going to become a hero. She (of course) does not process how<br/>impossible this will be, given who she is.<br/>Early on in this book she meets a sad boy her age named Mikhail Nemetov. His family is<br/>abusive, and this story centers a lot on Reika's romance with him, or rather, his courtship of her. She falls for it hook, line, and sinker because she is comphet-ing, and because he is one of the only people in her life who accepts her as a hero. Mikhail sees her as a hero first and foremost even, and what villain looking for redemption wouldn't obsess over the person who sees her as completely who she wants to be.<br/>This book really builds up to the reveal that Mikhail is not the sweet, shy boy Reika sees<br/>him as, but that he is an Excrucian Deciever who created a false family for himself to lure<br/>Reika in and gain her trust, so that he could try to recruit her into a war against the world.<br/><br/><b>Quest 1</b>: Reika gets excited about being a hero. She posits lots of ways that it could work.<br/>She meets Mikhail. She starts to crush on Mikhail. This quest is kind of just a glorious<br/>exploration of Reika's decision, but even it has a dark side. This quest ends when Reika<br/>makes a full decision to help Mikhail out of his abusive household.<br/><b>Quest 2</b>: This is about Reika helping Mikhail get out of his situation, and is very focused on their romance set-up. Reika does cool stuff, and ultimately, Reika gets Mikhail out of his abusive situation. This is accompanied by romantic music and confetti raining from the sky! (That may or may not be literal.)<br/><b>Quest 3</b>: I am thinking that this is about Reika unknowingly navigating Mikhail's<br/>complicated trap. Throughout this whole quest, Reika is not aware that Mikhail is<br/>dangerous (despite overwhelming signs). It is clear to the audience, with lots of dramatic irony, but it is something that Reika does not at all catch onto. This is basically their full-on relationship set-up, or rather explicitly Mikhail's seduction of Reika. This quest and book ends with them dating, and Reika in some deep ways under his sway.                        </div>

<b>Book 3: The Ebony Tree and the Shrike</b><br/>3► There’s something that rings false about the threats you face here.<br/><i>Reika traverses a literal labyrinth in this Arc. It’s a representation of her tangled-up emotions, the way she’s majorly torn between two ways of life – the life of a hero and the life of a villain, the Reika who is and the Reika who the world expects her to be. Mikhail is trying to corrupt her, and make her into a villain, which symbolizes in a way the world’s expectations of Reika.<br/>She reaches the center of the labyrinth, defeats Mikhail, and then she decides to just be who she wants to be, even if that’s not totally something consistent, and even if she can’t figure out how to make it work. She decides to just live for herself instead of listening to what people tell her to be.</i><br/>To expand -<br/><br/><b>Quest 1</b>: This is about Reika's new relationship. This is about her “bliss” with Mikhail. He's<br/>come into a lot of money he inherited from an old aunt or something. She is constantly on<br/>his arm, and he is constantly buying her fancy things, showing her off. Reika starts to think that maybe her shortcut into society could be through Mikhail. There is also, I think, a hasty proposal. But then as the honeymoon period starts to wear off, she starts to see the problems. She starts to see that things might not be as good as she is thinking, but none of it is really enough for a full indictment yet. Just enough to make her question.<br/><b>Quest 2</b>: Reika starts cheating on Mikhail with a girl. The girl does not like Mikhail, and tries to do her best to get Reika to dump him, but Reika insists that Mikhail is all she has.<br/>Meanwhile, Mikhail is really trying to influence and corrupt Reika. He is performing a<br/>flower rite with the goal of shoving an excruciated estate into her and making her a mimic.<br/>Mikhail tells her about his plans at the end of this quest – attracting dangerous attention<br/>and being praised by an enemy – but with how she's been during her secret affair, Reika<br/>actually starts to really deeply “what the fuck” about Mikhail.<br/><b>Quest 3</b>: This is Reika trying to get out of the cage of Mikhail's grooming and love. Reika<br/>trying to break out of things before Mikhail finishes his Flower Rite and uses her as the tool he needs to fight the world. This quest culminates with Reika breaking up with Mikhail before he finishes the Flower Rite, and deciding to stick her nose into stopping him.<br/><b>Quest 4</b>: This is a slow race towards the end of the Flower Rite, but every fight with Mikhail is a chance to be drawn back in again. This is Reika's confused flurry with everything on the line. And it ends with Reika stopping Mikhail from his Flower Rite, but he gets away.                        </div>

<b>Book 4: The Abraxas Rose</b><br/>4► The trick is about to be revealed.<br/><i>Reika embarks on a great quest, something very very upwards. I am leaning towards something that other heroes and villains are striving for as well. Something very mythic and Greek. She’s decided that this is the sort of thing she does these days. She’s decided that this is who she is. But what she’s not letting on is that part of her motivation is that she wants people to see her as a hero for doing this. She wouldn’t admit it, but somewhere in her subconscious, that’s the reason why.<br/>Reika reaches the target, completes the quest, is the one to complete it, before anyone else can, and because of it, she starts to become a bit more confident in herself, in her decision to be who she wants to be. She starts to get a bit more sure of herself, and returns home with her prize (which I’m conceptualizing as some sort of artifact or something).</i><br/>To expand -<br/>This new version very much involves the fact that Mikhail is still out there, and now that<br/>Reika is out of his grasp, he's just going to try to do this with another girl. This also involves the mythic hero quest that Reika thinks will help people see as a hero. She doesn't want to admit it, but that's a big part of what's going on. Yes, the actions she's taking are good, but they're by no means done for pure reasons. Parts of it are even motivated by hate and petty revenge.<br/>This book ends with Reika killing Mikhail in what is presumably saving the world, and the<br/>fanfare that comes along with this, or rather, the presumed fanfare.<br/><br/><b>Quest 1</b>: With Mikhail gone, Reika searches for a heroic quest she can take on to become a<br/>hero, to be treated as one. This quest has a lot of Reika trying out various tasks, the<br/>beginnings of several failed adventures that go wrong in Reika's trademark messy and nottotally-morally-good style. This quest ends with Reika finding out a large conspiracy with Mikhail at its center.<br/><b>Quest 2</b>: This quest focuses a lot on Reika fighting and investigating the shadowy<br/>organization Abraxas, which is basically Mikhail's mysterious villainous organization. She<br/>takes lots of decisive action, and starts to get to the bottom of the whole conspiracy, but<br/>then this quest ends when Mikhail comes back into Reika's life, asking her to join him in his schemes, and she pretty much falls for it.<br/><b>Quest 3</b>: This quest centers on Reika's time inside of Abraxas, trying to get out of Mikhail's clutches yet again. This quest has a lot of focus on the metaphorical labyrinth that is the internal politics of Abraxas, and on the labyrinth that is Reika's emotions. I am thinking that there is another girl who is Mikhail's intended vessel. Reika starts to fall in love with her, and kind of starts to realize that she needs to save her from Mikhail. This quest ends with Reika really properly challenging Mikhail and him fleeing to the spiritual realms with the girl, goading Reika into chasing him.<br/><b>Quest 4</b>: This quest focuses a lot on Reika's emotional state as she explores the spiritual realms in search for clues about Mikhail's whereabouts. At times, she considers leaving the other girl to Mikhail, but knows that in the long run that would make things worse. This quest culminates in Reika finding the location of Mikhail's chapel, and making preparations to descend into it.<br/><b>Quest 5</b>: This is Reika's final descent into Mikhail's chapel, her final descent into the maelstrom. Her final fight with Mikhail, her final challenge in breaking away from him. This quest is also very focused on the fact that Reika is very conceptually lost by the idea of ending everything with Mikhail. The fact that she uses her opposition to him as a sort of identity of her own, a place in the world, and that without him, that identity will be lost.<br/>And then deep in Mikhail's chapel, Reika and Mikhail fight one final battle, and she kills him in a moment of intense emotional catharsis.                        </div>

<b>Book 5: Wormwood's Flight</b><br/>5► ...and it’s going to change everything.<br/><i>Reika thought the hero-quest would make people like her, thought that they would start to see her as a hero because of it, but she was wrong. She’d been telling herself she was going to just do what she wanted to do, but she can’t help but get all caught up in what people think of her. She gets really depressed, and during this time has some weird, dark adventures that are a metaphor for her mental state. She gets hurt a lot, and fails a lot, and several times nearly dies.<br/>Then she actually dies, and is brought back by an outside force, then has to work to recapture her Blasphemy, shove it back inside of her and save everyone.<br/>After that transcendence of death, Reika takes a new lease on life. In the afterlife she saw<br/>something that really changes how she viewed things, that really changes how things work for her. She finds something there that allows her to actually live for herself and be happy. I think it’s likely rooted in the fact that she has a circle of friends already, but doesn’t really realize it. She has people who care about her. She just hasn’t noticed that they all actually care deeply about her. She’s had these people for a while, but her own thought processes have been holding her back. So then she lives for herself, and take care of her friends, and is happy.</i><br/>To expand -<br/>This is the point where Reika really has to face how lost she is. She thought she would be a hero, but the world is calling her fight with Mikhail an empty lover's quarrel. Despite<br/>having broken free of Mikhail, society still defines her by her relationship with him. And this is basically the story of how Reika breaks free of society's definitions of herself, which is also a coming out metaphor that is also literal.<br/><br/><b>Quest 1</b>: This quest focuses on Reika trying to enjoy her Mikhail-free life, but shadows and ghosts that represent both the shadow of Mikhail in her life, and society's perceptions of her haunt her. Reika tries to be excited about her life, but keeps getting brought down again, especially by the fact that society isn't treating her as the hero like she wanted.<br/>Society is treating her like an accessory. I mean, the parts of it that are not treating her as<br/>Mikhail's co-conspirator. After all, she is the girl who put out the sun for a while after<br/>trying to kill the Child of the Sun. This quest ends with Reika really losing sight of all the<br/>ways her life has improved and falling into despair.<br/><b>Quest 2</b>: This quest centers on Reika trying to do her own thing and ignore all of her problems. This quest is a time of false celebration and forced smiles. This quest is that confused attempt to say that your abuse didn't hurt you, in a vain attempt to avoid being defined by it. This quest closes on Reika having a dream of Mikhail telling her he's proud of her, and the whole thing feels to real, to the level where she wakes up crying and<br/>wondering if maybe he didn't really die.<br/><b>Quest 3</b>: This quest is about Reika trying to make sense of everything, trying to get to the bottom of the whether or not Mikhail is alive. A part of this is fueled by a desire to have him gone, but a big part of it also is fueled by a fucked-up sense of love. The desire to fix things, to make him better. The desire to kill him again and thus excise things forever. And then Reika finds her answers at the end of this quest. She realizes that Mikhail is dead, but a part of him will always be with her, because that shared abuse experience is never going to go away, no matter how much she wishes she could get rid of it.<br/><b>Quest 4</b>: This quest is about Reika taking it upon herself to take out the remains of Abraxas, ending it all once for all. This quest goes to a lot of very dark places, because Reika is still lost, even though she has come to terms with her history with Mikhail in a way. The scars still remain, and her life still hasn't been pieced back together, but this is maybe a last chance. This quest also delves a bit into some history, and addresses the fact that Reika still thinks she loves him, but that love is realistically a way of clinging to something that feels real. This quest ends when she fights the new leader of Abraxas and dies.<br/><b>Quest 5</b>: This quest is Reika's time outside of the world, primarily, her time dead. This quest is a time of painful transcendance. This quest is when Reika realizes that she doesn't love Mikhail, and that she never loved him. This quest is when Reika realizes that she's a lesbian. This quest is when Reika realizes that the world doesn't matter, and that the world doesn't get to tell her who she is, because she is the only one who gets to define that sort of thing.<br/>And then Reika returns to the world, pulls the shadows back into her kicking and<br/>screaming, comes out as gay, and finally starts living.<br/><br/><b>Emma's Note: And that's the end of her outline for that character!

                            I'll just make a brief not about something back in the thread : opposing impro and roleplaying is how it was phrased, but not how I see it. It's just that in some styles there's more acting, in some there's more narrative direction, and the two work more or less the same with regard to yes/no/but. <br/>But... there are other components still : achievement, success, is a big part of power fantasy.

Well, my point still being that "Yes, but" is a scale (just like, for example, railroading), and "No and/but" is merely a misunderstanding of how the "feedback" works. In my opinion, probably because roleplaying gamers have been taught to think in a succeess/failure perspective, where "failure" is the default state (ex. "Roll to succeed").<br/><br/> Blocking in improv = failure in roleplaying games. "Yes, but" = blocking.<br/><br/>From this perspective, I don't see the point of having three grades of blocking, and only one type of accepting, where "Yes, but" originally already includes both "No" options.<br/><br/>That said, I have nothing against blocking/failure because it has certain benefits.                        </div>

Care to expand on this? I don't really understand what you mean with the last sentence.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>On another side note, I do understand the concept that, for example, <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> brought up that stories are based (around conflict <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/438937/#Comment_438937" rel="nofollow">and aftermath</a> which means using) "No, and", and I love structures that are built around building on what has been previously established (which "and" implies). When I mention "building", I mean that someone builds on what someone just said or on things sowed earlier on. I think building is one of most important things in creating a healthy roleplaying game experience.<br/><br/>I mentioned earlier "No, because" to offer another situation that the participants need to overcome, but there could have been several solutions offered on beforehand. "Oh, it didn't work to bribe the guard. Lets try the former prison inmate instead".                        </div>

                            Rickard,<br/><br/>Those are some great compilations on your link, as far as what writers and dramatic theorists are saying about stories. Wonderful stuff!<br/><br/>I’m not sure I follow everything you’re saying about the “yes/no” categories, though. Would you try illustrating with an example, perhaps?<br/><br/>Emma,<br/><br/>Seeing that outline is definitely very instructive! I don’t understand the game’s terminology, since I’ve never read Chuubo’s (I assume that’s what all that is!), but the character arc information is, indeed, very detailed.<br/><br/>What I’m curious about is the process that you go through to get to that outline (especially in the context of this discussion). How can a player retain control over the character’s story without ever saying “no”? <br/><br/>Or is it, perhaps, that the option to say “no” is always there, but it’s just very rarely used, because you’re all so in sync with each other?                        </div>

I understand that there is an equivalence between "blocking in improv with a <i>yes, but...</i>" and "expressing failure in roleplaying games with a <i>no, because...</i>" and I understand your comment expressing doubts on whether there is a need for different grades of blocking (and, thus, for different grades of <i>no</i>) but I still think that for many players it does make sense to think in terms of the "pass/fail" dichotomy with intensity grades: "outstanding success/failure", "regular success/failure" &amp; "marginal success/failure".<br/><br/>This does not mean that all 6 categories must appear in a given game or have the same probabilities but it is a reasonable framework that answers the 2 basic questions about action resolution that the players usually ask: <i>Do I succeed in my intent?</i> &amp; <i>To what extent?</i><br/><br/>Many games can be analyzed using these categories: I think about the Powered by the Apocalypse family of games in terms of the <i>No, and...</i>, <i>Yes, but...</i> &amp; <i>Yes</i> trio of outcomes. The D00 Lite system is a roll-under  d100 system with doubles being a critical success/fail which maps rather nicely to the "No, and...", "No", "Yes" &amp; "Yes, and..." quartet of outcomes. Fu explicitly uses the 6 categories...<br/><br/>So, perhaps it is better to include just three or four of these outcomes in a given game, but not because the other two or three outcomes do not make sense but because they don't fit the kind of game you are designing.<br/><br/>In any case, in order to avoid confusions I think that we should restrict this discussion to the "graded pass/fail" interpretation of the "Yes, and..." and the "Yes, but..." expressions rather than to the "homonym but not synonym" interpretation that these expressions have in the "improv" context. Or, even better, we should use a different way to refer to these related but not exactly equal concepts like:<br/><br/>The 6 outcome scale: <i>Critical success / Regular success / Marginal success / Marginal failure / Regular failure / Critical failure</i><br/><br/>The improv dichotomy: <i>Blocking / Accepting</i><br/><br/>They are related concepts that work on different contexts and mixing them can be helpful up to a point.                        </div>

                            Paul, I'm confused on where one would need to say no. That's Emmony's character's story that she completely generated herself. My character who I play with Reika will have her own story that I generate myself, and Mors's character will also have her own story that she completely generates herself. <br/><br/>We write our own stories, then tell each other what we're going to do. We then weave our characters into other characters's stories as is appropriate. We run with the base assumption that the characters are friends at the start or will be friends, unless otherwise discussed from the start. So like, naturally they're going to interact with each other's shit because they hang out, but they don't have to at all times,   and there's a lot of scenes (probably 50-60% depending on the story) where the PCs aren't together.                         </div>

                            Ah! Great. Well, that’s the “no” in your “system”. You would not “yes, and” in that situation: it’s important to apply the “no” and get the fiction back into the state that’s desired.<br/><br/>It sounds like you do it very rarely, because you’re very in sync with each other, and because you have so many tools in place to get on the same page, but I’d say that it’s highly important to you that the option to say “no” is absolutely vital to your group (assuming I’m understanding you correctly).<br/><br/>So, while to an observer the group might seem to be accepting all contributions, there’s a potential veto hanging in the air at all times ahd it’s vital to assuring the game goes the way it’s supposed to.                         </div>

                            Yeah, definitely! <br/>I thought I said that earlier actually, but it's possible I might have been unclear, or I might have meant to say it but forgotten to actually do so.<br/>"No" is very notionally possible. It's just something that doesn't happen, so I'd personally call it irrelevant. It's also a deeply undesirable outcome that's a sign that something has gone drastically wrong.                        </div>

                            Yes, I think we understand each other. But, in a conversation about whether it’s good or possible or acceptable to “say no”, I would argue that it’s a really important distinction to make.<br/><br/>It’s not “irrelevant” just because it comes up rarely, for instance. In fact, it informs the whole structure you have chosen: I would say that a great deal (maybe most of!) the rules and structure you are using are all founded on the need to avoid that vital “no” function. That’s why you’re getting so much out of preplotting, for example, and why “play to find out” mechanics would hurt your game rather than help it.<br/><br/>Thanks for following this one all the way down the rabbit hole with me! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            That makes sense, although a big part of why "play to find out" mechanics would hurt our play outside of that is because the type of fiction we play isn't compatible with "play to find out". The whole genre just isn't possible with it, and an attempt at it would make an incomprehensible mish-mosh that fails to be any kind of magic realism, you know?<br/>And no problem!

                            I was gonna try and jump in here and try and help clarify but I was way to slow haha<br/><br/>I'm also only about 3% of the way through Chuubo's so it probably wouldn't have been very helpful, I'm just very excited about it already. It's so different than anything I've read before.<br/><br/>It's also funny because I complained the other day on here about how I was having some trouble with the Trollbabe game I've been playing with two other players. Those sessions are still some of the best I've ever played but I kept having these moments of feeling that maybe with a different set of tools we could be hitting a certain kind of experience more frequently. I think Chuubo's might have some answers for me.<br/><br/>One thing that really stands out to me is that in our Trollbabe game the PCs have only ever had one scene together. It seemed really important (read: different) to me that in Trollbabe the players could have separate scenes and separate stakes.<br/><br/>I think my players are really worried about blocking one another (we've played a lot of party based games), but having their own stakes where no other PCs are involved really helped them cut loose. Of course there's still a lot of player/character level blocking going on between me and the other players (since I'm acting as GM).<br/><br/>Anyway thank you for sharing those outlines <a href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">@EmmatheExcrucian</a> that was super helpful for me as I'm trying to wrap my head around everything. This thread in general has been really cool to read.

Personally I think I would have trouble participating in that convo just because the phrase “playing to find out” taken literally is so broad. I think in the context it was originally used (not that I know anything about that) it probably referred to a more specific creative agenda (to use another phrase I probably don't know the origin of). All of the games I've ever read leave something to be "found out" and establish other things up front. To be clear I'm still really excited to read that discussion <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            It’s not a strictly defined term! Merely a shorthand for a commitment to be open to different outcomes. (I’m opposition to, say, a GM who has a plot in mind, or any kind of play which allows one player to force a certain outcome over the others.) Hop on over there and ask about it if that doesn’t clarify matters (I don’t have much more to say about it, but someone else might!).<br/><br/>A big distinction that is important for this thread is that in “play to find out” play, blocking plays a different role. You don’t ever “say no” simply because you are trying to guide the game to a different outcome you’ve set your mind on.                        </div>

Marginal success and marginal failure are pretty much the same thing to me. "You get something but something bad happens." in opposite to "Something bad happens but you get something".

                            Rickard,<br/><br/>The reason I consider “yes, but” and any version of “no” to be different is because of how, in one version, the player’s idea gets incorporated into the game, and in the other it doesn’t. (This can be mitigated a bit in games where the player narrates a “no, but”, but not entirely.)<br/><br/>For example, player B wants to fool the Prince with a clever ploy. She rolls! On a “yes, but”, her idea - that the Prince is fooled, transforming the story (maybe we think of him as more of a fool now, and less as an intelligent man, for example) - gets worked into the story. The player’s idea is accepted, and the state of the story is transformed slightly. On a “no, but”, it doesn’t. Typically, the GM will come up with a “but”, but the player’s basic idea is rejected.<br/><br/>Over the long term, I find this to make a major impact on the game and the story - how much I put do the players have on what’s going on and how it’s happening?                        </div>

Thanks for clarifying, many discussions originate because people put different meanings on the same words...<br/><br/>I agree that in the improv context it makes sense to have a two step scale: "Blocking" &amp; "Accepting" although I'm no expert in improv and I don't feel qualified to decide whether "blocking" is better represented using the "yes, but..." or the "no, but..." expression so I will trust your expertise in this area and think in terms of "yes, and..." &amp; "yes, but..." as the two ways to continue a story in improv games/plays.<br/><br/>Regarding the 6 outcome scale for action resolution in RPGs... I can see how the "marginal success" and the "marginal failure" can be very difficult to distinguish in some games/scenes but I won't rule one of them out of the general framework since there are situations where they define different situations:<br/><br/><i>They are pursuing me, do I get away?</i><br/><br/><b>Yes, and...</b> You get away and their boss tells them to stop wasting their time chasing you like fools.<br/><b>Yes</b> You get away... by now. <br/><b>Yes, but...</b> You get away but you leave clues behind you and now they know where do you live.<br/><b>No, but...</b> They catch you but your friends are able to escape.<br/><b>No</b> They catch you all.<br/><b>No, and...</b> They catch you and one of your friends die during the chase.<br/><br/>The difference between a "Yes, but..." and a "No, but..." is whether you get away from your pursuers or not. Only after you answered that question you can add a negative detail in the first case and a positive detail in the second one, but only as long as they don't change the fundamental result of getting away (or not).<br/><br/>My personal opinion on the topic is that it is often difficult to come up with 3 different positive outcomes and 3 different negative ones for every single roll so it is faster and simpler to have less categories. This does not mean that these categories do not make sense or that I cannot distinguish them in general, it just means that the extra amount of detail that you gain by defining all 6 possible outcomes is not worth the amount of effort you need to make sure that they all are fundamentally different.<br/><br/>I'm currently advocating for the 4 outcome scale of: "Complete success", "Partial success", "Partial failure" &amp; "Complete failure" that cannot be mapped univocally to any 4 of the 6 outcomes. In some situations a "Complete success" will be a "Yes, and..." while in others it will be closer to a simple "Yes", in some scenes a "Partial failure" will be closer to a "Yes, but..." than to a solid "No", etc.<br/><br/>Having a coarser scale means devoting less effort to come up with truly different outcomes for any given scene and defining this scale as the product of two clear dichotomies: [success/failure] X [complete/partial] simplifies the task further.<br/><br/>This being said, not all games (and not all scenes in a particular game) require the same scale and that's why I justify the existence of the 6 outcomes scale as a general framework from which every designer can draw their own particular scale.                        </div>

That's why I wanted to talk about <i>abstract concepts</i> instead of giving examples. 2-3 are, for example, basically the same in your example. I don't think a scale with this many options actually helps/inspires, unless the result in itself breaks a chain of thought.<br/><br/>I can describe 2 and 3 to be the basically same thing as well.<br/><br/>2. <b>Yes, but...</b> "You get away but you leave your friend behind"<br/>3. <b>No, but...</b> "No, but your friend gets away".<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>2. <b>Yes, but...</b> "Yes, but you will be caught later"<br/>3. <b>No, but...</b> "No, but they will, at least, have to chase you for a while to get you".<br/><br/>In other words, a specific example doesn't help this discussion, especially one that is suited for your purpose only.                        </div>

Since it was pretty obvious that we where using the same words but we where thinking in very different concepts I expected an example to be useful (this is the main use case for examples, after all), not a straw-man-like fallacy to proof my point.<br/><br/>Indeed, what I was trying to proof with that example was that there are situations where all 6 outcomes are different and meaningful, and not that for every single roll, all 6 outcomes are different and meaningful or that we should use them as a mechanic.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Rickard" rel="nofollow">Rickard</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>2-3 are, for example, basically the same in your example</p></div></blockquote>
I have to differ. In situation 2 you are still on the run whereas in situation 3 you have been caught.<br/><br/>In the first case you will keep doing whatever your character was doing before the chase while maintaining a low profile (so you cannot use your usual assets to solve your problems). In the second case you will be in custody and you will have to stop whatever you where doing before to focus in escaping (perhaps asking your friends for help).<br/><br/>The next scene will not be the same, the character priorities will not be the same, the character situation will not be the same... they are different outcomes.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Rickard" rel="nofollow">Rickard</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I don't think a scale with this many options actually helps/inspires, unless the result in itself breaks a chain of thought.</p></div></blockquote>
I agree! I was advocating for a shorter list of outcomes as a mechanic and a complete list of outcomes as a design framework.<br/><br/>My point is that all 6 outcomes make sense and are essentially different so we should consider them all and then select the ones that we want to appear in our games. I don't think it is a good idea to have a mechanic that involves thinking 6 different outcomes for every roll because it is wasteful and boring but that does not mean that we cannot come out with 6 different outcomes for many situations, it is just not worth the effort.                        </div>

I think your "rewrite" is against the spirit of those rules - for instance, your "yes, but you will be caught later" is really a "no" in the context of this discussion, since the die roll (or whatever mechanic) is supposed to be determining whether the character is caught. The phrase "...you will be caught..." directly contradicts that. I'd consider those players to be cheating, if they interpreted the rules that way.                        </div>

Which is pretty much my point with this whole discussion.<br/><br/>[edit]<br/><br/>a) "Yes, but" can be anything of point 2-5.<br/>b) Few things normally controls this in any implementation that I have seen, because it's often open to anyone's interpretation how bad the "but" is. Is it a small drawback or a terrible one? What could be a slight drawback could also be the equivalent to a "No, and".                        </div>

I understand what you mean. I think more in progress where "gain some" and "loose some" can be in some sort of combinations. If I put improv aside, and talk purely about how I think when I talk about five/six outcomes:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://erebaltor.se/rickard/story-games/progressOfChallenge.png"/><br/><br/>Ranging from Anakin on the far left that tries to get away in a ship and also destroys ships along the way, in comparison to the far right, where Solo makes another blast door close when they try to enter a bunker.<br/><br/>I like the thought of partial success, but I have rarely seen it been implemented in a good way in roleplaying games. But this is far too off topic. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>

                            Rickard,<br/><br/>I still think you’re missing the point of what is happening between the players when they engage in this kind of mechanic.<br/><br/>Let’s say I was fighting a desperate battle inside the Death Star against the six-fingered man, who killed my father, ruined my life, and left me scarred for life. He is in the final stages of completing a death ritual that will open a gate to Hell and bring his beloved back to life.<br/><br/>I escape my bonds and leap upon him from behind, with a piece of jagged metal clutched between my bleeding fingers.<br/><br/>We roll (or whatever). If the rule is that, on my success, the result is a “yes, but”, then THAT BASTARD IS DEAD. Finally! <br/><br/>You do NOT get to say, “... but actually he still survives” - that’s breaking a fundamental social contract or understanding between you and I. That’s cheating and completely unacceptable: the players will probably flip over the table and quit the game in a rage.<br/><br/>Sure, you can say, “...but he manages to complete the ritual before he croaks,” though. That’s entirely legitimate.<br/><br/>Similarly, on a “no, but”, the six-fingered man survives, no question about it. <br/><br/>Those are absolutely and unambiguously different outcomes. And they’re important: for the last fifteen years I have been training for this. I’ve abandoned my family and my home to seek revenge. If he does not die, I have failed utterly.<br/><br/>I understand your broader point: they can both be interpreted as some kind of “mixed outcome” in the abstract, but in most actual moments at the table, there is some kind of important diegetic question on the table, and answering it matters (or we probably wouldn’t bother rolling for it).<br/><br/>That said, I’d love to hear your thoughts on partial success in RPG design. I think this thread is fairly well suited to that! It is the topic under discussion, after all.                        </div>

(In this style of game the plain “no” and the plain “yes” are both kind of bad; whereas in a sandbox game where the world is your oyster full of “offers” the plain “no” and the “plain” yes are the best because they don’t distract from the question that was asked—can I lift this gate?)</p><small>I’ve written about this before, <a href="http://www.rollspel.nu/forum/main-category/rollspel/228740-till-tv%C3%A4rstoppens-lov/page1" rel="nofollow">here on WRNU</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonWorld/comments/blvidf/running_dd_with_dw_style_agenda_principles_and/emrwub4/" rel="nofollow">here on Reddit</a>, but I think this post (yes this one you’re reading now) is my clearest take on it…?PS see also <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21073/four-mirror-scenarios-and-two-groups/p1" rel="nofollow">Four mirror scenarios and two groups</a>; what’s <strong>the only right thing</strong> in adventure games can sometimes be <strong>against the rules</strong> in impro and vice versa.</small> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Rickard" rel="nofollow">Rickard</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> </p><blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>In impro theatre: “I shoot you!” “Oh, damn, I’m hit!” is entertaining &amp; surprising to the audience.</p>Story games need to entertain &amp; surprise even the shooter.

                            In case it wasn’t clear before, I’m 100% with Sandra (2097). Well said!<br/><br/>The social dynamics are important, too. In an improv context, you say something and that’s your offer. I need to accept that to keep playing/acting. That’s the social contract we’re operating under. If I negate your input, I’m failing to honour what we agreed to do together.<br/><br/>In some/many RPGs, the social contract is, rather, that we have established some possible stakes and outcomes (he dies/he lives, perhaps) and we roll the dice to see which happens. If we fail to honour that, we are failing each other in the same way.                         </div>

Yeah, and the reason I ignored most of your post was that you talked about something else than blocking, namely offering. You CAN do both, which I wrote in the post I linked to. I can't really respond to something when you start talking about something else.

Yes, failure is blocking. "Do I succeed?" Dice tells me no. That's it; no path forward. Your examples just added offering on top of the blocking. You need to separate <i>offering</i> and <i>blocking</i>.<br/><br/>In all honestly, all you did was proving my point: that "Yes, but" and "No, but/and" are the same.                        </div>

I want people to start questioning instead of accepting "truths" about structures. The thread started with a structure with one positive outcome and three negative ones. If that what the game is about, then go for it, but <i>question</i> the structure of it. THAT IS why it's important to look at the <i>two</i> outcomes and what they do, possibly adding more granularity to it if wanted – to steer the way of thinking (like how <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/482019/#Comment_482019" rel="nofollow">InSpectres did it</a>).<br/><br/>It's just like "everyone" starts making skills when creating a roleplaying game, without questioning if you really need the skills ... or failure ... or a game master ... or conflicts ... or character sheets.                        </div>

                            I appreciate that, <a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a>.  And as I said before, I find most of your theorizing tremendously useful and insightful.  But we seem to disagree strongly on this.<br/><br/>I've explained in many places why I decided to give <i>DayTrippers</i> the resolution system it has (everything except straight NO): I wanted outcomes to be full of ad-hoc detail, and I wanted the emergent plotlines to have a jiggly dynamic in which narrative control shifts continually and a little unpredictably between the GM and Players.  Your responses seemed to give this decision short shrift.  Perhaps you are only talking about "more traditional" games and thus DT is exempted.  Maybe.<br/><br/>But it didn't sound (at first) like you were advocating for a questioning approach to the development of resolution systems; instead it sounded like you were flat-out categorically refusing to accept that anyone might see a value beyond the one-dimensional field of outcomes you repeatedly assert is all we need - or even that it's all we ever actually <i>are</i> doing, whether we realize it or not.  This last proposition is not only incorrect, but a bit insulting.<br/><br/>I am glad to see you backpedal a little bit, to a position of advocating consideration of such details, rather than a categorical denial that a particular technique has any real value.                        </div>

 I don't see "try again" or "try another way" as an offering, if someone fails. It doesn't give any new information.<br/><br/>I buy your case, however, if seen from your perspective.                        </div>

Right.<br/><br/>Or, more commonly:<br/><br/>"OK, here's my wife."<br/>"No, we're not married."<br/><br/><b>Very</b> different from "yes but I want a divorce" (and not that different from saying "I'm not playing this" and leaving the stage—which, ofc, is an available safety tool).<br/><br/>"Yes, but I want a divorce" ← great start to an awesome improv scene!<br/>"No, we're not married" ← goddag yxskaft? short cirtuit in reality

That's why we wanted to separate failure from offering, from acceptance, from anti-offering and from anti-acceptance. The "success/failure" axis is a different parameter, just as "high status / low status" is another important (and, similarly, not really blocking-related) parameter in improv.

These both sound like "yes, but" to me. Right?<br/><br/>In what context do they constitute blocking?<br/><br/>From my perspective, a "yes, but" can contextually become a form of blocking, but isn't necessarily so. Both of the "yes, but" examples here look like acceptance to me, except in rare situations where the player is committed to a certain idea ("I want to play out a happy marriage", or "I want a space battle"). (In fact, from an improv perspective, I'm not sure I can even distinguish either of these examples from a "yes, and".)<br/><br/>This seems entirely at odds with you claim (Rickard) that "yes, but" is a form of blocking. Can you help me understand?<br/> </div>

Exactly. I'm not sure why this would be blocking. (It's a good idea to try to avoid intentionally going against a fellow player/improviser's expectations, so as not to make things too hard for them, but it's very clear to me that, in both cases, the offer being made - "we're a married couple", "there's another warship over there" - is being accepted.)<br/><br/> </div>

                            Maybe those Improwiki examples was what was tripping me up;<br/>re-reading Johnstone now and to Rickard's credit, Johnstone doesn't really seem to distinguish between (what I call) blocking and (what I call) failure. In my own defense that distinction seems to me incredibly clear, vibrant &amp; fundamental.<br/><br/>I guess in Johnstone's context, (what I call) blocking is probably a pretty uncommon problem; he wasn't working with improers as bad as the Improwiki's examples or as bad as some of the ones I've worked with.                        </div>

                            Johnstone (Keith Johnstone, not <a href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">@Johnstone</a>, unless they are the same person) l  uses this example for (what he calls) blocking on p54:
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Impro" rel="nofollow">Impro</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Can I help you?<br/>Yes, I'd like a pair of shoes.<br/>Would these do?<br/>I'd like another colour.</p></div></blockquote>
This behavior falls outside of the definition I've used for "blocking" in this post, but apparently mr Impro himself Keith Johnstone disagrees.<br/><br/>Thanks again for the patience you showed working through this vocab hangup of mine, Rickard.<br/>Much appreciated.<br/><br/>(PS this is also why I like the Robin Laws' terms "petitioner" &amp; "granter". They wouldn't have tripped me up like this.)                        </div>

                            Of relevance here (though a deep hole to go down) is the Lacanian notion that the self interacts not with the object of desire itself, but rather with the <i>object a</i> - the motive <i>cause</i> of desire - and that pleasure is found not so much in the acquisition of the thing desired, but more fundamentally in the <i>act</i> of desiring.  The <i>demonstration and enactment</i> of desire produces a <i>surplus pleasure</i> which typically is not weakened but rather strengthened by frustration.                        </div>

                            Lacan is easily my most hated philosopher ← my immediate knee-jerk reaction after reading 13 words of your post. I just reeeeally hate Lacan. But I'll read the rest, brb…<br/><br/>… ok, back.  <br/>OK yeah in this case Lacan &amp; I were on the same page (note that we're saying "typically", not "always".  I would even back it all the way down to "often" instead of "typically").                        </div>

                            In this light, saying Yes and yes only is considered Blocking in impro. It's like the player being a deadweight. They are acknowledging the ball is there but not running after it. They are not acknowledging it as desirable. So you throw the ball (imaginary) at them : will they dodge ? act like they hurt ? make a big soccer pole sound (ventriloquy) while not budging ? Those deadweight players are calling it on themselves...<br/> </div>

You change the intention of what the first person contributed with.
<blockquote>Would these do?<br/>I'd like another colour.</blockquote>
"Yes, and" is not the only one offering new information. A "but" can come with offering, <i>and</i> I think it's so much more beneficial to always offer something when blocking (fail forward), <i>but</i> I would like to add a "because" <i>because</i> it changes the state of mind into automatically offering something.                        </div>

                            Yes.<br/><br/>BTW, in that particular example, Keith really wanted to sell something as soon&amp;straightforwardly as possible, because he then wanted to iterate on the exercise (redoing it with some sort of weird insult thing added); he was complaining about the players making it too interesting [through failure] so that they never got through that first "boring" iteration of the shopping scene.<br/><br/>Imagine in D&amp;D if the players go shopping for arrows and then they start going "I'd like these in another color" etc.♥<br/>Kinda interesting actually. But strange                        </div>
