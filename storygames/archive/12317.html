You do have to prep your dungeon beforehand, however. But it's not that hard to; what you really need is a floorplan and a prethought list of threats (the important part is, like Bangs in Sorcerer, that you've been <i>thinking</i> about appropriate threats, no so much that you've already got some, although that's nice too), and most everything else you can throw in on the fly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276431/#Comment_276431" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-16T14:22:22+00:00" title="June 16, 2010  2:22PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            E-mail sent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276495/#Comment_276495" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-16T17:36:18+00:00" title="June 16, 2010  5:36PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nitpick from the simulationist in me: clink armor should work super well against electrocution, just like sitting in a car.

I've debated that one back and forth. It's intuitive (if not entirely accurate) that the metal would conduct the electricity to your skin better than other clothes. Steel's relatively high resistivity also means that, at the levels of voltage we're talking about, the metal's going to get very, very hot - so should we convert the damage from Electrocution to Fire &amp; Burns? That's relatively realistic, but I don't like the idea of doing that; that's a whole different function for armor than what I had in mind.<br>(It was also my understanding that a car protects you from electrocution because it's not grounded, on account of standing on rubber tires.)                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276698/#Comment_276698" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-17T15:15:50+00:00" title="June 17, 2010  3:15PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sent in a message!

I guess they should strike when people are isolated.<br><br>It'll be a while till I can get the game going since I feel the players need to be at least a litle read up on it so the system feels natural. I'm a little confused by the range mechanics for the melee weapons, why not use the Rustbelt system of longest weapon wins in a open area and shortest in a closed/clinch?<br><br>The dungeon I'm working on is the metro of Rome, perfect for electrical hazards to push people into and mysteriously appearing trains. The stations lead to as different things as hospitals and airports and a volcano!<br><br>Btw I see you put my elephant in there as a monster <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Edit for some more thoughts:<br/>Why not have melee and ranged ranges be separate? Even with a really long hand to hand weapon you have to be close to hit someone who has a gun. The weapon reach could be relative to others of the same class. Since melee fighters will have to run up to most opponents anyway baking the movement into the Hit roll would make sense. If you Hit someone with a contact weapon you are now at your weapons range compared to him, when he tried to hit you back and has a different weapon reach it will probably penalize him (also you can't get to choose range because then two knife fighters would try to attack each other at long range to penalize the slower guy and not getting hit in a knife fight is really hard!). As it is now (if it read it correctly) if you miss someone with a melee attack you don't change position at all?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277117/#Comment_277117" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-21T12:03:14+00:00" title="June 21, 2010 12:03PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds like an excellent dungeon!

As for rushing up to people and stuff, that's supposed to be implied in the rolls &amp; reach modifiers and whatnot. Rushing at someone with a knife is bad because they've got more time to mount a defense; rushing at someone with a greatsword is good because by the time they notice, the sword's already there. Since combat isn't blow-by-blow but rather a few seconds of hacking, shooting, and running around, I thought it worked.<br/><br/>And, yes, if you fail your HIT roll, you don't get to change your position. You ran up, attacked, were parried and forced back. If the other guy used active defense though, he's supposed to be able to force you to change relative to him.

Too bad they're scattered all over the floor and picking them up will take an extended time. Worth: average<br/>A locked locker has ten hits of antibiotics: expensive (combine this with spending lots of threat on making people infected or having animals or monsters that fling poop or demonic bile so the players sweat over using their treasure or selling it)<br/><br/>Clothes store<br/>Seems like a gold mine, lots of clothes still hanging in there! Too bad they're filled with moths so as soon as you start poking about the room is filled with a swarm of moths that makes people choke. Under a bit of collapsed roof there is a mummified clerk still holding a good set of sharp clothes: average worth.<br/>A casual but nice dress is there but it's still tagged (pulling it off sprays ink over it lowering the worth to cheap from average) and passing the alarm things sets off the alarm. Security robots or just alerting everyone in the dungeon of your location? Bad either way!<br/><br/>Sportswear store<br/>The entrance is blocked by a wall of fire, either magical or from a gas leak. Jumping through it causes fire damage. The real crux is the sneakers and jogging suits you loot from the store will melt or go up in flames on the way out unless you circumvent or shut the wall down somehow.<br/><br/>Food store<br/>The air is heavy with miasma from rotting food. It's choking! The candy is still in food shape and a heavy worth of it is worth average. A sign outside says gold bars are now half price! The remaining gold bar (top dollar!) are inside guarded by a monster.<br/><br/>An escalator is operating at hyper speed! MOVE to ascend or descend safely or suffer accidental damage.<br/><br/>A restaurant has some nice looking paintings. They are all worthless. Except one which is cheap. Cutting it out of the heavy frame is a mistake though since the frame is expensive!<br/><br/>A fountain is surrounded by skeletons reaching for it. The water is so delicious even dead people want to drink it. Also it's spiked with an analogue of Hero so there's a risk you overdose.<br/><br/>A flock of birds fly overhead and try to poop on the crew increasing the risk of infection if they have wounds.<br/><br/>The liqour has had all its bottles smashed and is covered floor to cieling in liqour, a single spark will set it ablaze.<br/><br/><b>Golden Guardian of Commerce</b><br/>A mechanical monster which is an animate statue of Hermes cast in brass. It's feet are firmly planted on a base which can move around on tiny wheels. It gives off tremendous heat and can shoot lasers from its eyes and when it thinks the fight is going badly it will cross its arms and do a countdown before blowing up in a large explosion (rolling after the biggest grouping of people).<br/><br/>Threat cost 13<br/>Weakness: can't roll up stairs (make sure the mall has an elevator or something as well as the stair, nice tactical element, do they want to sabotage the elevator to more easily escape the GGoC?)<br/>Armed and dangerous (brass fists, blunt+1 shortest)<br/>Destructive (smash its way through walls and doors)<br/>Armor (brass skin, edged-1, brawl-1, blunt-1, gun-1, fire-1)<br/>Supermechanical strength<br/>Thermal imaging<br/>Heat<br/>Sudden flash of radiance (daze room)<br/>Cold blooded (immune to heat)<br/>Recharge (battery 20 max)<br/>Touch attack fire-1 (it's really hot!)<br/>Self destruct II (large explosion, 1 turn countdown)<br/>Ranged attack long fire (laser from eyes)<br/>Power attack (charge its laser eyes two rounds for a fire+2 attack)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279920/#Comment_279920" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-09T17:13:58+00:00" title="July  9, 2010  5:13PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Krippler</cite><br/>A fountain is surrounded by skeletons reaching for it.

My first step towards addressing it is this:<br/><br/><b>MADCORP PLAYER ADVICE</b><br/>This is advice for players, but the Ref better read it too, and make sure that he doesn\u2019t pull some shit that makes this stuff non-viable. For serious: just because you\u2019re the Ref and all, doesn\u2019t mean you can do whatever and still expect it to be fun.<br/><br/><b>Don\u2019t Make Characters in Your Head</b><br/>Do not sit down for chargen with a pre-created character concept in your head. Just don\u2019t fuckin\u2019 do it, okay? Randomly generate them as per the rules. Spend hiring points for better aptitude rolls if you get a guy that seems useful but has one or two aptitude scores that kinda suck. Spend hiring points for specific classes when you need a specific class for tactical reasons (e.g. field medicine, or you just figured out a cool synergy tactic), or when you roll up a statblock that would be totally awesome for a Tank or whatever. Don\u2019t like the guy you just generated? Don\u2019t hire him, do another. It doesn\u2019t take that long.<br/><br/><b>Use More Than One Character</b><br/>Remember how I said you can control more than one character? Do it. Bring at least two on each job until you\u2019ve got a reliable veteran. Roleplay the one you like to roleplay, and let the other just be a pawn.<br/><br/>Seriously, fuckers can get dropped like that. Sometimes all it takes is one hit. You need to have a backup, so you don\u2019t have to sit out.<br/><br/><b>Use Armor</b><br/>Eventually, you\u2019re gonna get hit. If you\u2019re not wearing armor, guess what: you\u2019ll probably die when that happens.<br/><br/><b>Only Get Attached to the Survivors</b><br/>Let your character identification and attachment develop over time to the characters that survive multiple jobs. \u2018Cause, A) face it, bitches get tossed to the side, and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> the ones that survive over multiple jobs are more likely to survive in the future due to experience perks.<br/><br/>Chargen is intended to take near-zero effort for exactly this purpose: you aren\u2019t supposed to be immediately attached to the product. You make some rolls and a handful of choices, and you\u2019ve got a guy who\u2019s already effective without any strategizing effort, and who\u2019s got enough character in a stereotypical way (class, physique, clothing style) to be roleplayed in a stereotypical way. Which is all you need \u2013 if you want deep characterization, play my other game, The Rustbelt.<br/><br/><b>It\u2019s Not About Fighting</b><br/>You know those dungeoncrawl games that go like this?<br/>1.\tKick down the door.<br/>2.\tKill the things inside.<br/>3.\tTake their stuff.<br/>4.\tRepeat<br/><br/>This isn\u2019t one of \u2018em. While that can happen, it\u2019s not the default procedure. You\u2019re going to be doing a lot more investigation of things, scouting for hostiles, improvising to take down hostiles without direct conflict, sussing out risks and only facing those that can be minimized or promise to be lucrative, and exploring.<br/><br/>\u2018Cause a dungeon isn\u2019t a series of encounters. It\u2019s a solid environment for you to move around in freely. It\u2019s not about fighting; it\u2019s about interaction.<br/><br/><b>Don\u2019t Assume Your Guy Is Built for Combat</b><br/>I\u2019m not sure where this comes from, but some people seem to have this idea that every class is or ought to be viable for combat in some way. And I\u2019m like, bwuh? What the fuck were you thinking, letting your Sawbones go toe-to-toe with a bear? He can use medical implements as weapons in case he absolutely has to, or in case a golden opportunity arises. <br/><br/>This isn\u2019t the game where everybody\u2019s a fighter, except there\u2019s one guy called \u201cFighter\u201d who kills things faster. The Conflict Resolution department [ne\xe9 Killers &amp; Muscle] is for combat. Some of the other guys have skills that are useful in combat, or are good in support of a CR guy or two, or enable them to fight a little in dire straits, but they aren\u2019t meant to be able to hold their own in a violent conflict over any meaningful timeframe. It\u2019s not their department.<br/><br/>Running and hiding are viable options, and should always be considered.<br/> <br/><b>Exploit Those Skills</b><br/>You know how in some games, when you use lateral thinking and figure out this crazy synergy between two weak spells that enables you to take down a dragon painlessly and safely without blowing your good resources, how the GM gets mad at you and doesn\u2019t let you do it? Yeah, that\u2019s NOT how this game goes.<br/><br/>You\u2019re supposed to find crazy, exploitative uses for your characters\u2019 skills. You\u2019re supposed to try to find ways to handle problems painlessly and safely. In this game, that\u2019s called playing well.<br/><br/>The skills all have some default functions and cases in their write-ups, but they\u2019re not limited to that. I mean, the Gloomdoll can conjure strong yet elegant strands of spiderweb and lace to wrap people up, and that\u2019s all the book says about it, but that\u2019s not the only thing he/she/it can do with that skill. Use your imagination. Think sideways. That goes for everything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_298722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298722/#Comment_298722" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-29T02:50:55+00:00" title="October 29, 2010  2:50AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm just dying to play this for real but it seems old school gamers are a dying breed around my parts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298820/#Comment_298820" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-30T06:19:09+00:00" title="October 30, 2010  6:19AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having that player advice written out will improve the game significantly!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, having played and ran a few MADCorp games, I'm thinking the "Use more than one character" rule should be built into the system itself somehow... Or rather, be built into the system itself better, because in a sense, it already is, in the negative way - if you <i>don't</i> make more than one character, sucker's gonna die or lay on the floor bleeding for like a gazillion turns.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it needs more positive support, too! Making *one* MADCorp character is easy and fun (keeping *track* of one MADCorp character is not so easy or fun). But, as has been established, the "item under player-control necessary for proper play" is not a character, but a set of characters. Which is not so easy to do (professions, aptitudes and gear for two-four guys! Times number of players!) but still fun (combos!). Keeping track of twelve characters and their CRAP at a time in a single game, though? Ugly business, as it is now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and Exploit Those Skills needs a whole section in the text! What do I do as Ref? When do I say yes? When do I say no? When do I say hmm let me think about it? What do I do as a player? When do I need to bring this up? Before the relevant situation, after it, what?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI get what "Don't make characters in your head" is supposed to do, but I think it's a liiiittle bit misguided. In fact, my first reaction was "Well, then where the hell am I supposed to make them?" If I roleplay a character in depth, doesn't mean I designed him pre-play. Could be I rolled him up and found him awesome (or idiotically incompetent and a pathetically amusing meatshield) and invested in him after the fact. Still, there's the fact there was investment, and when I lose that character - even the one I planned to lose and prepared to lose - it's still going to hurt a bit. Hell, even if I just follow the advice as written, it's still going to suck as hell to lose any of my 'survivors' - which is going to happen eventually in MADCorp, no? I think you'd do better by acknowleding that instead of going all 'no-no', and allowing some sort of REVENGE missions to get even with whatever it was that "offed my guy."<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also a hodge-podge of squirming little things in my head that I don't quite know how to get out. Having played a few MADCorp games, I basically have two things: 1) A strong desire to play what I see the as your vision of the game; 2) An equally strong sense of frustration whenever I try to play or run the game as written.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't fully know why.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299368/#Comment_299368" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-04T15:51:58+00:00" title="November  4, 2010  3:51PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 4, 2010 3:52PM by Marshall Burns.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DWeird</cite>(keeping *track* of one MADCorp character is not so easy or fun)</blockquote>\nYeah, I'm working on that <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  The Trauma Track is getting revamped, for one thing. I'm gonna eliminate the "Maiming" set as a separate thing, and merge it with the Minor -&gt; Grievous -&gt; Severe thing. Basically, when you take a wound you'll also get an effect that corresponds with the level of the wound (and with the weapon used to do it). The maiming stuff will all be subsumed into Grievous and Severe wounds (along with some other stuff). New charts and damage tables will make this easy (hopefully).<br><br>I'm trying to figure out a way to simplify Wear &amp; Tear, but I haven't arrived at it yet.

As for what you can fit on one page, I have no intention of "character sheets" in this being one-pagers. You'll have a page for your aptitudes, traits, physique, etc., and one for CRAP, and one for experience, and the Trauma Track. I figure that each class is also gonna need its own -- for instance, the Helter Skelter is going to need check boxes for his firepower, and the Maddog for his drugs, and the Gloomdoll will need a checkbox that says, "Is your hair and makeup okay?", and so on. I find no problem with numerous sheets, as long as they can be distinguished at a glance and they're all easy to use. (For instance, I have to figure out a CRAP sheet that makes Burdens and Wear &amp; Tear easy.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300378/#Comment_300378" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-11T06:50:02+00:00" title="November 11, 2010  6:50AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Random suggestion:<br/>\n<br/>\nThere should be a section for the Ref titled "Give out +1s when..."<br/>\n<br/>\nOn that list, whatever else it contains, there should be: "When the players are introducing a brand new insane plan, give them +1s to all the rolls."<br/>\n<br/>\nAside from being a straightforward "Do new things, players!" incentive, it takes some edge off experimenting with various strategies - there's a chance the players would just find one strategy that works and grind it...

Like this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Krippler</cite>Does your strat depend on an open flame? Just have a bunch of snowmen freeze everything up. Does it depend on being methodical and slow? Introduce dungeons with a semi hard time limit with the distant threat of it crumbling and if not burying the dungeoneers all the treasure.</blockquote>\nSee, for me, once I figure out how to beat something, it's boring to have to do it over and over again. But constantly having to figure out new strategies, that's fun and rewarding.<br><br>For that reason, I'm leery of saying "Give +1s when the players try a new and crazy plan." Whatever Gamist games have that's the equivalent of a Fruitful Void, that's MADcorp's right there.<br><br>On the other hand, the thing that Jesse wrote in the roleplaying rewards thread about Sorcerer's bonus dice -- the way he takes them as a literal, finite, non-repeatable checklist -- seems really good to me. Like:<br><br>[ ] Did the players engage in humorous or otherwise amusing banter in the process of cooking up their action plan?<br>[ ] Does this plan utilize the circumstances in an unexpected or especially clever way?<br>[ ] Are you personally impressed by the players' ingenuity?<br><br>...and so on, and then say, "For each box you just checked, give +1." Or, probably, for every two boxes, 'cause +1 is a lot.<br><br>EDITED TO ADD:<br>The grinding thing is, by the way, the major spot where MADcorp differs from Old School dungeon play. Having to say, "I tap the floor with a ten foot pole to check for pit traps" in every damn corridor really grates. I mean, come on! We've figured out that we can avoid pit traps in this way! Either stop it with the pit traps, or assume that we checked with the damn pole. Or have a gnome steal it so we have to figure out another way to check for pit traps. <i>Something</i>.
