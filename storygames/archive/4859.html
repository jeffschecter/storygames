Out of the blue, I get a visit from a friend of mine named Steph, we get talking about roleplaying games, and she tells me that some old friends in the area are pining for more games.  <br/><br/>Well, I tell her about some of this indie stuff, and she's really excited by it, especially the idea of people stepping up and doing more or less GMing scene-to-scene depending on whether they feel like they want to.  She says she'll put together the group if I will write the game.  <br/><br/>From the d20 side, the parameters:\n<ul>\n<li>Characters are defined and conflicts played out in a format that's recognizeably d20 (a cozy blanket for D&amp;D players)</li>\n<li>Uses some kind of feat-like mechanic to mechanize little things that are important to the player.</li>\n<li>Runs fast and takes the book-looking away.</li>\n</ul>\nFrom the indie side, the paremeters:\n<ul>\n<li>Universalis-like Teneting phase to design the world.</li>\n<li>Scene Framing and GMing duties are done on a per-scene basis with the ability for people to pass.</li>\n<li>Uses my Raising the Stakes rules (Conviction, Death Flag, Raising the Stakes itself)</li>\n<li>A "woah hold up" veto mechanic for things that squick.</li>\n</ul>\nI've got a few things whipped up for this, Steph loved the fact we called it Quilt.

In order to save space, a hobby abbreviation is used to refer to the twenty-sided die from here on out, classifying the die by  referring to the number of sides on said die preceded by a lowercase \u201cd\u201d \u2013 thus a d20.<br/><br/>When you are asked to roll a d20 and read  the result in these rules, you will merely roll said die and read the numerical value that is showing on the side of the die facing up. For example, if you roll a d20 and the number three is facing up, then the result of the die roll in question is three. Simple, no? <br/><br/><b>how to roll the die</b><br/><br/>When a player wants their character to perform a certain action under duress (be it striking a character in combat, deciphering an ancient scroll, or trying to shrug off the effects of a bad cold), they will need to roll a d20 as outlined above and add some numbers to the die roll result that they generate. <br/> <br/>The numbers that a player adds to the result of such a die roll are their character\u2019s level and any die roll bonuses granted by their character\u2019s relevant traits. Broad traits grant a +1 bonus to die roll results, while narrow traits grant a +3 bonus to die roll results. All such bonuses are cumulative. <br/> <br/>A player always wants to roll as high as they possibly can. Specifically, the player will need to generate a final die roll result that equals or exceeds a difficulty class (or \u201cDC\u201d for short) assigned by the GM to the action that the player\u2019s character is attempting to perform. <br/> <br/>If the player generates a die roll result that meets or exceeds the DC of the action whose outcome is in question, then their character successfully performs the action, with the GM narrating the outcome accordingly. If the player fails to generate such a result, then the outcome of the action hinder the player instead, with the GM describing the exact nature of the hindrance. <br/> <br/>Finally, die roll results of natural (i.e., unmodified) 20 always indicate an automatically successful action attempt, while die roll results of natural one always indicate an automatically disastrous action attempt. Naturally, you want to roll more results of 20 than you do results of one during actual game play. <br/><br/><b>when to roll the die</b><br/><br/>A player only needs to roll the die when their character is trying to perform either an action under duress (i.e., when a character, monster, or force is bearing down on them) or when what they are attempting to do falls outside of their areas of expertise (e.g., a Saxon warrior attempting to decipher a Latin scroll or a 15th Century warrior trying to drive a 25th Century Battle Wagon).<br/> <br/>If a player\u2019s character is not under duress and the action they are attempting to perform is specifically related to an area of expertise that they have ranks in, then it is automatically successful (treat the situation as if the player had generated a die roll result of natural 20, as discussed previously). <br/><br/>Continued. . .                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh" title="jdrakeh"><img alt="jdrakeh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/909/nZA3BEK4G6OHW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh">jdrakeh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109044/#Comment_109044" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-20T19:51:15+00:00" title="November 20, 2007  7:51PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2007 7:51PM by jdrakeh.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            . . . continued. . . <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>combat</b></span><br/> <br/>The term \u201ccombat\u201d in this system could refer to a sword duel, gun battle, or even a heated public debate \u2013 so long as there are two or more parties attempting to achieve a clear victory over one another, a given situation qualifies as \u201ccombat\u201d. <br/><br/>Combat is, for the most part, simply a series of actions, resolved using the basic rules discussed previously. Having said that, these actions must be structured in order to alleviate any confusion during play.<br/><br/><b>the combat turn</b><br/><br/>During a given combat, time is divided into combat turns. During a combat turn, a character may attempt to perform one action (e.g., strike their opponent with a melee weapon, cast a magic spell, deliver an impassioned plea for mercy, etc). <br/> <br/>After all characters participating in a given combat have performed their allotted action in a given combat turn, that turn is over and a new combat turn begins. <br/><br/><b>the order of action</b><br/><br/>During a combat turn, the players of all participating characters must roll a d20 and add their character\u2019s level and any bonuses granted by related traits to the die roll result. Characters act in descending order of the die roll results generated on their behalf, from highest to lowest. Any ties should be re-rolled before proceeding to the resolution of actions being taken. <br/> <br/>Acting order can be determined once at the beginning of a given combat or, alternately, at the beginning of every combat turn. Ultimately, the GM and the other player should decide which of these two methods works best for the game being played. <br/><br/><b>striking an opponent</b><br/><br/>Striking an opponent with a weapon (e.g., sword, handgun, or offensive spell) in combat is a simple matter of a player stating that they wish to do so, rolling a d20 per the basic rules, and meeting or exceeding the DC assigned to the strike attempt by the GM (in combat the default DC to strike another character is 13). <br/><br/><b>ending a combat</b><br/><br/>A given combat is over when one side of the conflict, be it an individual or group of individuals, has been defeated or forced to concede victory. So long as two opposing forces are still actively engaged in conflict with one another, combat continues.<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Caveat</span></b><br/><br/>This is a quick copy and paste of EZ20's core rules. Character creation is also complete. Still working on the rules for the GM (assigning DCs, etc). The final product will be 100% OGC, even the title. If any of this (or subsequent snippets) make into the quilt, I'd prefer that any kind of formal publication (free or otherwise) credit said snippets as being lifted from EZ20 (per the OGL).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh" title="jdrakeh"><img alt="jdrakeh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/909/nZA3BEK4G6OHW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh">jdrakeh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109048/#Comment_109048" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-20T19:57:07+00:00" title="November 20, 2007  7:57PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2007 7:58PM by jdrakeh.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>From EZ20 sidebars. . .</b></span><br/><br/><b>About Equipment</b><br/> <br/>Mundane equipment has no mechanical value. Your character will need to be holding a sword in order to swing one, though it is merely a prop. Likewise, in order to pick a lock, your character will need a set of lockpicks handy, though they don\u2019t otherwise impact the action attempt. <br/><br/><b>What about classes, feats, etc?</b><br/> <br/>Classes, feats, races, and skills are simply traits that perform specific functions in the games that utilize them. Under these rules, classes and races become broad traits, while feats and skills become  narrow traits. A class or race converted to a broad trait bestows its bonus upon all action that said class or race is well known for in the source material. Similarly, a feat or skill converted to a narrow trait bestows its bonus upon the action that said feat or skill specifically applies to in the source material.<br/><br/><b>What about Saving Throws?</b><br/> <br/>Saving Throws can be easily incorporated into these rules, if you so wish. If a certain spell effect (see <i>Magic</i> for more details) or attack type specifies that the target is allowed to make a Saving Throw, the player of that character simply needs to make a die roll per the basic rules and add the bonuses of any traits which may help them resist the effects of the spell or attack in question. The default DC for such a roll is the die roll result that was generated by the attacking character to resolve the strike.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109049/#Comment_109049" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-20T19:57:59+00:00" title="November 20, 2007  7:57PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>Everything has hit dice.</blockquote>\nWow, I could totally do that.

For example "If I hit the goblin, he falls unconscious and his buddies are shocked into hearing us out, if I miss, they swarm me and I've take three attacks on me right away."  If that's acceptable to the GM (or in Quilt's case, the table), then you resolve the action normally with the new consequences.  The GM / table becomes the filtering mechanism if stakes are too favorable or odds too one-sided... they just decline.<br/><br/>Anyway, the stuff I've cooked up for this uses Raising the Stakes a lot and guts most of the rest of d20.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109052/#Comment_109052" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-20T20:11:55+00:00" title="November 20, 2007  8:11PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdrakeh</cite>the basic mechanics</blockquote>\nWell, Steph was pretty keen on "recognizeably d20" and we agreed that that meant "Xth Level Y Z" had to have a strong, mechanical meaning.

As you say, the way to do conflict resolution is as a series of tasks, with a stake of death or capture (and other interesting stakes from your hack).  The key to making it work, I think, is to realise that the tasks don't need to be directly relevant to the conflict, they can be whatever dungeon you've brought to play with this week.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh" title="jdrakeh"><img alt="jdrakeh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/909/nZA3BEK4G6OHW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh">jdrakeh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109054/#Comment_109054" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-20T20:18:21+00:00" title="November 20, 2007  8:18PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite><cite>Posted By: jdrakeh</cite>the basic mechanics</blockquote>\nWell, Steph was pretty keen on "recognizeably d20" and we agreed that that meant "Xth Level Y Z" had to have a strong, mechanical meaning.

That said, EZ20 <i>does</i> have levels.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109056/#Comment_109056" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-20T20:28:50+00:00" title="November 20, 2007  8:28PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2007 8:30PM by Ry.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, so here's the deal:<br/><br/>Everything in the game has 6 Stats, a Level, and some Features (Features are like feats or equipment or other mechanized stuff).  <br/><br/>The 6 stats are D&amp;D's:  STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA.  <b>Edit:</b> Generated by rolling 3d6 and dividing by 2.  <br/><br/>Those aren't usually used for actions, however, since Level is such an important concept.

Your character has a Level, as in "6th level Human Barbarian"  So you add 6 to any stat to get what you'll roll on an action.  That said, you could get away from them - have each of Might, Reflex, etc. start at Level and then add to that.  But then you've taken away the warm blanket effect: You have stats just like in d20, and can convert d20 characters to this very quickly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109063/#Comment_109063" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-20T20:55:27+00:00" title="November 20, 2007  8:55PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2007 9:02PM by Ry.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a statblock (without any Features)<br/><br/>Kang, Level 4 Dwarfin' Teef<br/>STR: 5<br/>DEX: 4<br/>CON: 6<br/>INT: 6<br/>WIS: 5<br/>CHA: 4<br/><br/>Might: 9 (STR 5 plus Level 4)<br/>Reflex: 8 (DEX 4 plus Level 4)<br/>Fortitude: 10 (CON 6 plus Level 4)<br/>Insight: 10 (INT 6 plus Level 4)<br/>Will: 9 (WIS 5 plus Level 4)<br/>Style: 8 (CHA 4 plus Level 4)<br/><br/>Hitpoints: 24<br/>Conviction: 6                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109064/#Comment_109064" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-20T21:04:46+00:00" title="November 20, 2007  9:04PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could also generate those stats (STR, DEX) with 1d6+3 for some heroic characters or 1d8+1 for more average folk                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh" title="jdrakeh"><img alt="jdrakeh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/909/nZA3BEK4G6OHW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh">jdrakeh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109065/#Comment_109065" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-20T21:32:17+00:00" title="November 20, 2007  9:32PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2007 9:38PM by jdrakeh.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>Your character has a Level, as in "6th level Human Barbarian"  So you add 6 to any stat to get what you'll roll on an action.</blockquote>\nThat I like -- but that's not what your're posting. You have a seperate and distinct list of secondary traits (Might, Reflex, etc) that are essentially duplicates of the core stats (STR, DEX, CON, etc) with different names. What I was proposing is that you dump one or the other and simply add your level to X score, as you state here -- rather than generate ability scores, then duplicate them under other names, and add your level to those duplicates. In your model the six core stats and the "real deal" traits are mechanically identical. There's no reason (that I can see) to include both.<br/><br/>What I propose is that a character has six stats: \n<ul>* Might <br/>* Reflex <br/>* Fortitude<br/>* Insight <br/>* Will <br/>* Style</ul>\nEach of these has a score generated as you propose that core stst scores be generated. When attempting to perform a task, you add your level to the appropriate score. Or, alternately, each character has six stats: \n<ul>* STR<br/>* DEX<br/>* CON<br/>* INT<br/>* WIS<br/>* CHA</ul>\nAnd each of <i>these</i> scores is generated as previously proposed, with a player adding their character's level to the appropriate stat when resolving action. <br/><br/>I simply, given your statement that one set of these stats isn't used during actual play very often, don't see the need for <i>two</i> sets of stats that are fundamentally identical on the mechanical level.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109066/#Comment_109066" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-20T21:42:33+00:00" title="November 20, 2007  9:42PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdrakeh</cite>There's no reason (that I can see) to include both.</blockquote>\nThe same reason that you show the full Reflex Save in d20 instead of Dex Bonus and "Bonus due to level" listed separately.

It gets right to what matters in the game and dumps the superfluous stuff that only gets used once. Incidentally, I went the other route with Simple20 (I included base stats, though only the actual modifiers ended up getting used in actual play) and, in retrospect, after much feedback, I realize that it was a mistake. I originally went with that option  for the same reason that you initially decided to go with two sets of stats (i.e., the familiarity angle). <br/><br/>What I found was that those people who were already familiar with d20 didn't <i>need</i> the stats -- they knew what was up and the blatant hand-holding put a lot of them off. They liked the point-buy, they simply wanted the point-buy to apply directly to modifers, side-stepping the stats altogether (as True 20 did it). If I did it again (and there are some plans for that waaaaaaay down the road), I'd go this latter route.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109213/#Comment_109213" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-21T16:34:52+00:00" title="November 21, 2007  4:34PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 21, 2007 4:35PM by Ry.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Patterns and Power</b><br/><br/>Power is the currency of Game Mastery, and everyone starts with 20 at the beginning of the campaign.  First, there's a general round-robin chat.  Then, going clockwise starting with a randomly determined player, players can pitch their ideas.  These ideas make up the Quilt's pattern - they are the rules for how the rest of the game will proceed.  <br/><br/>A player pitches an idea by telling other players about it and seeking support.  Before a pitch is accepted the player proposing must spend 2 Power and convince 2 other players to spend 1 Power.  If any player objects, the idea is not accepted and everyone keeps their Power, but the turn continues clockwise.  If no one objects, the idea is added to the Pattern document.  <br/><br/>Ideas for the Pattern document can go from "We're using this extra page of Features" to "There is an ancient elven empire" to "We aren't going to swear while playing the game.  If you swear then you lose 1 Power." Usually, however, entries on the Pattern are major facts about the game world.<br/><br/>At any time, a player can ask for the game to start.  If no one objects then the game begins, otherwise making the Pattern continues.<br/><br/>While making the Pattern players should create their characters.  These are made by agreeing on starting Level and rolling stats.  Players should talk about how the characters are related to each other and to any parts of the Pattern.  Note that the Pattern trumps these rules - for example, if the Pattern says that there are no Dwarves in the game, there are no dwarves even though there are rules for dwarves in the Features section.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109216/#Comment_109216" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-21T17:07:23+00:00" title="November 21, 2007  5:07PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 21, 2007 11:08PM by Ry.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Game Starts</b><br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, players reach for a single die.

PCs get a point of Conviction for every scene they're present in.<br/> <br/><b>Power</b> is a Player resource, it helps buy Pattern and Patches.  Players get Power when they GM a scene (also see XP, below).  <br/>* <i>Pattern</i> is setting world parameters, like "There are no dwarves" or "Elves can have beards" or "The Dark Lord is alive and plots his return."<br/>* <i>Patches</i> are objects or master objects like "Kevris Kilraven, NPC thief" or "Goblin"<br/> <br/><b>XP</b> is another PC resource.  PCs get awarded a point of XP at the end of a scene when the GM thinks they've resolved a conflict where that PC was challenged (conflict including both combat, quest, etc.)  When a PC receives a point of XP they also receive a point of Power which they must give to another player (not themselves or the GM).

How inclusive do you plan on being?<br/><br/>Like, when I was pondering this the other night, it occurred to me that it might be really interesting to do something like, "Unless you have the Fighter Feature, you do face-to-face combat at -5." But, then also have stuff like, "If you have the Rogue Feature, you can attack without penalty as long as you sneak up on your opponent or do something underhanded." Or, "If you have Elf Feature, you can do combat with a longsword or bow unpenalized, otherwise it's -5." I'd be pretty enthused by such a prospect, especially if it was relatively easy to add a broad swath of Features as you go up in level.<br/><br/>But you might not want to be that restrictive about it - just food for thought, mostly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109421/#Comment_109421" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-23T18:10:07+00:00" title="November 23, 2007  6:10PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 23, 2007 6:19PM by Ry.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm seeing Classes and Races as packages of features, rather than individual ones, because I don't think they can deliver what they need to deliver (in terms of even loosely syncing up with d20 concepts) in just 1-2 sentences.<br/><br/>Edit: This was also because that way you can do character creation as "pick class, pick race, go!"  - I want a new player to walk in the door and be playing right away if the Pattern's established.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109426/#Comment_109426" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-23T20:24:30+00:00" title="November 23, 2007  8:24PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, the -5 to everything not part of a feature is appealing to me more and more.

They are skilled in the mobility and terrain control required of a soldier, including jumping, running, climbing, digging trenches, kicking down doors, and so on.  Fighters are natural in social situations involving hierarchy, either the explicit hierarchy of command or the implicit hierarchy of intimidation.<br/><br/><b>Grappler</b><br/>You get a +3 competence bonus when you try to grab another character in combat.  <br/><br/><br/>Here's the tricky bit:  Right now, what you've got are quick, easy rules.  The GM (i.e. the table) has broad discretion to interpret "grabbing another character" - there's no "you suffer an Attack of Opportunity on the way in" which would embroil us in the definition of Attack of Opportunity.  In this case, it's all up to the GM at the time whether it's reasonable to be able to grapple someone.  That means not importing feats directly - just importing what they imply.  I'm not sure which is better, but I know I don't want to be 5-foot-stepping across the battle or getting "bogged down" by the combat system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109771/#Comment_109771" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-27T05:06:57+00:00" title="November 27, 2007  5:06AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<big>Modifiers</big><br/><br/>These rolls are applied to the PC's roll, since all rolls are on the PCs' side.

I think I might be looking too much for Universalis-style equality when it's not what I want for the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried the collective worldbuilding and there were good elements there.  At the same time I think there's more juice to be had if I switch up the technique; we've gotten some dead air but partially that's just trying to drop the worry about stepping on each other, and that's going to be the same regardless of which all-equal method we use.  I'm starting to think that beyond genre assumptions maybe we should start with central (i.e. Player) characters and work outward from there.

Along with spells that restore vitality and turn plants into allies, they can converse with animals, and even call upon a wolf or other animal to aid them.<br/>\nFighters are skilled in combat with heavy armor and weaponry.<br/>\nMonks are spiritual unarmed combatants that use their focus and discipline to deliver powerful punches and kicks - some of which even leave the enemy dazed and unable to respond.<br/>\nPaladins are holy warriors, who can detect the presence of evil in their enemies and strike back against it. They are also initiate healers, capable of sending holy light from their hands to heal the wounds of the downtrodden. They are courageous, wearing heavy armor to defend against their foes and wielding mighty weaponry to strike back against them.<br/>\nRangers are skilled hunters that focus on a single hated foe. They are also woodsmen, able to follow spoor and tracks, and fight with either two weapons or a bow.<br/>\nThe [rogue] excels at performing acts of larceny. They can detect and disable traps or build traps of their own. In addition they can provide reconnaisance and they can deal additional damage by striking at an opponent's weak spot.<br/>\nSorcerers have the blood of dragons in their veins, and call upon this legacy to create magical effects. Sheets of flame, protection against the influence of fiends, and a grasp that zaps its recipient are all effects the sorcerer can manifest.<br/>\nWizards can read and detect magic, create magical light and sound, and move objects at a distance by concentrating. They can strike foes with magic missiles or shield themselves from harm.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez" title="Daniel_M_Perez"><img alt="Daniel_M_Perez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dmperez.com/offline/avatars/danny_avatar_03_32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez">Daniel_M_Perez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115667/#Comment_115667" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-20T14:15:01+00:00" title="December 20, 2007  2:15PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to say, I'm still a bit confused by the parts, probably because of the Unversalis influence in the game, since I've never seen the game, but the whole is starting to become clearer and I'm liking what I'm seeing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_115699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115699/#Comment_115699" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-20T17:36:02+00:00" title="December 20, 2007  5:36PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Give me till after Christmas: Instead of writing about what it's like and giving design snippets I'll try to write the rules of the game in the order they would be used in play.
