Anyways, It got me thinking: what would you do if you had a ton of money to put into a tabletop RPG? (Lets say a movie level budget, so millions of dollars here.)<br/>Do you think your game would be much better? The same? <br/>Do you think simply being able to work (with yourself or with others if you so chose) would drastically improve your game? <br/>Would you spend the money on advertising to make the game seen by the "mainstream" people? (we'll assume that you don't have to make the money back necessarily, perhaps you got some sort of huge inheritance that must be spent on making an RPG or something).<br/>Would you hire major artists, your own minis line or five, or whatever? <br/>Just a hypothetical here. I'd be interested to see what would happen if indie RPGs suddenly became "massively high budget with few restrictions" RPGs.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187506/#Comment_187506" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-10T23:56:40+00:00" title="January 10, 2009 11:56PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love to see what Luke Crane could do with millions of dollars.

Actually, I'd probably skip the design phase altogether and just bring in some excellent games and designers that have already been made. Some creative editing, professional copy-editing and new art, too. Whatever's left after that would go to innovative marketing towards new market segments. This would probably be the best choice for the rpg culture, and I believe that if I were told to specifically waste the money in this rpg project (as opposed to just spending a smart amount and keeping the rest), this'd probably be the best way to make some of it back as well. Spending it all on creating games would just result in more losses of the same type companies in the business suffer now.<br/><br/>Alternatively, use the money to finance indie operations. It'd take decades to run out, and in the long term it would replenish itself anyway.

For my current project, I'd get some of the city scenes from the artist <a href="http://tksn.web.infoseek.co.jp/" rel="nofollow">Imperial</a> <a href="http://tksn.web.infoseek.co.jp/notebook/notebook.htm" rel="nofollow">Boy</a>, who is likely rather expensive, given the amount of detail in each picture. I would accept using some pre-existing art, since it was what inspired the game.<br/><br/>The second place I could see spending the money is on sturdy binding. Every since I learned to do bookbinding by hand, I've come to appreciate good binding. Scratch that, ever since I had a game book fall apart on me I learned to appreciate good binding. Game books are reference works, meant to be opened and flipped through many, many times.

I would create a Gaming Club.  I would buy a decent building like a community center, move my HUGE gaming collection there, fill in the gaps with ancient games bought at auction by my minions, and supply the club with amazing furnishings catered to the geek lifestyle.<br/><br/>I would then supply membership grants to selected creators and gamers.  I would build a pod-casting wing with a decent studio and start a podcast released from there and nationally syndicated on AM talk radio (late nights).  I would then allow gamers to purchase memberships to the Club.<br/><br/>Then I sit back and assign my gaming Centurions to go out and build revenue and lore for the Club, report on their adventures on the podcast/radio show ("today we hear details of Magento43's expedition to China to discover additional details to make your Feng Shui games that much better!"). I will hop on the talk-show circuit and build the rep that comes with having an elite status in something.  All the while, I will sew the seed of the idea that somehow gaming is too hip for the masses (forcing the masses to want to do it to elevate themselves).<br/><br/>I would purchase a data-center for the Club and use it to serve sites and online services to aid in community building, resource collection, and online gaming for members and for prospective members.<br/><br/>Finally, I would make sure to have some revenue production through products, dues, and investments in the name of the Club to keep it self-sustaining.  Some of those funds would be reserved for scholarships and a annual Miss Gaming Pageant, the winner of which I will add to my harem of Gamer Grrls.<br/><br/><i><b>Ah, fantasy!</b></i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187564/#Comment_187564" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-11T09:43:56+00:00" title="January 11, 2009  9:43AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: efindel</cite>Well, I'll throw my hat in...<br/><br/>If I had a budget of millions for ...and cast no shadow, I'd go for full-color art, professional editing and layout, high quality paper, and all that.

I'd much rather see an adventure module style set up, with a minimum of pre-game fuss and muss, that has 10 pages about "Hacking this to make your own adventures" at the end of the text, almost as an afterthought, than the usual 100-500 page tome that gives you an advaenture as an afterthought.<br/><br/>Of course, I doubt such a thing would sell within the existing hobby market, which is why I suggested skipping that line of thinking entirely, and just giving the stuff away to increase the sales of something that does actually make fat money if successful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy" title="DeBracy"><img alt="DeBracy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nTIWP6SSS5BV3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy">DeBracy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187574/#Comment_187574" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-11T10:23:59+00:00" title="January 11, 2009 10:23AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 11, 2009 10:25AM by DeBracy.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Honestly, I find it interesting that most people would spend money on the physical product (art, binding, hardcovers, etc.).

But the challenge of trying to spend the money in a way that makes for a better game is an interesting one.<br/><br/>And y'know, I think there are problems that could be attacked with money.<br/><br/>One challenge facing traditional tabletop RPGs of the heavy setting variety is how to give prospective players enough knowledge of the setting that they're inspired and feel capable of playing, without having to issue them reading assignments.

Can you name any of their titles?  Do you know which one no longer exists?<br/><br/>(Both of those were founded by rich folks with a ton of money, but one of them is already gone.)</blockquote>\nI loved crossgen! I still have a signed Scion poster up on my wall. It's a shame they went under. Yeah, Radical is new and relatively unheard of, even in the comics world. I think their plan is to develop IPs that they'll make into movies or something. But yes, there are many similarities between the RPG and comic worlds. Anyways, I agree with people that you don't really need that much money to make an RPG, and it would almost certainly be better spent marketing or making some sort of foundation or hiring existing talent. But yeah, the idea of the original hypothetical was to see if or how a ton of money would help an RPG. It's very interesting to see all the different opinions though, from the people who would make golden books to the ones who don't need any money to keep on going.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades" title="guildofblades"><img alt="guildofblades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades">guildofblades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187878/#Comment_187878" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-12T16:37:02+00:00" title="January 12, 2009  4:37PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With a million dollars for an RPG project, I would:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Contract with a freelance IT consultant who specializes in EDI system to get me a simplified EDI system that I could use to sync into the EDI system at the major chains.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Hire a really talented artist full time.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Hire two programmers to begin working on the IT infrastructure for the game. Including a virtual table top that could link into the massive shared world environment that we would be supporting for the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Put the first few core rules and box sets into production and made ready for sale before the game was launched. Get some small dollar store editions of the core books made and set up meetings with the various dollar chains I would want to distribute them through.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Print a million fully playable introductory game books and distribute them through as many hobby game and comic stores as possibly and through every game con that would take them. Tie some rare support merchandise to a pre order program run through the local game stores. Free stuff would include small stuff like some free game books, t-shirts, but un all the way up to a small number of limited life sized statues of characters and critters from the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n6) Put together a paid event staff that would work part time organizing and running games at the highest profile retail stores around the nation. About 50 such people would be set up to work about 12-14 hours from friday evening through Sunday.<br/>\n<br/>\n7) Hire a staffer that would be dedicated to support logistics. Supporting printings and shipping and supporting the above mentioned demo and convention staff.<br/>\n<br/>\n8) Set up my own version of an OGL specific to the game and set up several different publisher participation packages meant to allow for small levels of envolvement like publishing modules or PDF support materials to larger projects involving development of full worlds and settings that would connect to and be a part of the larger online shared world setting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of that would run on a budget of about $750,000 for the first year. After that the game would have to start generatings its own operating capital and profits in order to be sustainable with that sort of structure. Un, yeah, I've put this plan to paper long before this thread. Just been waiting on the disposable $750K to get started. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan S.
