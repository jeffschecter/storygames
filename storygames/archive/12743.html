And I'm considering writing about it, but... <br/><br/>1. I maybe sort-of know the person behind the product, the way that a lot of us maybe sort-of know each other here. <br/>2. In the past, open criticism has had some surprising results; if I don't reeeeally sweeten the pill, people can send some surprisingly angry whispers.<br/><br/>Of course, we never reach a consensus on this issue. (I'm not even sure this community (or whatever it is) CAN reach a consensus; maybe we lack the tools or structure). So if I go out and post criticism of a product, it's a personal risk. I'm essentially taking a chance on weakening the maybe sort-of friendship I have with whoever's behind the product. <br/><br/>Right now, on Story Games, criticism of each others' products is Simply Not Done. Competitions and conventions, sure, but not products. <br/><br/>Good thing or bad thing?

The writer himself wasn't upset about what I wrote, but some of his friends were livid because I'd broken this unspoken code of conduct.<br/><br/>Moving forward I had to decide whether to review any crime writer's work, review such work only kindly, or be very careful about the language I use.  And by language I don't mean profanity, but the level of criticality I level at the work in question.  In the end I decided to just let it go because there are too many pitfalls.  No matter how careful I am with my criticism, somebody somewhere is going to take offense and I just can't be bothered with that kind of drama.<br/><br/>It sucks not to be able to be honest about something you're read that you really feel needs criticism, particularly of the constructive variety, but sometimes we have to do things to keep the peace.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286500/#Comment_286500" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-15T14:27:56+00:00" title="August 15, 2010  2:27PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Double King</cite>however, if you chose to brave the waters, it looks like there are some others (above,) plus myself, that would welcome your constructive and honest feedback about games.</blockquote>\nDefinitely.

That's really the core of a public critique, right there: it is you telling an audience what you think.  If what you think is "This is awful," <i>and you want people to know that</i>, you post your criticism and take whatever reaction you get from it.  It's your opinion and you get to choose how you state it, but you're arguably a better and more decent person if you try to be polite.  That may not keep your criticism from hurting anyone's feelings, but at least you didn't set out to offend them.<br/><br/>* Is it because you think your criticism will be useful to the author?  Then you should probably just send it to the author directly, and not bother with making it public.<br/><br/>* Is it because you're not sure if you're right and need to talk it over with other people?  Then you'll probably get more mileage and a less-obstreperous discussion out of posting questions rather than a criticism:  "I don't understand how this combat system works, it seems awkward and prone to producing bad results -- am I getting it wrong, what do you guys think?" instead of "This combat system is awkward and poorly designed."

Check this out.\n<blockquote><b>COLD CITY</b><br>some brief criticism by Jonathan<br><br>Malcolm is one of the coolest people I have ever met.  Just to get that out there.  He's also writing his MA thesis on WWII stuff in New Zealand, so he's a badass.<br/><br/>Malcolm came to GenCon with A|State one year, the same year that The Mountain Witch broke big, and apparently went back to the UK with his head buzzing about what The Forge-based indie scene was up to. Cold City came out the next year and its indebtedness to the Mountain Witch was obvious from the beginning.  Basically, it's a Mountain Witch hack more than a real stand-along game, in many respects.  And the places where it drifts away from the Mountain Witch are perhaps where it is weakest.  Statting up monsters differently from each other -- rather than having three different kinds of challenges ala TMW -- pushes the game in the direction of being a traditional dungeon-y monster-fighter, especially when combined with the locales suggested in the game, which grinds awkwardly against the premise and color.  Also, the addition of positive/negative traits, potentially a clever idea (drawing, I suspect on the idea of TSOY Keys and fallout from Dogs), plays havoc with the reward systems and other things.  Agendas come off as an interesting attempt to build on Dark Fates and are perhaps the most successful of his extensions.  However, Cold City views itself as a longer running game than the Mountain Witch, perhaps contributing to the problem by making things less focused (both situationally and mechanically) in general.<br/><br/>That said, the book is beautifully written and evocative and the overall concept is compelling.  Playing it can often be successful, but it often feels like the rules are inconsistent in helping you achieve awesomeness.  Some things have been fixed in the more recent revision, which is even more evocative and beautiful as a written and illustrated product, but perhaps don't go far enough in resolving underlying mechanical issues with the game.  Likewise, the "sequel" to Cold City, Hot War, is somewhat more focused, but I haven't played it and don't feel confident in asserting whether or not it has transcended some of the issues with Cold City.  It is even more evocative and beautifully written than Cold City Revised, though.  So Malcolm continues to push that bar forward, at least.<br/><br/>Cold City is significant because it marks -- along with Best Friends, Mob Justice, and Contenders -- one of the first attempts by the Forge indie scene to connect with indie tabletop communities outside the US and Canada, presaging the connections that would eventually develop with Japanese and especially Nordic designers.  Also, design-wise it marked the first real use of CG illustrations in a Forge-style game (A|State was written pre-Forge-contact) and melded some of the White Wolf school of game book design (background textures, fake documents, messy typography, evocative fiction) with the dimensions and small page count common with Forge-influenced indie games.  It was also, though this is more controversial and subjective, part of a post-2005 wave of new games that were brought to publication with the expectation of following the success of The Mountain Witch, Polaris, and Dogs in the Vineyard, but quickly found themselves aswim in a flood of new games, many of which were inconsistently awesome at the table.  This began a round of introspection and self-examination on the forums and blogs, talks about "quality" and "criticism."  As such, many of the games of this era are unfairly lumped together and receive less overall attention than those published before and after.<br/><br/>Malcolm would go on to be a significant figure in the UK indie scene, partially through being one of main faces of the Collective Endeavor. He has been significantly less active in recent years since the publication of Hot War, since he's moved to New Zealand. Paul Bourne continues to be an active illustrator and designer for indie games, especially ones from the UK.</br></br></br></blockquote>\nSo... not a ringing endorsement, but places the game in context, explains why it's important, and finds the value and significance if the overall community.<br/><br/>EDIT: In a perfect world, this would contain more about the game itself and how it works, plus be fact-checked and experience-checked with a bunch of other knowledgeable people, including Malcolm himself, before being posted or published somewhere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286539/#Comment_286539" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-15T16:19:20+00:00" title="August 15, 2010  4:19PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 15, 2010 4:19PM by Elizabeth.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, I can see where that would be useful to people who aren't me, Jonathan. But like, saying "This is like TMW and the places where it doesn't work are places where it's not like TMW" is essentially meaningless to me, because I've never played or read TMW. I'm also not a huge "history" buff (where history = the last 5 years?).  I would rather see a critique of the game that goes into detail about its mechanics, its writing, its use as a reference document and its use as a teaching tool, and how it worked at the table\u2014 along with constructive ideas for how to ameliorate the problems the book might have and an honest assessment of whether the book's worth money.<br/><br/>Thing is, I'm selective about what I buy, and I don't buy games for their historical significance. I <i>might</i> play a game for its historical significance, but probably not unless there were other reasons I was interested in playing it as well. I think a bio of Malcolm is useful for people who want to know who he is, but I don't think that a discussion of a game requires the author's credentials. You don't need to know that the author who wrote Apocalypse World is the author of Dogs, you just need to know that the game is amazing and why.<br/><br/>Edit: crossposted with Jonathan's edit, but I think it still stands.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286540/#Comment_286540" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-15T16:24:33+00:00" title="August 15, 2010  4:24PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite>Danielle taught me that I need none of it.

Putting something on the wall for people to judge is terrifying, so if it was clear that someone had put effort into a particular work then it absolutely was not okay to say "this is shite". <br/><br/>FIRST you find at least one thing, preferably a couple of things that you admire and provide more than trivial detail. What is it that you like and why? ("I like the choices of color and the sense of energy. The brushstrokes really give a sense of movement.")<br/><br/>THEN you bring up things you find problematic that you can see concrete solutions to. ("The composition is problematic. Because only a tiny part of their arm is cut off it looked like it happened on accident. I would re-crop the image so that it's clear that the framing is deliberate.")<br/><br/>LAST you bring up things that you find problematic that you can't see an immediate solution to, admitting that you may be speaking to a personal bias and leaving it an open question. If it is a valid criticism, someone else can probably put their finger on what is bothering you. If no one else agrees, its probably a bias. ("I get why you chose to finish your piece this way, but I think it might be detracting from the message. I'm not sure that I can see an easy solution, though. Does anyone else have an idea, or is this just me not liking grungy pieces again?")<br/><br/>This is important because:<br/>A) Providing positive feedback first indicates that you're trying to help the creator improve their art<br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> Providing positive feedback first means that it doesn't get ignored. Positive feedback is just as important as negative feedback when you've been working on something for two weeks straight with four hours of sleep a night and you are convinced it is THE WORST THING EVER.<br/>C) Pointing out problems paired with solutions is way, way, way more helpful than just pointing out problems. If you point out a problem and don't offer a solution, I have no idea if you're right or if you're talking out your ass. Offering solutions will let me evaluate where you're coming from and help me to see my art in a new way.<br/>D) When you point out a problem that you don't see a solution to, admitting bias can be painful but it is neccessary. Sometimes the answer will be 'yes, your bias is talking right now'. More often you will help someone else articulate something that will lead to a solution.<br/><br/><br/>I would really love to see a lot more game criticism framed this way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286554/#Comment_286554" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-15T18:50:30+00:00" title="August 15, 2010  6:50PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 15, 2010 6:53PM by Will_Hindmarch.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know.

Part of why I posted that was for us to have something concrete to talk about.  The example above was addressing the "why should I care about this game / what's significant about this game?" issue but not the "should I buy this game?" issue or the "I'm about to try out this game tonight, is there anything special I should know about it?" issue.  Different people want different things out of criticism, so I definitely get why you might not be interested in the review above where I definitely would.<br/><br/>In my mind, I guess I don't really know how to answer "should I buy this game?" for someone else.  Like, people buy games for all sorts of reasons, often for reasons other than playing them, so I think I'd need more specific criteria for that.  I DO think that a good critique / review could potentially review both the critiquer's own play experiences and those of others and try to summarize any significant "findings" or whatever.  There's also extensive room for people to talk about "how does this game play / what is the experience it offers?" especially if they've played a game extensively, and I think that could be really cool too.<br/><br/><b>Paul:</b> That's a very cool approach too.  Really, you'd hope that all criticism could be offered with love.  I wonder if taking the "how could this game be the best it could be?" approach to reviewing could be sustainable over a bunch of reviews.  I tried to do that initially with my Murderland reviews but I think they got weaker over time as I got more and more tired and less and less able to commit myself to each subsequent review.  Loving something unfinished and imperfect (frex: people) can be really taxing at times.

So, in that spirit, how's <i>this</i> for sharp critique?<br><br>Let's break down why this Cold City critique is bad.<br>\n<blockquote>Malcolm came to GenCon with A|State one year, the same year that The Mountain Witch broke big, and apparently went back to the UK with his head buzzing about what The Forge-based indie scene was up to. Cold City came out the next year and its indebtedness to the Mountain Witch was obvious from the beginning.  Basically, it's a Mountain Witch hack more than a real stand-along game, in many respects.  And the places where it drifts away from the Mountain Witch are perhaps where it is weakest.</blockquote>\nThis is awful, I mean really really bad.  First, it theorizes about how he got the idea. Here's a concept, if you want to start your review with how Malcolm got his idea, why not just e-mail this guy and ask him how he got the idea and write that down. I question the utility of telling us how he got the idea in the first place, what if he fucked up the idea, or what if he did something really amazing but didn't accomplish what he wanted? <br><br>But okay, maybe there might be some information in how he got the idea that I could use, but just "he got the idea from Mountain Witch", even if he did, tells me nothing about the idea, it doesn't tell me what the idea actually is. Does Mountain Witch only contain one idea? I can't imagine any kind of human text that could only produce one idea, in all kinds of different people reading it in all kinds of different contexts.  Then it says the place where it drifts away from this idea is where it's weakest. So it's extremely relevant to tell me what the idea of TMW is, and this critique - spoiler alert! - never does.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Walton</cite>Statting up monsters differently from each other -- rather than having three different kinds of challenges ala TMW -- pushes the game in the direction of being a traditional dungeon-y monster-fighter, especially when combined with the locales suggested in the game, which grinds awkwardly against the premise and color.  Also, the addition of positive/negative traits, potentially a clever idea (drawing, I suspect on the idea of TSOY Keys and fallout from Dogs), plays havoc with the reward systems and other things.  Agendas come off as an interesting attempt to build on Dark Fates and are perhaps the most successful of his extensions.  However, Cold City views itself as a longer running game than the Mountain Witch, perhaps contributing to the problem by making things less focused (both situationally and mechanically) in general.</blockquote>\nAnd this just compounds the insanity! Here we are talking about: monster stats, locales, positive and negative traits, agendas, a reward system, and assumptions about game length. OH MY GOD, what the fuck is this whole paragraph even talking about?!<br><br>Here's what a critique (for example) of the monster stat system should contain:<br><br/>"Here's how Cold City does monster stats."<br/>("This is different from TMW in  way X." -- optional, but it would be nice to pursue that "the areas not like TMW sucked" thesis)<br/>"This creates muddled results in play by this mechanism."<br/><br/>Similarly with all those elements. If I can't read your critique and know exactly what you're talking about, maybe I come away thinking that TMW has a Strength stat for monsters (or whatever) and Cold City doesn't, and you think Strength stats are needed because arm wrestling contests are a big deal in the game. <br/><br/>But even if you don't intend this critique for an audience as ignorant as me, let's say I happen to have TMW and Cold City sitting right in front of me when I read this critique, and I love your critique so much that I stop, go and re-read the two texts, and return to it, refreshed and remembering exactly how the two are different.  (By the way, nobody in any audience will ever love what you're writing that much.)  The only thing your critique says about the monster stat process is that it "pushes the game in the direction of being a traditional dungeon-y monster-fighter, especially when combined with the locales suggested in the game" and this is bad because it "grinds awkwardly against the premise and color."  THIS IS NOT A CRITIQUE. You didn't tell me anything about how the system conflicts conflicts with the premise or how the system pushes the game in that direction, or why the conflict between system and premise is bad, or significant, or whatever you're saying it is.<br/><br/>The same is true for all the other bits and pieces here. Why is being unfocused bad? Why is assuming a long game bad? What in  Cold City made you decide these two things were how it was intended?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Walton</cite>That said, the book is beautifully written and evocative and the overall concept is compelling.</blockquote>\nFUCK!! What is this CONCEPT?! Okay, so maybe I'm supposed to already know what the concept is.  Assume I do, but I'm reading your critique anyway, so I want to know: Why is it compelling? What about it is compelling? Who will find it compelling? Why did you personally find it compelling?

So it is no wonder criticism is dependent on some intellectual distance, a certain refinement of thought, amongst those reading it, to work well. Most people on the net do not have this refinement of thought, so they will react badly to criticism, even on behalf of others.<br/><br/>There is no way avoiding the hotheads on an open forum. The only solution is to ignore the hotheads (they're only spoiling for a fight), and focus solely on reflected and constructive answers to your criticism (or the constructive parts of the answers, ignoring the rantings often mingled into them). It's an exercise in tranquility, patience, objectivity and directed effort. This goes for anything you post on an open forum, actually.<br/><br/>The point of criticism is, of course, to provoke intellectual and/or creative developments, either in the author at hand or in those coming after him/her.

As a stance without this ability, your "economy of awareness" got a dark shadow to it; the people criticizing something will be labeled "troublemakers". They will be shouted down, and their critique will be ignored.<br><br>So; I do agree with you; in the economy of awareness ignoring something is the biggest thumbs down. If you ignore necessary criticism, however, you will probably make it go away, and be worse off for it. ;-)<br><br>In my world of gaming and design (a sadly imperfect one), the necessity of critique is quite obvious; by discussing faulty design we all have a chance of learning something. By setting words to <i>how this game don't work for us</i>, we may instigate a tweaking of the method, and make it work. Or we may agree to set it aside, and pick up another one (a great step in many gaming groups). Discussions on a game on the net, may inform the discussions of a gaming-group, and help them make a good choice in this circumstance. Discussions on a game may also help the designer see both faults and strengths of his design, and make him better equipped to go one step beyond in his next game ...<br/><br/>For after all; games lifting us all up to the multicolored sky of imaginative interaction, is much better than games dragging us down into the pitfalls of bored and repetitive illusions of fun!                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286598/#Comment_286598" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T02:36:35+00:00" title="August 16, 2010  2:36AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So what I'm taking away right now is this: Why do I want to critique and/or criticize? <br/><br/>- In many cases (for instance in game reviews), it's because I like the product, but it's got some heartbreaking (in my opinion) flaws. I just want it to be perfect, and the faults are fairly easy to remedy. This is really only useful for the creator if they intend to make more/new versions. (It was also the reason I moaned about the lack of editors for a couple of years there - "I wish I'd seen this before it came out, so I could have told them what to do".)<br/><br/>- Sometimes I just want to vent: "Couldn't they just have done the OBVIOUSLY RIGHT THING so that this product could have turned out WAY BETTER?" That probably doesn't help anyone, so I keep it for conversations with friends.<br/><br/>- In some cases (for instance in actual play), it's to point out to others what the potential stumbling blocks are: "This didn't work for me/my style/approach because..."

The factual errors are very minor. Malcolm's Masters Thesis was on the Korean War and the non-use of nuclear weapons in that conflict (Malcolm's PhD that he's undertaking at Edinburgh University is on the cold war, nuclear weapons and racism) and Cold City (owing perhaps to the success of a|state, the grabbiness of "monster hunting in 1950's Berlin", the presentation of the book, and the quality of the writing) got markedly more interest and sales than many of the other games in that "wave" of 2006. It's had over 1500 sales and is now in distro through Cubicle 7 so anyone talking about the game is a good thing (I'm sure Malcolm's heard a load of praise and criticism about it in the last 4 years).<br/><br/>The other thing is that I can nod along with Jonathan's critique yet disagree about his views in places. That's OK. I can form my own views while taking Jonathan's words into consideration. I can't do that if I don't know what Jonathan's POV is.<br/><br/>Anyway, up thread Mathijs says the mystery game is "pretty okay, but definitely not very good." That's not bad is it? What's so fearful about someone saying a book is "pretty okay". Sure, we'd all like all our games to be "very good" but I'd like to know where Mathijs feels it's "pretty okay" but not very much better than that. Maybe Mathijs is wrong from how I see it, or maybe I agree with him? Maybe I think he's being too kind? We can at least then make our own minds up if we talk about it and discuss specifics.<br/><br/>I have a very low opinion of people calling for a code of silence on games or asking that we all be cheerleaders for each others games. It's counter productive and dishonest.<br/><br/>If you don't care for a game then I'm not saying you should talk about it, but if you have something to say on a game you care about you should say it. Especially if the feedback helps improve the game and future designs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_286602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286602/#Comment_286602" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T03:34:58+00:00" title="August 16, 2010  3:34AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I totally agree with Gregor; a code of silence is not constructive.

I'm just saying it's risky being the guy criticizing games in public, and it's uncomfortable when people take it personally and get angry.</blockquote>\nAre we really talking about being concerned about being personally identified on the Internet?<br/><br/>Matthijs, if you want to present your opinions about a specific game to ensure that the general game-buying audience is aware of both its strengths and its flaws before they make a purchasing decision, but you're worried about personal backlash, make an account on rpg.net using a fictional identity and write up a thoughtful, in-depth, critical review. If you're concerned about affecting your friend's sales numbers, Tyler is totally right - for a game <i>not</i> have any Internet commentary is worse than it having one critical review. If anything you're helping your friend make the game better in future revisions, or improving subsequent design efforts.<br/><br/>The only reason this approach would fail is if you're hoping to use your own notoriety as an Internet persona to give weight to your arguments, but good arguments ought to stand on their own.<br/><br/>But yeah, if you're just trying to help your friend be a better designer, talk to them privately instead. Paul Czege has a good point; a good designer will be the harshest critic of their work, and the best service you could provide is enthusiastic and productive feedback that presents concrete solutions to issues you've perceived, ideally in the context of actual play experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286655/#Comment_286655" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T07:36:18+00:00" title="August 16, 2010  7:36AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 16, 2010 7:36AM by jenskot.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've written reviews and been told I was too brutal and other times way too nice. I've even been told I'm way too open minded and flexible to write customer reviews right after being told I expect too much! <br/><br/>You can't win if winning is pleasing everyone!<br/><br/>JDCorley is right in that "1,000,000 people on the Internet already hate you and everything you think, just by the law of large numbers, you just don't happen to know them." And criticism is also open to criticism!<br/><br/>When I critique, I try to be extremely honest with myself. Why am I doing this? Why am I saying it the way I'm saying it? Why am I saying it where I'm saying it? <br/><br/>Too many people try to pass venting or marketing as reviews. Other people are just trying to help but do so in a manner than hurts people when there are alternatives. Be honest and critical of yourself and you'll find the best way to criticize or simply choose not to. Be transparent. If something else is going on, say so. I've written glowing praise of friend's work not thinking that being friends obviously biases me. But it does. Be open so we are all on the same page and can get the most out of our communications. <br/><br/>If I know a designer and think they could do something to improve their work, then why would I post it publicly? Seriously? To embarrass them? Pressure them? If I know them, why wouldn't I just talk to them. <br/><br/>If I'm pissed off and venting, why would I write a customer review and try to pass myself off as even and fair? That's uncool. I love customer reviews, they are some of the best parts of the internet. But I can't assess your review if you aren't being honest. Know the people you are reviewing? Say so. Hate the people you are reviewing? Say so. <br/><br/>If you want to write a customer review (and I would love if more people write reviews), why post it on a forum that doesn't feature reviews and where the designer likes to hang out. Why not post it to the review sections of RPG.net?<br/><br/>Be honest and accept your critique will be critiqued.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

"Criticism is hard," is what ConceptArt.Org told my brother in a recent expo in Berlin.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy brother has had discussions with some pretty influential people around the world on the topic of art critique for education. The problem, he tells me, is that people don't critique for the right reason. People critique for themselves, not for the artist. They want to demonstrate their power, perception and intelligence. This is totally unhelpful for an artist in training. If you look at a life drawing, you should try to indicate to the artist what he has done well. Don't tell the artist that the proportions are all wrong, tell them that their lines are good, or their rendering is good, and so on. As long as it is positive <i>and</i> honest, you can say it. A good artist knows his proportions are all wrong. Your job is to give him the confidence to continue to practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, it is important, in addition to the cultivation of confidence, to train the eye. The easiest solution is to tell the artist he's shit. Or his lines are shit. Or his composition is shit. But it's also totally destructive. Instead, you might encourage the artist to ask questions. "What could you have done to improve your line?" The trick is in directing the artist toward his weaknesses without direct criticism, not because you think he's a pussy, but because you want to build a pattern of detection and repair so that, in the future, he doesn't need you to tell him he's shit any more.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe difficulty here is in directing a student to self criticism. It's much easier to do if you loads the student with tools before you get to that point of critique. For example, if you know that judging proportions in life drawing is easier if you are more aware of 'negative space,' then you should teach the student about negative space before you ask him to look for it when his proportions are wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe important thing is to encourage, reward and expose the assets and at the same time endorse a self critical eye. I think it sounds like a successful model for art education and maybe it will work as well for indie game critique.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286660/#Comment_286660" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T07:54:27+00:00" title="August 16, 2010  7:54AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 16, 2010 8:24AM by PaulCzege.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think critical reviews are necessary journalism for consumers in the face of an industry. But Story Games and The Forge aren't a profit- and sales-maximizing industry. And Matthijs is talking about posting criticism into the context of Story Games.<br><br>Yes, the community has had public cries of pain and calls for more rigorous criticism -- most notably post Gen Con 2006. But it is clear from the passage of time that neither of the two games commonly offered up from 2006 as justification for more rigorous criticism was willfully pushed forth as a profit- and sales-maximizing cash grab. Both of them were in fact, as evidenced by subsequent releases of carefully revised editions, creative projects from within an artistic community that didn't get needed feedback before being naively published.<br><br>What the community needs is great games by inspired designers, not a culture of rigorous criticism to defend its market of consumers from mercenary pseudo-artists.

Putting something on the wall for people to judge is terrifying, so if it was clear that someone had put effort into a particular work then it absolutely was not okay to say "this is shite".</blockquote>\nAgreed. Also coming from the art school background, I support this view of Critique (very important to frame it in that term, criticism is something else entirely) for all creative mediums in order to help the artists learn and grow. I want to get as much feedback on my work as possible, because other people can see things I can't, and that perspective is incredibly valuable in order for me to improve. And improvement will always be happening.<br><br>Personally, I think people want to hear critique about their work. With finished pieces, you have to frame it in a "moving forward with these ideas" way, so with a game, you can say "well, maybe with your next game, you can try and get over this obvious hiccup in pacing" or "y'know, i really appreciate how much effort you put into the length of this book, but man, maybe have an editor go over it again for grammar next time." Most likely, any big glaring errors the artist/author is already aware of, so if you're just re-hashing that, the best part of the critique you can offer then is how to fix it for next time, or how to create an errata to help fix it. Solutions are key.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_286668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286668/#Comment_286668" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T08:12:04+00:00" title="August 16, 2010  8:12AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 16, 2010 8:24AM by TomasHVM.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sebastian: it may be that you confuse criticism with pedagogy ... ;-)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite>What the community needs is great games by inspired designers, not a culture of rigorous criticism ...</blockquote>Eh ... may we criticize without rigor? What about vigorous criticism? The question is how such a forum is conductive to us growing as designers. I suspect the answer is manifold; critique, praise, connections, insights, ideas, the whole discourse ...<br/><br/>- Some of us takes the stance that all should praise one another, and our games, all the time, or be silent.<br/><br/>- Some of us (me included) talks about the importance of setting words to, not only strengths in design, but also the flaws.<br/><br/>I get the feeling that the first stance is a social one, not a stance about how we support the design-endeavors of each other. I suspect it to be a stance taken on the basis of being tired of battling it out in forums like this one, whatever the theme is. It is a valid stance, in my view, on the personal level; you may shy away from the heated debates on the net as much as you want. When we talk about what guidelines a forum like this should follow, however, I believe it imperative for the usefulness of it that critique is allowed, even encouraged. The conflicts arising from it must be tolerated. The illusion of a society in eternal peace (on the net or elsewhere) can not set precedence here. No happiness will ensue from PRAISE as a totalitarian principle. ;-)<br/><br/>So to me, the idea of talking both of good and bad things, in design, is a more balanced stance.<br/><br/>To point out the flaws in a design, is to invite conflict, of course. Some conflicts are unavoidable. Keep your calm, ask your questions, and let conflict ensue if your opponents want it. They may resent the unavoidable answers, and the arrival of a new truth may be hard to handle. So they get in conflict, with you or themselves, or both; thy get into <i>the conflict of change</i>.<br/><br/>Or they may disagree with you, and have good arguments to back it up. Maybe it is your turn to get into it ...<br/><br/>My main point is this: <b>Conflict may be positive!</b> It may all be about people growing and understanding. Try to keep that in mind. <i>Respect </i>is not shown by pampering the small ego of a man, but to talk in earnest with his greater soul.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286669/#Comment_286669" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T08:17:47+00:00" title="August 16, 2010  8:17AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to read critiques of other games. It's a good way to learn about them. When a critic says "it's stupid because it's doing X" I might very well read that and say "oh shit, i love it when a game does X!, this guy's an idiot, BUY NOW."<br/><br/>There are no products (especially self published indie games) that are devoid of flaws, often big ones. Our best work as a community could probably use a lot of improvement. That doesn't make them intrinsically bad, it just means we're still working on all of it. Hearing critiques help not just the designer of the game being discussed, but other folks who are designing games, and people playing them. Learning that your group didn't understand a particular element might keep me from putting that element in a game, or might make me want to try that out in my play group, see what we can make of it. <br/><br/>Don't be mean? Do we even need to say this? I guess we do, but i hate institutionalized "don't be a dick" rules. They're patronizing. You should always be not a dick, like at work, or on the internet, or on the bus. These are the basics.<br/><br/>I think, as a creator, there is no greater insult to a work than people NOT talking about it.

In the latter case, I think it should always be constructive, and therefore educational. So that is where the mix-up occurs.<br/>\n<br/>\nHonesty in criticism is essential. But it is neither essential nor useful, in my understanding, to destroy. That is, I think that when I criticise an artist, it is my responsibility to ensure that he gains from the criticism, not me. However, when I criticise my reaction to a piece of art, I am no longer tied to that law. That is, if I say that I am confused by a text, that I am disturbed by an idea, that I am enthused by a mechanic, I am no longer required to instruct. There's the important difference, for me, between dialogue and reverie.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_286674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286674/#Comment_286674" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T08:30:26+00:00" title="August 16, 2010  8:30AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matthijs: you are a very social person, with a lot of friends and connections.

But Story Games and The Forge aren't a profit- and sales-maximizing industry. And Matthijs is talking about posting criticism into the context of Story Games.</blockquote>\nI agree with you Paul, but I still think consumers benefit from critical play-oriented reviews, to identify hidden gems as well as to uncover flaws.  There's more interesting stuff out there than anybody has the time and money to investigate (and time is scarcer than money for me these days).  <br/><br/>On the other hand, "critical reviews" in the sense of literary criticism don't seem useful to anybody but future grad students who will crib from them when writing their theses about indie gaming.  (EDIT: Maybe I worded this too harshly, I find these things really interesting to read but I'm not sure they actually help people play or write better games.)<br/><br/>But Matthijs, I think the real issue you bring up is social, that you don't feel comfortable giving negative reviews to games by people you like and have to get along with in the crowded little world of indie gaming.  That's a real problem without an easy solution, but here are some things that have worked in similar situations in the writing world:\n<ul>\n<li>Only write reviews of games that you honestly feel comfortable praising.  Smile noncommitally when your buddy asks you to review his turkey.  <br/><br/></li><li>Create a web-based review journal with some likeminded folks where you review games <i>ruthlessly </i>and <i>pseudonymously</i>.  Be sure to criticize one of your own games as well.  Realize that you will still get static for being associated in any way with this journal. <br/><br/></li><li>Review games under your own name, call 'em as you see 'em, and resign yourself to being resented and talked about behind your back.  This is just human behavior, and I've seen it happen in medical journals and in boy scout troops.  There's no escaping it.<br/><br/></li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286812/#Comment_286812" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T13:59:27+00:00" title="August 16, 2010  1:59PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DannyK</cite>On the other hand, "critical reviews" in the sense of literary criticism don't seem useful to anybody but future grad students who will crib from them when writing their theses about indie gaming.</blockquote>\nI don't know, man.

Write about the cool or interesting things that happened in the game due to following its rules and procedures. And write about the weird or confusing things that happened due to following its rules and procedures. Write about the things that you weren't able to bring into the game because you couldn't understand them.<br/><br/>Ideally, it will lead to a dialogue with the creator. You may even find that the things that you thought were weird or confusing were completely intentional. Or maybe they weren't. Regardless, it should lead to an honest discussion. And giving the creator enough respect to actually play the game before ripping it to shreds should go a long way toward preventing hard feelings.<br/><br/>It's worked in the past.
