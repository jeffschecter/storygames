                    Over on another board, folks were discussing the benefit of God-GM play, and we got a little side-tracked (my fault!) on the question of whether central authority was a more workable social contract than others with more distributed authority.  Max, quite reasonably, pointed out that he'd been in a lot of GM-less games that didn't work out too well.  I have too!  Is that just an accident?  Nah.  But, by that point, it was totally clear that I was off on a tanget, so I took it to PM with him, and he liked the PM so much that he recommended I repost it here, and people could discuss it more broadly.  So, here it is!  My fault, all mine, all the time, fault.  Don't blame Max.  He'd be sad.
<blockquote><cite>Balbinus wrote:</cite>That said, my actual play experience (admittedly in con games which may be very relevant) is that it tends to still veer over time into gonzo, now that may just be poor luck on my part but it makes me less keen on shared authorial powers.</blockquote>No, it probably isn't bad luck.  Central authority is <i>by far</i> the most robust system when (as a system) it's built slightly wrong.  It's like the Kalishnikov of the social contract world ... abuse it all you want, it's still probably going to work just fine.  So if you're building house rules, and you use a central-authority system, you can probably screw up ten or fifteen other things, and never notice that they're screwed up.<br/><br/>All of the systems that I've seen that make shared authority work are trickier than that.  They can still work, and they can take a pounding, but only if they're built <b>right</b>.<br/><br/>By contrast (and I may be reading too much into your experience, in which case please do rein me back in) I have seen a fair number of shared authority systems that people built <b>wrong</b> and never tested ... <i>particularly</i> at convention games.<br/><br/>A budding designer says to himself "Everyone should play the way my happy group at home plays, with shared authority and all that jazz, so I'll run a convention session that plays that way!" and so they make a system which is <i>in all ways</i> like a GM-central system, only they rip out the GM.<br/><br/>It's like saying "Freon is bad for the environment, so let's make a refrigerator with no cooling system of any kind!  It'll rock!"  Predictably enough, if you pull out the freon without figuring out what's going to take its place you end up with a refrigerator that performs very poorly.<br/><br/>So I'm totally on board with your experience.  The fact that I know that GM-less systems <b>can</b> be built to work does not even begin to imply that any random GM-less system <b>will</b> work.                </div>

                            That makes sense to me.  A central authority figure will always be easier to work with and predict than a group of people exercising distributed authority, barring other factors such as a group that plays together particularly well.                        </div>

                            Yes Tony, since I'm trying to build such a game, I'd love to hear your insights from the trenches. How do you approach the problem - it seems much more than just figuring out what the central authority would normally do and assigning those roles to particular players or all of them. <br/><br/>This also seems to dovetail nicely with the partake vs. create gamer distinction being discussed in another thread - do you think that a distributed authority game can work with a group of players who prefer to partake? What can such a game do to encourage/enable a broad variety of gamers to use the tools it provides to get play that isn't always silly or over the top?                        </div>

</div></blockquote>
<p>I have two thoughts on this.</p>
<p>First, people who partake don't do so <em>in exclusion to</em> creating. They just don't care about creating and will be turned off by products that emphasize creating or enforce creating. So, if you distribute authority without requiring requiring creativity, you should be OK, with the proviso that partakers are mainly afraid of anything that inhibits the partaking experience. In other words, they don't want someone in their group to go out of control and start creating stuff that isn't part of the experience they bought into in the first place. "No Buffy in my Star Trek, dammit!"</p>
<p>Second, a game without central authority is not necessarily a game with distributed authority, if you're limiting "central authority" to mean central <em>human</em> authority over what gets created. You can assign "creativity" to a process, like rolling on a result table or letting a book fall open at random, and let the players elaborate the resuts as they see fit.</p>
<p>I think you can implement this with a combination of <em>Donjon</em>-style skill use (searching for a secret door creates one) and a rule similar to "say yes or roll the dice": create, or roll the dice. Most of the details deal with how to protect a group of protectors from a "rogue creator".</p>
<p>I'm predicting that some groups organized on these principles will fall into a pattern resembling central authority, but it's more of a first-among-equals situation, where the additions of one person become respected, so that person creates more and more of the fictional material and the other players fall back to merely elaborating... but because the authority is "officially" distributed, the balance can shift at any time.</p>

                            I think the gonzo/silly/over the top is a reaction to being freed from a central authority. The first few times you play Once Upon A Time you see the same thing. People can't quite believe that everyone really means that they can do anything, so they push the envelope in various directions.<br/><br/>Another direction I've seen is sexual double (and single) entendre.<br/><br/>I think if you're removing a central authority, there just isn't a good way to avoid this issue until everyone has their feet firmly on the ground with what they can and can't do.  The tools would be collaboration tools, to decide on limitations for content. Here I am thinking of the Comics Code in Capes! and the series pitch (or even a series bible) in Primetime Adventures. If someone agrees to a Comics Code in Capes! that includes a serious or even grim tone, they're simply breaking a rule if they go over the top.<br/><br/>Even these are fairly ad hoc tools, though, it is true...                        </div>

In that way, you have some collaboration and some less central authority, without going "100% GM free gonzo roleplay" right off the bat.<br/><br/>Another game that explores this similar thing is Polaris, where at any given time there is one player, and three GMs, each with a different kind of power and role.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Talk more about building right, Tony.</blockquote>Uh ... 'kay.<br/><br/>I think of a lot of things (particularly in this type of game-design) as being cycles of feedback.  Some cycles are positive:  the more something happens, the more it will happen in future.  Like sticking an electric guitar in front of the speaker it's plugged into, this will generate the most extreme behavior that the instrument is capable of.  Sometimes it will do so quickly.  Sometimes it will do so slowly.  But it <b>will</b> do it, given time.<br/><br/>Some cycles are negative:  the more something happens, the less it will happen in future.  Like pushing a rusty pendulum out of position, this type of system will allow variations from the mean, for a time, but will always wind its way back down toward that middle position, no matter how hard it gets pushed.<br/><br/>I hope nobody is surprised to hear that I think the gonzo-over-the-top-explosion common to poorly designed decentralized games is a positive feedback cycle.  At its most basic, I've seen this type of thing happen when nobody knows (starting out) what the limits are on their narration.  Each narration emboldens people to step a little bit further.  Each gonzo notion makes it more likely that gonzo notions will occur in future.  Feedback, in its most classic "unbearable fingers-on-chalkboard noise emitting from a poorly adjusted instrument" sense.<br/><br/>The first thing ... the <i>very first thing</i> ... that I think you need when designing a decentralized system is to know what negative feedback cycle is going to rein that effect in.  Often (but not always) this will be the judgment of the players.  Systems like <i>Capes</i>, <i>PTA</i>, <i>Polaris</i> and <i>Universalis</i> all have a step (often well hidden, but it's there!) where in order to take the next step into the gonzo, you need resources that only the other players can give you.  Those resources are choked off when you go gonzo in a way that not everybody is on-board with.  That's the negative feedback cycle:  Go further gonzo then the other players enjoy, and you'll find yourself starving for resources, unable to take any further steps other than back toward the consensus center.  The pendulum swings back, all without anyone having to stand up and be "the one who shuts you down."<br/><br/>Everyone with me so far?<br/><br/>Everyone get that having one guy (a.k.a. "the GM") apply that centering force directly is also a perfectly legitimate and reliable way to get that negative feedback?                        </div>

I'm very interested in specific techniques to overcome this tendency, since my next game is supposed to be pretty grim and serious out of the gate, in addition to having few narrative constraints.<br/><br/>EDIT:  Cross posted with Tony.  Of course I see the positive feedback loop in play with the Roach all the time, no surprise there.  There is literally nothing in the design to bring it to heel.  I'm OK with that.<br/><br/>So Tony, you cite external feedback - the necessary input of other players - as a way to keep things in check.  Can this be engineered internally as well?  What other mechanisms are out there?  I like your words, send more.                        </div>

                            Jason:  <i>Universalis</i> and <i>Capes</i> both have in common that part of the negative feedback comes from the players <i>realizing in advance</i> that the gonzo they're about to do is sub-optimal strategy (by comparison with some less-gonzo, centering move).<br/><br/>That first game?  Nobody realizes that ... unless there is a player there who knows it so strongly that they beat the living <b>tar</b> out of people very quickly by exploiting superior strategy.<br/><br/>That's why such games are sort of like sour-dough:  If you've got a little bit of starter, it propagates quickly.  Otherwise you've got to be patient as the culture builds up from nothing in response to the structure of the environment.                        </div>

                            I tend to go with Tony. At least, as of yet, I've had little ability to get people in these kinds of games to stick to the shit perfectly in a first game. (Crime and Punishment has a similar mode too.) <br/><br/>There was once a game I played in which one player constantly went over the top and was as gonzo as possible. After the game, while we were talking about it as a group, he said, "I don't like how this game is so gonzo all the time." We all looked at him in shock and someone else finally blurted out, "Then don't fucking do it fucko!" <br/><br/>The next week he stopped, and the game went better.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Namely, this discussion of taking steps towards distributive roleplaying, complete with diagrams:<br/><a href="http://www.collaborativeroleplay.org.uk/StartingToCollaborate" rel="nofollow">http://www.collaborativeroleplay.org.uk/StartingToCollaborate</a></blockquote>
Those diagrams are nifty! <br/><br/>However, the thing that strikes me is that instead of any of those models, the method that my Iron Heroes group employs - and which is offered up in traditional gming sections of games such as, say, GURPS - seems to be quite a bit different. Like "step one", each character player recieves the use of the "game engine", while the GM player retains the "director" and "chairperson" tags. However, the role of the "referee" is explicitly given to one of the non-GM players, who probably also shares a bit of the "chairperson".<br/><br/>I find it interesting that even in the final diagram shown only one player is given this "referee" tag - i would have thought that divying out the ability/responsibility to "call it" would be one of the earliest steps toward de-centralized/shared authority.                        </div>

                            Stefan, <br/><br/>In my experience, the referee roll becomes less important as time goes on. However, it can be good to have one person who is the final word on disputes or the final binding mediator to keep things moving. So referee as one person (or one person for any given circumstance) works well.                        </div>

                            My step two would be a refinement of step one: keeping everyone on the same page. Having structures to encourage everyone to incorporate the same themes, using workably similar tones, and engaging with the elements the others have brought into play.                        </div>

                            I'd agree that someone taking the role of facilitator really aids GMless play.  This can be formal or informal - I think it typically defaults to the most experienced player, or the person who owns the game.  In my experience this role resembles true facilitation and is a departure from the traditional GM role (since the person isn't invested with additional power).  Time management, encouraging communication, supporting interaction, and explaining procedures fall to this person.  It's not particularly stressful and can shift among participants as well.                        </div>

                            I think "agree on creative input or roll dice" is the best way of going about it (and it obviously shows up in my designs).  It seems to me that the most successful collaborative designs do things this way, e.g. Universalis and Polaris.  After all, you need to have some final say in order to move forward, which is (as people have pointed out) why the single authority solution has worked out well in the past--it's the easiest way to have a final say mechanism.  In fact, it works so well that it gave us Rule 0 to fix anything possibly wrong with any system, by letting the final say authority overrule any- and everything that doesn't fit their vision.<br/><br/>Negative feedback loops, I think, are kind of like XP rewards/penalties in traditional RPGs: using signaling and manipulating input ability to curtail behavior over time.  And it works for many people, but I'm not sure it's a cure-all for everyone.  Personally, I prefer the direct negotiation of Polaris, where everyone gets clear on what's supported and what isn't.  But I am guessing that there's a social interaction style preference at work here.                        </div>

                            Heya,<br/><br/>Reading all this makes me wonder if you guys read what Ron wrote about GMs back in November:
<blockquote>What sorts of leadership and authority are associated with this concept of "the GM"? Here's a quick rattling-off of what I've observed.<br/><br/>GMing as social organizer<br/>GMing as host<br/>GMing as rules-owner and introducer<br/>GMing as creative leader<br/>GMing as social/procedural leader<br/>GMing as player with specific authority<br/><br/>The interesting thing is that you can remove the illusory-centralizing concept of "GM" from all of these, and in doing so, a number of insights emerge. The first is that many of these can be disconnected from one another, i.e., don't have to be the same person. The second is that within any one of them, the role/function can shift from person to person without causing terrible traumas. The third is that that gaming terminology and traditions have fucked the whole thing up by nesting these functions in precisely backwards order. <br/></blockquote>
I mean, there's more in that post he makes about GMs that's really good.  But this is what is really relavant to this topic IMO.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Emily Care</cite>My step two would be a refinement of step one: keeping everyone on the same page. Having structures to encourage everyone to incorporate the same themes, using workably similar tones, and engaging with the elements the others have brought into play.</blockquote>
I think this kind of structure is very useful, a mechanism to assist the group in determining and supporting parameters or a set of precreated parameters.<br/><br/>Some games do this, some not so much.<br/><br/>When I played MLwM, which includes a degree of scene narration if I recall correctly (which I may not, it's been a while) we didn't encounter any problems.  There were clear guidelines as to the tone and structure of scene creation, the game actively supported us getting on the same page.<br/><br/>When I played octaNe, not so much, when we got narrative control over outcomes there was a noticeable tendency over time for people to introduce more and more gonzo elements.  Not as a sudden thing, but gradually.  Now, it is by nature a gonzo game of course but overall by the end of the game it had got silly in a way which I think undermined the narrative we were constructing.  Not good silly, if that makes sense.<br/><br/>octaNe had very little by way of guidance or support, and over a full session sometimes people got inspired by teh cool and sometimes not so much.  When not so much, they would often lapse into something fairly trite.<br/><br/>I don't think it's necessarily a partaking/creating issue by the way, everyone had positively wanted to play and everyone was keen to help create the narrative, nobody wanted to simply experience a GM guided plot or situation.  That wasn't the issue, the lack of practical support in actual play to keep a consistency of tone (even a consistent gonzo tone) was where things went wrong for us.<br/><br/>I've seen it with other games too, but that example sticks best in my mind.<br/><br/>Also, I'd note that octaNe has a GM, it's not a pure distributed power game, so it's not an issue of GM or no GM as in supporting shared narrative control within the game.                        </div>

                            Also, I don't think it's enough to just hand people creative control, I think you need to provide a degree of support as well which people can use or ignore as needed.<br/><br/>Take Wushu, a common actual play criticism I see of Wushu is description fatigue, people have moments in which they are inspired and moments in which they are getting a bit tired, but the rules provide no support when tired.  As a result, the game can bog down at those times, as people struggle to come up with interesting material to add to the game.<br/><br/>Ironically, the result can be that although the participants chose the game because they wanted direct creative input, not merely to participate, they end up feeling less creative as there is no support structure to assist them at moments when inspiration doesn't strike.<br/><br/>There is also an issue of what you are seeking to create, a committee creation will often lack any real power as a story or indeed even as an experience.  On rpg.net every now and again someone starts a create a setting thread.  The rules for these threads are simple, each poster adds a setting detail but may not contradict any previously contributed setting detail, though they can qualify it.  Essentially, it's a near systemless world creation game.<br/><br/>In practice, the settings created are often not that great.  Given enough contributants, someone always adds in magic, zombies, mecha or all three.  The settings end up surprisingly uncreative, often very recognisable gamer type settings, even though the only participants were people wishing to actively create and even though many participants come up with highly original contributions.  It's a kind of tragedy of the commons.  Again though, the interesting bit (for me anyway) is that nobody is there simply to participate, everyone is there to be a creator, but the process is such that the creation is frequently not very interesting.<br/><br/>Of course, it could just be that most people ain't that creative, but I think that's too simplistic an answer.  I think the real answer is that the minimal rules of the setting creation game provide no real basis for supporting creativity.                        </div>

                            A last comment for now, PTA actual play threads are interesting in this.<br/><br/>The first stage of PTA is agreeing the setting, a formalised creation of the parameters for the next stage of the creative process.  Once formalised, you then move on to creation within the parameters now established, the result judging from the actual play threads I've read seems to be a game with distributed authority and shared creative power but in which the reversion to the lowest common denominator is avoided.<br/><br/>Put another way, PTA seems a good example of a game which encourages and actively supports group story creation, without leaving people unsupported in their creative process.<br/><br/>Edit:  I think this may well be an example of the kind of structure Emily was suggesting in the bit of her post I quoted.                        </div>

                            xenop - The weakness in 'approve of creative additions or roll dice' as far as I can tell is that polite and open-minded players of the sort I have will never ask anyone to roll the dice even if they're proposing a dubious addition. After all, the thought balloon above their head goes: "nobody else is speaking up...and it might be cooler than I think...so maybe I'm wrong and it will be a great addition to the story...plus, interrupting is rude. I hate it when people interrupt me, my friend will be offended if I interrupt them. Besides, they clearly really want this to happen. If we roll the dice and it doesn't happen, they'll be disappointed."<br/><br/>I am the only one who doesn't go through this process (although the interrupting-is-rude thing is a major psychological hurdle for me), with the result that I'm the only one steering others' contributions, and at that point why don't I just GM a regular game?                        </div>

I second this with a significant degree of emphasis.  It's all nice and dandy to say, "You can tell me what happens," but if you don't have a framework you're losing a lot of opportunity.  Sometimes it's a matter of your facilitator (usually the GM) giving some prompts.  (A card game does this: you draw a card and then have certain moves you _can_ make.  To some extent, even the Amber DRPG suggests you can say, "I'm going for a full-out attack," or "I'm not committing myself completely," in a combat situation to give you that framework.)  [Heck, I'd almost feel comfortable saying that it's half the GM's job to make suggestions of next moves (supported by genre and/or system) and half to help facilitate reactions to those moves.]                        </div>

I understand that there's shyness and other issues involved, but a lot of those are social contract things that can be addressed through the game.  Polaris does this through ritualization, Universalis through currency.                        </div>

                            Hi Christian, <br/><br/>I have played Polaris and was impressed with the power of ritual phrasing.  It influenced The Roach, insofar as I recognized the need to explicitly state the obvious - that creative input nobody enjoys should be disallowed.  I've not played Universalis but I've read it.  <br/><br/>Grey Ranks has some simple inputs with complicated dependencies.  You've got mission scenes, where there are only minor thematic restrictions on your narration, based on your mechanical contribution - "if you contribute a d6, include some personal success in your narration".  Overall success or failure is collective and unknown until the last player is in the spotlight.  You've got personal scenes, with stake-setting and no thematic restrictions at all.  These are individual win-lose affairs, and in all cases, players may be angling for "failure" (which really means movement toward a particular emotional state) as often as "success".  So there is no overt mechanism (and no GM) to bring the gonzo to heel.  But the game relentlessly reinforces theme and mood in other ways, which I'm pretty confident will lead to interesting, quality play.                        </div>

                            Jason,<br/><br/>I'm in a similar boat with "The Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries." Since it's a pulp game, I actually want some degree of gonzo, but I don't want the game to descend into silly (unless everyone wants that). Narration other players like is rewarded by granting additional currency (similar to Fan Mail in PTA), and I've got a system to keep players on the same page by highlighting story elements the players want to see used again and then rewarding those who do re-use them in narration in meaningful ways (again with additional currency). But narration itself is entirely freeform, relying on the use of a veto similar to the one in Polaris to cut off content players find inappropriate. And a player can get currency simply by resolving conflicts successfully, so the additional rewards are not absolutely necessary. <br/><br/>Is there a negative feedback loop here? I am relying on the players to step up individually and veto things they don't like, which some players may be uncomfortable with. My playtests so far haven't seen a problem, but it's something I'm concerned about. The octaNe example is a good one: I love the game, but have also seen too many instances where play descended into absurdity.<br/><br/>Tony, I'm rereading Capes right now as I consider some design issues, and I'd appreciate an explanation of how the game's negative feedback cycle fits together. Can't players narrate any gonzo action they want, subject only to the And then... rule? They may not have the resources to succeed in goals or control events but they can definitely run roughshod over the theme of the game.                        </div>

<p>"Agree on creative input or roll the dice" might be a bad choice, because of the inspiration fatigue Max mentions. That's why my suggestion wasn't this, but "create or roll the dice": when you are handed creative control, you either add whatever you are inspired to, or roll dice to determine what is added and elaborate what the dice add. That's part your safety net. The other part is that there's no restriction on suggestions, so anyone can offer something to add at any time; it's just up to the one with current creative control to decide which suggestion to use.</p>
<p>This doesn't address "partake protection", but I think that's better handled with a combination of creative guidelines you must use to fit the genre plus allowing suggestions, so that when something is added that not everyone's on board with, people can voice their objections. If the current creator doesn't back down, that's a broken social contract, anyways. "Agree on creative input or roll the dice" won't work here because the odds are someone's going to suggest a dealbreaker, dice for it, and <em>win</em>, which is still a broken social contract.</p>

Brand, I agree that PTA and Universalis can be daunting at the start, but I've not had the same issues with Sorcerer &amp; Sword and other games that give a well-understood genre to start from. Any thoughts on how such games could better provide tools to prevent the initial stall out?                        </div>

Boyd</cite>Tony, I'm rereading Capes right now as I consider some design issues, and I'd appreciate an explanation of how the game's negative feedback cycle fits together. Can't players narrate any gonzo action they want, subject only to the And then... rule? They may not have the resources to succeed in goals or control events but they can definitely run roughshod over the theme of the game.</blockquote>I suspect that you're looking too closely to see the bigger loops.  There's not a feedback loop that stops somebody from narrating some particular stupid thing.  But if somebody narrates stupid stuff then nobody invests morally in their conflicts.  If nobody invests morally then that player never earns any story tokens.  People who have more story tokens get to take more actions, which means that they make up more of the narration of the game.  Hence, the gonzo-narration becomes less and less a proportion of the game as time goes on ... and that's assuming that the guy doesn't get a clue (as some people don't).  If he clues in then the effect is even more pronounced.                        </div>

                            I think you're on safe ground, Jason. Having read through Grey Ranks, especially the history section, there's no way I could bring myself to be flippant or gonzo in playing the game. I'd feel almost <i>dirty</i> in doing so. You've so clearly communicated the desperation of the historical situation that anyone who actually reads the game won't be off track.<br/><br/>That raises the issue, though, of communicating the same thematic and historical weight to the players who don't own and didn't read the book. Radio Lightning already does that to a degree, but including evocative imagery and quotes on your play materials would also strongly help.                        </div>

                            Eric, <br/><br/>Strong genre assumptions are important. Also, in Sex and Sorcery you start off with characters and kickers and such -- and so before you hit the dice rolling AP part of the game you have some additional background and idea of what the players are focused on. Folks also have little problem starting out in Crime and Punishment, both due to the genre and the fact that you write your shit down first, following a formula that's pretty easy to get into. <br/><br/>So genre, formula, and at least a few points of context (pictures, characters, pregenerated ideas) are always most helpful. Capes' click n lock are awesome here, because they let you physically tinker and from there get ideas as you move bits about.                        </div>

It's not crazy, but it's not a cure-all either.<br/><br/>Firstly, at cons one person's seriously may not be another's, which may be a reason not to play at cons but for many cons are a great way to experiment with new forms of play.<br/><br/>Secondly, it doesn't help with creativity fatigue, it doesn't help when someone wishes to take it seriously but is simply uninspired.  It also doesn't help with gonzo creep, in which no single contribution is problematic but the overal cumulative effect leads to a more gonzo outcome than anyone really wanted.<br/><br/>Nothing in this post is about TSoY by the way, I don't know it well enough to know if this is even slightly an issue there.<br/><br/>Edit:  To be clear, I'm not saying that Grey Ranks has these issues, I wouldn't know in fact, but from what you say it does address this issue through creation of mood and tone in which case the external support I refer to is present.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: talysman</cite>"Agree on creative input or roll the dice" might be a bad choice, because of the inspiration fatigue Max mentions. That's why my suggestion wasn't this, but "create or roll the dice": when you are handed creative control, you either add whatever you are inspired to, or roll dice to determine what is added and elaborate what the dice add. That's part your safety net. The other part is that there's no restriction on suggestions, so anyone can offer something to add at any time; it's just up to the one with current creative control to decide which suggestion to use.</blockquote>
I rather like this suggestion about create or roll the dice, how would it work in practice?  Do you have any examples you could provide?
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: talysman</cite>This doesn't address "partake protection", but I think that's better handled with a combination of creative guidelines you must use to fit the genre plus allowing suggestions, so that when something is added that not everyone's on board with, people can voice their objections. If the current creator doesn't back down, that's a broken social contract, anyways. "Agree on creative input or roll the dice" won't work here because the odds are someone's going to suggest a dealbreaker, dice for it, and<em>win</em>, which is still a broken social contract.</blockquote>
Protecting partaking I think is secondary, I'm not sure to be honest that shared narration games are best suited to those looking simply to partake.  A more traditional GM led game would probably deliver that with less effort.<br/><br/>That said, I think relying on objections is weak game design, if not otherwise supported, as without some external reference many people will feel uncomfortable objecting to another participant's creative input.<br/><br/>Now, that external reference can come from several places, a formal setting creation stage, game text or flavour, clear genre expectations, but I think it does need to be there.                        </div>

<p>Right, but as Tony mentioned at the start of the thread, we already know that central authority works for protecting partaking. The question here is whether it's necessarily the only way to protect partaking. Is central authority the only thing powerful enough to protect that kind of play? Is there necessarily a divide between high-creative-demand games (which work well with shared authority) and low-creative-demand participatory games (which work well with authority invested in a single creator?) Can you make shared authority work for the latter?</p>
<p>And it's true, relying on objections is weak game design, which is why I didn't suggest relying on them, but rather pairing it with the creative guidelines. A very rudimentary example: in a move to do away with fixed skill lists, I've been using the idea of skills built on a template of adjective + concrete noun, like "elven sword" or "American automobile", which would grant bonuses when using/fixing/recognizing/remembering things about the noun in question. The idea here being that a setting can define historical limits on which kinds of adjectives and nouns are available and list exceptions to the adjective or concrete noun restriction that make sense for that setting (like allowing cultures as nouns in a modern day globetrotting setting, or adding adjectives like "elven" to a fantasy setting.) That's not a full-fledged set of guidelines, yet, but it suggests a way to handle them: make them production rules and restrictions, so that anyone following the rules can create something that fits within the setting.</p>
<p>For "create or roll the dice", players choosing the first option would add something using production rules. Players who choose not to create out of whole cloth (because of a lack of inspiration or stage fright) would roll dice (or use some other randomizer)  to select generic descriptors that become seed ideas that can be elaborated. We've seen things like this before in the form of GM aids: D&amp;D/Toon random tables, or Rolemaster's rune cards (described in the Companion series,) or Whimsy Cards. It's something I used in the second draft of Co9C (motifs) and I'm using something similar in the Kanthe dungeoncrawl game I'm working on. The hard part of designing Kanthe is picking a good starting set of generic seed ideas that players can use. Once I have a good set, it's mostly gruntwork, writing out the production rules for each building block.</p>
<p>I'm about to playtest the solo mode of the most recent version of Kanthe, but once I've finished, I'll post some details on this as an example of "create or roll the dice" in action.</p>

                            Interesting thread. I'm reminded of another branch of the gaming hobby - board games. They are refereeless but do have a central authority in the rules. Once people know the rules though they are set aside and people are pretty equal. At that point it is the owner of the game who becomes the authority. They are more a host than a master though. ("No you can not stuff the counters in your beer bottle!")<br/>
<br/>
I've used a decentralized model with Engle Matrix Games where players take turns making arguments for what happens next in the game and pick another player to judge how likely their action is to happen. In this way the referee power is passed around the table willy nilly. While play can get silly, a steady guiding hand of a referee can mitigate it just like resources do in Uni.<br/>

                            Fascinating link, thanks Andy.<br/>
<br/>
What I find interesting is that most story games have systems that <i>demand</i> shared responsibility for the "rules" (fan mail, gift dice) and the story (shared character creation, player approval moderation of input). I see the ritual negotiation in Polaris as integrating both of these factors very tightly.<br/>
<br/>
If the rules of the game already expect this level of input from the table, the main issues then become:<br/>
<br/>
- how to generate creative input<br/>
- how to control creative input<br/>
<br/>
Having a set of creative "rules" (Comics code, Tenets, strong setting material) helps to do both, as they act as a <i>creative constraint</i> (look at GameChef for another example of this). Less obvious creative constraints include "shared character creation, all characters must be linked to each other in some way". Kickers and Bangs are the same, but directed (usually) at a single player. The rest is "just" social contract.                        </div>
