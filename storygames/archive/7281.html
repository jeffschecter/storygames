So.<br/><br/>I've wanted to make a TCG about relationships for a while, but only gotten a Round Tuit (I hear that they're sweeter than square ones, but I digress) after playing Bliss Stage.<br/><br/>I asked Ben Lehman about it; he said that he was interested but that he wanted to make sure that I didn't mutilate his baby (correct me if I'm wrong in the sentiment, Ben).  Fair enough.<br/><br/>Now that I've made the rules, though not the entire cardset, I wanted to post them and see how mercilessly you (and Ben) could hack them to peices.  <br/><br/>Alternitavely, if you like it, help me round out the card-list with your Actual Play of Bliss Stage.<br/><br/>I eventually want to publish this sucker: for profit split with Ben if Ben agrees: as a fan-produced labor of love if not.  <br/><br/>Any help or commentary you can give is appreciated.<br/><br/>Yours Truly,<br/><br/>Elliott Belser<br/><br/>I have posted all of the rules as comments.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser" title="Elliott Belser"><img alt="Elliott Belser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser">Elliott Belser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161830/#Comment_161830" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-10T21:10:10+00:00" title="August 10, 2008  9:10PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Basics:</b><br/><br/>The Golden Rule applies (The rules text on cards supersede the printed rules.)<br/><br/>During your turn, you represent an Authority Figure, an insomniac adult in charge of one of the few organized resistances against the aliens.<br/><br/>You also represent the Aliens, who are trying to KEEL the resistance run by the Authority Figure (player) to your immediate right, during thier turn.  (This makes no sense in anything other than a game context.  <i>''Just repeat to yourself, it's just a game, I should really just relax.''</i>)<br/><br/>The main resource in this game is <b>Bliss...</b> Sort of.  Every card you play saps a little of your strength / patience / will, represented by gaining points of Bliss.  You can gain 108 points of Bliss with no ill effect.  Gain more than this amount and you lose as you finally succumb to the Bliss and fall asleep forever: without your leadership, the resistance fails.  A card of average power nets you 4 Bliss: cheap cards can gain you no Bliss: the most expensive card to date gives you 9 Bliss.<br/><br/>To win the game, you either must be the last Authority standing (Bliss Out victory, depressingly common) or gain 13 points of Hope (Hope victory, reassuringly common).<br/><br/>You must build a deck of 50 cards.  If this is a constructed deck, you can have 4 copies of a given card.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_161835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser" title="Elliott Belser"><img alt="Elliott Belser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser">Elliott Belser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161835/#Comment_161835" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-10T21:18:38+00:00" title="August 10, 2008  9:18PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Characters <br/>Members of your Resistance.  You can only have one Character with a given name in play on your side at any given time (Assume that thier copy of Keenan Caine is in fact the similar-in-personality Eniac Naneek.  Repeat the MST3K mantra until this makes sense.)<br/><br/>Example card:<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Upwards: Intimacy 3 Trust 2 <br/><br/><b>Keenan Caine</b> -  Bliss: 7<br/><i>Carefree Hedonist</i><br/><br/>Leftwards:  Intimacy 3, Trust 2<br/>Rightwards:  Intimacy 4, Trust 1<br/><br/>Character - Hedonist Pilot<br/><br/>When Keenan Caine enters play, you may place a <br/>+1 Int / -1 Tru token on any one of his outgoing <br/>relationships with at least 2 Trust.<br/><br/><i>Why am I a pilot?  Why am I a <b>pilot?</b><br/>Dude!  Pilots get all the action!<br/>And I'm NOT talkin' bout blowing alien shit up...</i><br/><br/>Intimacy 3, | Trust 2<br/><br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Character cards have Intimacy and Trust scores at the top, sides and bottom of the cards: these are thier "Outgoing" relationships.  <br/><br/>If a printed "Outgoing" Relationship havs blank values, then they can still have "Incoming" relationships, but not Outgoing ones, in that direction.<br/><br/>Relationships are reciprocal, and the Incoming and Outgoing rels stack.  Say that Sarah Smith has 2 Intimacy 3 Trust leftwards and that Keenan Caine has 4 Intimacy 1 Trust rightwards.<br/><br/>So if you place Keenan Caine to the left of Sarah, like so:<br/><br/>K-S<br/><br/>...then the net result is that the relationship is Keenan - Int 6, Tru 4 - Sarah. <br/><br/>You could have a map like this, for example:<br/><br/><br/>Keenan  -  Int 6, Tru 3  -  Sarah  -  Int 5, Tru 7 - Nathan (because "Anchor 2" is terribly flavorful)<br/>    |<br/>Int 5, Tru 3<br/>    |<br/>Anna<br/><br/>Does this diagram make sense?<br/><br/>Anyway.  Characters can also have the subtypes Pilot and Anchor.  A Pilot can attempt to score points: an Anchor makes it much easier for a Pilot to do so.  More on that under Objectives.<br/><br/>Pilot:<br/><br/><i>Innocent</i> - tend to have high trust and abilities that boost the survival rate of other resistance members.<br/><i>Soldier</i> - tend to have high Intimacy and abilities that make it easier to win missions or play Tactics.<br/><i>Devoted</i> - make life much easier for Anchors: tend to have one good outgoing Rel and the rest of thier rels suck.<br/><i>Hero</i> - high Rels, particularly Trust, or self-destructive abilities.<br/><i>Hedonist</i> - Boost the power of everyone around them with many high-intimacy rels.<br/><i>Veteran</i> - get bennies for beginning play with Trauma.<br/><br/><br/>Anchor:<br/><br/><i>Driven</i> - increase the success rate of attempts to complete Objectives.<br/><i>Kind</i> - protect the pilot.<br/><i>Tempestuous</i> - will not die.<br/><i>Saavy</i> - boosts the capabilities of support charas.<br/><i>Comforting</i> - used to deal with Nightmare Tactics or nasty clauses in Objectives.<br/><i>Experienced</i> - Tutors, generally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser" title="Elliott Belser"><img alt="Elliott Belser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser">Elliott Belser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161837/#Comment_161837" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-10T21:19:07+00:00" title="August 10, 2008  9:19PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2008 9:41PM by Elliott Belser.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Objectives<br/><br/>The heart of the cards, as it were.  ("I'm here to kick ass and play card games, and I'm all out of ass!" - Yami Yugi, Yu-Gi-Oh: The Abridged Series)<br/><br/>Mission objectives that your Pilots and other resistances' Pilots can attempt in order to score points of Hope.  Have a Hope score and a Difficulty score.<br/><br/>Like so:<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>Engage Terror Drone! -  3 Bliss<br/>Too long they have ended us in fire.  No more!<br/><br/>Objective<br/>2 Hope for Victory - 8 Difficulty<br/><br/>Whenever any player attempts to complete any objective,<br/>thier Nightmare must pick any Character under that player's control.<br/>When they do, deal 3 Stress to that Character.<br/><br/>Whenever any player fails to complete any Objective,<br/>thier Nightmare must pick any Character under that player's control.<br/>When they do, deal 3 Stress to that Character.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>A note on Hope.  There are three "suits" of Hope, as it were: hope for Victory, hope for Humanity, and hope for Awareness.  Acheiving multiple Objectives with the same kind of Hope gives you an additional point per Objective completed beyond the first (because you're making visible progress towards winning the war, rebuilding civilization, or understanding the Bliss).  So if you have these in your score pile:<br/><br/><br/>3 Victory<br/><br/>2 Victory<br/><br/>2 Awareness<br/><br/>Then you have 8 points of hope: <br/><i>3 for Victory <br/>+ 2 for Victory<br/>+ 1 for additional Victory cards<br/>+2 for Awareness <br/>______________<br/>8 Hope total.</i><br/><br/>Hope for Victory cards deal with defeating the aliens outright, and therefore feature those aliens blasting the hell out of everyone until the objective is dealt with: they're powerful attack cards, in other words.  Staples of Bliss Out decks, and good stall cards in a Hope deck.<br/><br/>Hope for Humanity cards tend to give you additional draw power or healing abilities as you set up the infrastructure to rebuild civilization; excellent defensively, for decks designed to win the Hope races.<br/><br/>Hope for Awareness cards manipulate the feild through superior understanding of the dream-world: they allow you to rearrange decks, boast many recursion effects, get rid of Nightmare Tactics you don't like, switch up relationships already in play and so forth.  They tend towards use in shut-down decks.<br/><br/>In order to complete an Objective, you must send one or more Pilots to attempt it, and you must Anchor those pilots.  Normally this requires you to tap that ass... er, I mean "Have that Character act;" in the case of Anchoring a Pilot, a character with the Anchor sub-type can do as long as they are "ready" (untapped) without "Acting" (getting tapped).<br/><br/>In case that was obtuse:<br/><br/>A pilot MUST act in order to attempt to complete an Objective: A pilot MUST be Anchored in order to attempt to complete an Objective.<br/><br/>Any character with a relationship to a Pilot CAN Anchor that Pilot by using thier Action: Any Anchor with a relationship to a Pilot CAN Anchor that Pilot if they still have an Action, without needing to spend that Action.<br/><br/>Clear as mud, or well explained?  <br/><br/>(And, yes, a non-Anchor being able to Anchor a pilot is heresy, I know, but having a trained Anchor with thier special abilities helps <b><i>tremendously</i></b> with Attempts, to the point where using non-Anchors is a waste.  It was this or make a Mana (Anchor) Screw over-common.) <br/><br/>When a Pilot makes an attempt, you must total up the combined Intimacy of all relationships your attempting Pilot(s) have between all other Characters adjacent to them.  This is thier "Power."<br/><br/>If the Power of all your Attempting pilots equals or exceeds the Difficulty of the Objective as the attempt resolves, you score or "complete" that Objective.  Otherwise, you "fail" that Objective.  This matters as certian effects trigger off of faliure and completion.<br/><br/>You may notice that this card deals "Stress:" that's the subject of my next post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_161840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser" title="Elliott Belser"><img alt="Elliott Belser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser">Elliott Belser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161840/#Comment_161840" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-10T21:44:25+00:00" title="August 10, 2008  9:44PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stress, Trauma, and Destruction<br/><br/>You may be wondering how Pilots can be attacked.<br/><br/>Your Nightmare and/or other nasty things can deal Stress to either a Character or a Relationship.<br/><br/>If Stress is dealt to a Character, they have to distribute the accumulated Stress of a mission among thier Relationships.  Specifically, each point of Trust in a relationship can soak one point of Stress: and if you can't soak all your Stress, the Character is Destroyed.<br/><br/>This has very interesting effects when, say, the following happens:<br/><br/>Keenan <br/>   |<br/>Int 6, Tru 3 <br/>   |<br/>Sarah (5 Stress at Attempts's end)<br/>   |<br/>Int 5, Tru 4 <br/>   |<br/>Nathan (Okay, Anchor <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> from Final Act, who almost always ends up male in my games)<br/><br/>...So, which relationship gets Trauma today?<br/><br/>When the amount of Stress in a relationship equals (or if the Stress was dealt to a specific Relationship, exceeds) it's Trust, then one of the partners suffers Trauma.  <br/><br/>If the Character the Stress was inflicted on has an outgoing Relationship to the parter, they MUST take the Trauma.  Otherwise, you can place the Trauma on any Outgoing Relationship between the partners.<br/><br/>While an Outgoing Relationship has Trauma, then treat it as if it no printed Intimacy or Trust.<br/><br/>Should any Character ever have no Relationships without Trauma, that character is Destroyed:<br/><br/>1) Place Destroyed Characters in thier owner's discard pile. <br/>2) Thier controller immediately gains Bliss equal to the printed Bliss of that Character.<br/>3) Any characters with Outgoing relationships towards the Destroyed Character must place Trauma on those Outgoing Relationships!<br/><br/>A Destroyed Character is not de-facto dead.  They might be suffering from a 404 Brain Not Found, hospitalized, ostracised, Blissed Out... anything that prevents them from having normal relationships.  (A character that has been Removed From Game has been de-facto obliterated.)  It is therefore possible to play another copy or fish them from your discard, and so on.<br/><br/>If you have a copy of a character in hand as that Character takes Stress, you may respond by revealing that Character from your hand and placing it in your discard pile.  When you do, negate all Stress to that Character from that one source.  (Hidden reserves of inner strength?  Flashback Power?  Theme Song Power-Up?  Whichever seems most plausible at the time...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser" title="Elliott Belser"><img alt="Elliott Belser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser">Elliott Belser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161841/#Comment_161841" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-10T21:45:50+00:00" title="August 10, 2008  9:45PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Tactics</b><br/><br/>Tactics are basically Sorceries: play them, resolve them, discard them.<br/><br/>They come in two flavors:  Mission Tactics and Nightmare Tactics.  You play Mission Tactics to improve your Pilots' chances of success during an Attempt at an Objective: Nightmare Tactics are used to destroy or hinder the Pilots of the player on your right (when you do this, you are referred to as Thier Nightmare).<br/><br/>The right because it's anticlockwise, generally a sign of bad mojo, incidentally.<br/><br/>Another... nice... side effect of attempting an Objective is that doing so nets you Terror.  Your Nightmare can spend points of Terror from your pool in order to play Nightmare Tactics.<br/><br/>Examples of each:<br/><br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Hell-Fire Cannon - 2 Bliss<br/>Fueled by the very fires of hatred<br/><br/>Tactic - Mission<br/><br/>You must pick any attempting Pilot.<br/><br/>When you do, that Pilot gains 5 Power, this Attempt.<br/><br/>If that Pilot is in any Relationships<br/>with no more than 1 Trust, that Pilot<br/>gains 7 Power, this Attempt, instead.<br/><br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Fata Morgana - 4 Terror<br/>Just because it isn't real doesn't mean it doesn't burn<br/><br/>Tactic - Nightmare<br/><br/>You must pick any attempting Pilot.<br/><br/>That Pilot's controller has a choice.<br/><br/>When they take Option 1, deal 3 Stress<br/>to that Pilot.<br/><br/>When they take Option 2, increase the Difficulty<br/>of the Attempted objective by 5, this attempt.<br/><br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>The attempting player may play Tactics first, and then thier Nightmare can respond: this continues until both the player and the Nightmare pass in sequence.<br/><br/>The play of Tactics strictly follow Last In, First Out.

Two seems ideal, since you're screwing around with the other person.  Three seems okay, since you have stuff going back and forth.  But in a four player game, you have literally no interaction with the person across from you.  That is boring.<br/><br/>How do you intend on keeping track of bliss, stress, vp, etc?  Bliss looks like a pain in the ass- having a non-card resource that accumulates up to 108.  (I know life totals in magic can go that high or higher, but again, they're a pain in the ass when they do.)<br/><br/>It looks like you're doing a good job of capturing the theme of bliss stage, but that shouldn't be your main design goal- making a good game in and of itself should be.<br/><br/>You should name characters after Bliss Stage playtesters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162018/#Comment_162018" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-11T12:41:24+00:00" title="August 11, 2008 12:41PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My initial impression: looks like a solid set of CCG mechanics, reminiscent of a lot of the classics I used to play, while doing justice to the Bliss Stage fictional material and cycle of play events. Cool!<br/><br/>What I'm wondering is just how you intend this CCG to be "about relationships." While the fictional "skin" for the mechanical interactions is straight-up Bliss Stage, it seems likely that the relationships will remain just that--a "skin," a thin veneer the gameplay directed toward the TRUE purpose--to <i>win.</i><br/><br/>Now to be sure, when I was into CCGs I tool pleasure in constructing, partly internally and partly verbally to the other player(s), a metastory of what was actually happening fictionally to the implied characters and setting as we played. But it was more or less an idle pursuit, a little icing on the cake of actually playing competitively, and while I preferred games that facilitated this sort of pseudo-narrative, it never reached the point of actual story-creation in a satisfying emotional/cathartic sense. Games that came closest were ones where the card play very directly corresponded to fictional events occurring, like the Lovecraftian <i>Mythos</i> CCG. But I'm not sure a card game can really facilitate an intense experience like that intended for Bliss Stage the roleplaying game.
