Whenever I've played it, I've had a ball.  Whenever I've run it, I've had very mixed results, but I've never actually enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The first game I ran was disastrous.  We came up with a pretty cool sounding show, but the three players were all pulling in different directions.  The game didn't work and we quickly aborted it.<br/><br/>The second game is running at the moment.  We're going to be running the 3rd episode tonight.  The game is running fine and everyone is having a great time, except for me.  I'm just kind of sitting there, trying to point the players toward the conflict in each of their scenes and drawing cards when I need to.  I play the odd NPC, but to be honest I'm not really doing much of anything.  The game's pretty much running itself, and frankly I'm a bit bored.<br/><br/>So what do I do?  I'm reluctant to step in and direct the plot in any given way.  I suggest stuff to player who are stuck in setting a scene and whatnot, but to be honest the players are pretty creative and don't really need my input.<br/><br/>I think the problem comes down to this:  I ran games for a great number of years where I was the GM and therefore ruled as a god.  Which is how most people played to be fair.  I was a benevolent god and pretty much let the players do whatever they wanted as long as I thought it was cool, and I'd write "plots" for the characters the players presented to me.  So in jargon terms, it was distinctly Story Before, but the story was heavily influenced by the players.  I'm now (I think) overcompensating by being very, very hands off and pretty much letting the players create the story themselves, just touching them along every now and then when they get stuck, but (and here's the problem) not actually creating anything much myself.<br/><br/>So how do I find that happy medium?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75577/#Comment_75577" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-14T06:36:49+00:00" title="June 14, 2007  6:36AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Rich,<br/>\n<br/>\nMy answer is: you're a player too. Add your ideas. Give NPCs agendas and run with them. Don't be afraid to push story points that interest you. Sure your role is to support an overall story that helps the players focus on their issues, but that doesn't mean you don't get to push plot -- just that you have to give up control of where it goes. The PTA rules won't let you dominate the game, and it sounds like you have a robust group of players who aren't going to suddenly become passive. Your players may well be pleased to have the pressure turned up a notch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75578/#Comment_75578" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-14T06:39:10+00:00" title="June 14, 2007  6:39AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rich Stokes</cite>So what do I do?

Make sure that every NPC wants something from at least one PC (this doesn't have to be negative, it can be "I want to escape the doomed planet with you"), and that the PCs want at least one thing from one NPC. Then, whenever a PC is in a scene with this NPC, push hard with this desire. Have other NPCs come in with desires that are partially in line with the PC's.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuddenly you're playing interesting, vibrant characters who are an important (if not central) part of the story, and capable of increasing the pressure on the characters, but without simply decreeing the plot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75580/#Comment_75580" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-14T06:43:11+00:00" title="June 14, 2007  6:43AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude, get hands on.

Just don't be wedded to anything in particular.  So for example, I had a group of ex-National Guard meth dealers who were stealing military weapons and selling them to the Russian mafia.

Hard as I rail against that type of thing, old habits die hard and I've had other games fall into that trap.  I realise that I'm going too far in avoiding that type of behaviour, becoming almost passive rather than reactive to the players.<br/><br/>To clarify, I'm not having a horrible time.  If I was, I'd have canned this game.  The players are all great guys and I know they'd be OK if I did that.  But I'm only just enjoying it enough to want to complete the remaining three episodes of the series.  For me, the game <b>is</b> fun, it's <b>not</b> awesome.  Everyone else thinks it's great.  Not their fault at all I'm not rocking out like I ought to be.<br/><br/>I find enjoyment of more Gamist oriented games very easy.  Like Agon or Savage Worlds.  There, it's pretty obvious how to enjoy the game as GM without trampling the players.  Chuck some dice about!  Create some neat villains for the PCs to kill etc etc.<br/><br/>Here it's a bit less clear how to have fun.<br/><br/>Alan, what you've just said is exactly what I have felt for a while, but I'm finding it very hard to actually do that.<br/><br/>Likewise, Robert, that's all very true, but again, it's putting that into effect that's the hard bit.<br/><br/>Remi/Jason, great hands-on advice.  I think you've (inadvertently) hit on something really important that I've sort of missed: These are my fucking NPCs, and I'll control them.  The system won't let me run the game like an arsehat (something I've known all along) so I should let the system take care of keeping me in check and rock out with the NPC like I normally do.<br/><br/>I think, actually, this all comes from me compensating for gaps in most systems.  Gaps that PtA simply doesn't have.  The <i>je ne sais quoi</i> of being a "good gm" and not railroading the player just doesn't enter into it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75594/#Comment_75594" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-14T07:17:42+00:00" title="June 14, 2007  7:17AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can I suggest sharing your fears with your players, and appointing them to be watchdogs over you?

This gives the Producer TREMENDOUS power to add twists to every scene.  We're on season two of our PtA game for which I'm the producer.  Part of my job is to push the agenda of the NPCs as hard as I can, and the fact that I have framing power over every single scene is my primary method of doing this.  (Note: I don't always USE my power if a player really has something specific in mind but sometimes a player will have just an idea of what they want their character to be "up to" so to speak and then I use my framing power to twist a knife in it).<br/><br/>Example from own game.  In the game Violet is a brilliant clockwork engineer and she's currently investigating a mysterious message her dead father left her.  Her player gives me: Focus: Plot, Location: CIty Library, Agenda: Violet researching the mysterious map she's found.<br/><br/>As Producer I narrate that the scene opens with Violet walking through the stacks, pulling books off the shelf comparing drawings inside with her maps when suddenly she hears familiar voices on the other side of shelf.  The voices turn out to be Stephen (Violet's love interest) and Mademoiselle LePointe (a mysterious young woman who attacked Violet earlier in the story).  Both are NPCs with strong agendas driven by me.<br/><br/>Also remember to use narration rights when you win/lose a conflict to spin the ball as hard as you can.  A good thing to keep in mind is that winning Narration means you get to say WHY someone succeeds and that doesn't have to be direct 1-to-1 with character action.  The last conflict of the last episode a player was trying to stop a wedding.  He succeed but I, as Producer, won narration.  He was able to stop the wedding because he snuck out the back door with the bride while everyone was distracted by the fact that the police had just arrived to arrest a different player character.<br/><br/>The Producer has power in PtA.  It's just in weird places and you have to learn how to use it.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75648/#Comment_75648" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-14T10:41:09+00:00" title="June 14, 2007 10:41AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Jesse.

I mean, I'm all for hippy let everyone do their thang stuff, but not at the expense neutering "here's some story and IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT AT YOUR FACE" stuff which I rely on from a GM and *need* a GM supply to me as a player in order for me to truly enjoy the game.<br/><br/>I've played in several PTA games at this point and always had fun, but it's been very, very rare that I've walked away feeling like I've had an emotional connection to any character at the table.  I think this was because I felt too much in control of my destiny; some element of that equates to the death of discovery-delight and surprise in terms of how I emotionally experience the game.<br/><br/>All of which is me saying, dude -- if you know you're being a "weak" GM by your old standards, STOP BEING THAT.  If there are any players at the table who are like me, there's a decent chance that they may be having fun but they're wanting some of what you've got to give, all the same.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76211/#Comment_76211" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-17T09:20:46+00:00" title="June 17, 2007  9:20AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 17, 2007 9:23AM by iago.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looking at the later comments, I think my point about "not enough explicit exhortation" is shored up by Rich missing the bit about the Producer being responsible for framing EVERY scene.  Like -- that's something I've missed too, and I've read the game cover to cover at least twice (though not in recent memory).  I think it's such a throwaway idea -- in terms of its presentation in the text -- that it literally just slides off the comprehension of the reader because there's so little to make that feel like a consistent "vibe" with the rest of the game.<br/><br/>I for one would like to see a lot more flag-waving around that concept in the game, and I'd honestly like to see a lot more of it in the play of PTA I've had.
