If the conversation goes bad - or someone says something you find actually offensive, say the phrase "[real name here] - why not try that again".  People playing these games can get carried away, and sometimes just a gentle nod can move the game back to where you want it to be.<br/>2. Yes and, no but. Do not resist the fiction, if someone says something about your character unless it's disprovable untrue, go with it.<br/>3. Similarly, if you do not know something about your character, and you are asked it, make it up! <br/>4. None of your characters are criminals or have done anything illegal. Or at least, they won't admit it on TV. They can really look like a murderer, or have a suspiciously large amount of counterfeit cigarette boxes, or make regular trips to the door to swap packages for money with the various people from the neighborhood, but they cannot admit to a crime on the show. <br/>5. To ensure proper engagement, the producers of the show have asked all the guests to roll on this chart 3 times. If they do not know the answers to the questions, for each guest by the end of the show, they are disqualified. <br/><br/>   1. If you could have an endless supply of any food, what would you get?<br/>  2.  If you were an animal, what would you be and why?<br/>   3. What is one goal you\u2019d like to accomplish during your lifetime?<br/>    4. When you were little, who was your favorite super hero and why?<br/>   5. Who is your hero? (a parent, a celebrity, an influential person in one\u2019s life)<br/>   /// twenty more questions go here<br/><br/><br/>STEP 1 CHARACTER CREATION:<br/><br/>Everyone gets together and writes the worst traits of a dinner party guest on index cards. Make it a sentence. For instance "Always wants to talk about the novel they are writing "<br/>"Seems to be completely illiterate - but gets irate if anyone brings it up "<br/>"Can't take any kind of criticism without breaking down into hysterical fits of tears"<br/>"Creepy obsessed with John Wilks Booth"<br/>Write about 40 odd cards, between the four of you. Talk about some, but keep some as a surprise. Then turn them to face down.<br/><br/>You pick up 4 cards randomly. If you hate your hand, throw it away and pick up more. It doesn't really matter.  So long as you end up with 4 cards it's fine. <br/><br/>You then describe your appearance, any other details you wish to elaborate on.<br/><br/>Throughout this process, ensure your character is completely different from you!<br/><br/>If you are a man, be a woman. If you are gay, you are now straight. If you are fat, you are now thin. If you are loud and boisterous, you are now boring and timid. This is important, because if the character is you, then you are just going to spend the evening getting trashed, and that's no fun. <br/><br/>You must stick to the intent of the cards. <br/><br/>Decide who will go first to host. <br/><br/>The host then gets to decide what hilarious costumes they want everyone to come dressed in. <br/><br/>STEP 2: BEFORE THE FOOD<br/><br/>The game starts when the first guest arrives. <br/><br/>Hopefully in the kind of hilarious and thoroughly appropriate outfit that one would naturally want to meet a group of strangers in.<br/><br/>Once all the guests arrive, the host can start cooking. <br/><br/>Player Tip: make sure you use this time to trash the menu, the other party goers and the decor of the room you are in. <br/><br/>Player Tip: make sure you get inappropriately drunk before the food is served. <br/><br/>The 'Come Dine With Me' crew must approve of the menu before you start cooking and after you have finished, ensuring you have not poisoned anyone and that you stick to dietary requirements.  Other than that, the food can be as bad as you want. Just<br/>keep in mind, you and your friends will have to probably eat it in real life. <br/><br/>STEP 3: DINNER!<br/><br/>You eat dinner. The guests ask each other questions, and give answers, just like strangers who are having a dinner party. Except everyone is furiously writing notes and asking questions, all while pretending to be bastards, and pretending that each other are saints. <br/><br/>Frame the Scene!<br/><br/>The host gets to decide what their living room and kitchen look like. What visible props are lying around, what is the decor, how does it smell. Use that power and be vivid.<br/><br/>"When We Were Looking Around Your House, We Found This Thing"!<br/><br/>At the start of the show the guests 'walked around the hosts house' and found somthing unusual, a conversation starter.<br/><br/> Everyone gets one thing they can show the host, that they 'found lying around the house' which immediately becomes true.<br/><br/>They might find your Nobel peace prize. Or your litter of cute puppies. Or that check you wrote out to 'The needy'. It's your job to quickly explain why you are still a bastard. <br/><br/>Cutaway!<br/><br/>If a player points to another player, makes a square with their finger around the players face, and says aloud "CUTAWAY!" then they are calling for a cutaway interview. <br/><br/>A player may also nominate themselves for a cutaway, by pointing at their own face and saying "CUTAWAY" but the rest of the group must majority consent for this to happen by saying 'Yes'<br/><br/>The nominated character must monologue what they are thinking and feeling as if filmed in a cutaway interview while holding their fingers in a square gesture over their face. Use this opportunity to hammer home some home truths, the kind of thing which you wouldn't say to someone's face. <br/><br/>The Entertainment.<br/>At the end of every night, its time for the host to do his entertainment. Do you have no idea how to play the saxophone? then maybe enthrall your guests with a quick improvised melody!  <br/><br/><br/>STEP 4: THE VOTE!<br/><br/>It is an open vote, and other players can contest. They can say for instance "HEY I had a great time at your meal dick head, the food was fucking divine, and the conversation was fucking enthralling. I was the fucking shit one mate, i said all that weird inappropriate stuff about this guys mom! "<br/><br/>At the end, everyone gives everyone who isnt them a number from one to ten. The person with the least votes wins, and gets the victory moment of standing up and having a hissy fit over not winning a thousand pounds.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V" title="Tore_V"><img alt="Tore_V" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V">Tore_V</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469554/#Comment_469554" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-01T08:41:11+00:00" title="February  1, 2018  8:41AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the basic concept, except the "Make sure you play something entirely different from yourself". That works great in theory, rarely so in the real world. You need something real to draw on, in my experience. If you make it too different, it will feel off, not just to the player, but the other players as well.<br/><br/>You really need a hot-seat sequence, something off-stage where the characters can reveal their true thoughts and feelings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dannyrklg1" title="dannyrklg1"><img alt="dannyrklg1" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dannyrklg1">dannyrklg1</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469582/#Comment_469582" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-02T11:23:12+00:00" title="February  2, 2018 11:23AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the feedback!<br/><br/>One thing i was a little anoyed at rereading it today was the tonal changes, like it seems like this game is both excited for the players to be awful to one another, but also simultaniously telling the players off for being awful. <br/><br/>The make sure you 'play somthing different from yourself' thing is more just me wanting to put the breaks on.

Every. Damn. Year.<br/>They eat the exact same foods, and discuss the exact same subjects, ond it's all about <i>not</i> discussing anything important, because that will ruin the good mood.<br/>For every year, secrets are added, and it becomes harder and harder to keep quiet about the uncomfortable truths.<br/>Also, the players actually have to eat this damn depressing food for every year.<br/>It's very much written with a Danish audience in mind, but it works quite well across cultures. We do, however, have a thing about eating the exact same foods for specifik festive occasions, and woe become those who suggest a change of menu. It's very much a point of contention when you get married, especially around Christmas, because if your new family prefers pork roast to duck at Christmas, or, Heaven forfend, <i>turkey</i>, it's cause for divorce. or you cook both.<br/>(We're very inclusive. We have duck, goose, roast pork and sausage and three kinds of red cabbage in order to satisfy everyone. And that easily lasts us till new year since we're only four adults and two children).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
