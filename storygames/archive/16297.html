I have been preparing a Marvel Heroic Roleplaying campaign.  One of the things that I'm psyched about but don't "get" that much is Unlockables.  I love them so much but I have a hard time writing them.  I'd loooove to do them for more personal milestones (or power-related milestones, or whatnot), although they're much easier to write for Event Milestones. Does anyone have any thoughts on this? <br/><br/>Specifically, how would you write an Unlockable for (say) a Milestone about joining/being accepted as a member of a team?<br/><br/>I wrote some more Unlockables for the SHIELD Super-Agent event Milestone in the main book, see what you think: <a href="http://theinterestingpeople.tumblr.com/post/20795132690/shield-super-agent-event-milestones-and-unlockables" rel="nofollow">The post.</a>  (The tumblr itself is not quite up to speed yet.)  <br/><br/>The main question I have is whether you think it's kosher to have an unlockable Asset or Complication be in addition to already-existing assets and complications without spending a Plot Point.  In other words, normally you get to roll 1 Asset for free. With this Unlockable, I give you the ability to roll 2 for free for a limited time, costing XP instead of Plot Points.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372180/#Comment_372180" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-10T13:30:25+00:00" title="April 10, 2012  1:30PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I suspect that the system is robust enough that anything you do is unlikely to break it, especially if they had to work for it in the first place, and doubly so if it's just for a limited time.<br/><br/>No ideas for a team unlockable mechanically, but I envision something with calling in backup, or forcing the team to follow your lead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372194/#Comment_372194" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-10T14:17:52+00:00" title="April 10, 2012  2:17PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thing is that I'm not sure Unlockables should force <i>PCs</i> to do things...I thought about that though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372199/#Comment_372199" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-10T14:29:42+00:00" title="April 10, 2012  2:29PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 10, 2012 2:30PM by Ludanto.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe this is why unlockables are tied to event milestones.<br/><br/>You could go Dungeon World on it.
