A lot of what's already in CF is perfrect. Mentors work well, the various conflict arenas are excellent but some things that are missing are mass-combat rules and noble house creation/maintenance rules. I still haven't worked out House creation but I've converted the Mentors and come up with a mass combat system inspired by both Savage Worlds and the official SoIaF rpg. Here is how the mass combat works, at least in beta;<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a link to the stats for the various types of military units available so far. Most notably missing are siege weapons. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aka_iGRNRo6BdElyZEVnVjJwdlZQOU9CaWUzSlNQYVE<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this system works best with counters, poker chips, or mini's to represent the battlefield and locations in a very broad and abstract way. Better to keep it simple with a nice clean system like CF. <br/>\n<br/>\nEach army selects a Commander to run each side of the attack. Usually this will be a PC and an NPC, no biggy.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach army begins play with 3 ardor to spend.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach side then rolls opposed Scouting rolls to determine turn order and see who has the tactical/terrain advantage. (Scouting rank will be determined in the not yet thought out house creation system but for example will range from d4-d12 as many things in CF do.) Ties will be re-rolled until a victor is assigned. The winner of the roll may place a d8 aspect  (ie. higher ground, flanked, hidden, etc) on his or his opponent's army. If a double success is scored it is a d10 aspect and triple success means d12.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe armies are then divided into units agreed to by both sides. For example if one army consists of 300 man-at-arms and 100 archers and the other is 200 man-at-arms and 200 cavalry then the first army would have 3 units of man-at-arms and 1 unit of archers and the second army would have 2 units of man-at-arms and 2 units of cavalry.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach Commander must assign themselves to a unit. PC's and NPC's who are not commanding but wish to take part in the battle must also assign themselves to a unit. NPC's and PC's who are assigned to a unit and wish to act may do so only once per round and only to perform maneuvers. If their unit loses vigor or suffers an injury, the PC or NPC suffer them as well. If any character's unit is destroyed they must join another unit to continue participating in the battle.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Commanders now roll a Command skill check adding any appropriate tools, such as their banner, to the roll. For each success, they may activate one unit in their army in this round. Turn order begins with the Commander who won the initial scouting roll and continue until all actions are exhausted. This process is repeated until the battle is ended.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach unit, when activated may attempt a Dash, Ride, or Boat check at DC 4, using any appropriate tools as usual, to approach an enemy unit to attack. Exceptions include units with range (such as archers or siege weapons) or units who are already engaged with the activated unit. Units may be activated more than once in a round if the Commander has the actions available. Once in range they may attack the enemy unit with the appropriate skill and the enemy unit may defend as per the normal conflict rules in CF. Units may choose to suffer injuries just like individual characters may but as usual may never reduce the vigor lost by less than 1. If a unit loses all their vigor points they are injured as per the normal conflict rules and are routed, surrender, or decimated.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf an army is located within a fortress the enemy suffers a penalty equal to the size of the fortress. So for example when attacking a small tower the attacking units suffer a d6 penalty to all rolls and when attacking a huge fortress (like Winterfell) they suffer a d20. Makes attacking units in defensible locations very difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's what I have so far. I still need to work on rules for retreat and something to help determine survivors of both sides of a conflict, like some sort of post battle Command roll or something to recoup loses. Dunno yet. As you can see in the army stat sheet i've assigned a cost to each type of unit and this will most likely be a cost per number of people in said unit. For example the cost of 5 for cavalry may purchase you 50 cavalrymen whereas the cost of 3 man-at-arms will purchase you 100 men. This will hopefully work into the house creation system I am developing. If you have any advice or ideas or criticisms please share them. This is my first attempt at anything like this and I want it to end as a good working system so I can start playtesting with my home groups. Thank you all for your time.<br/>\n<br/>\nPheylorn<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, almost forgot, here is the link to my adapted Mentors list. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aka_iGRNRo6BdGRPQzlIUVZLS0M4ZVYwaEpaR1hzYkE                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381638/#Comment_381638" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-09T16:12:00+00:00" title="June  9, 2012  4:12PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's Wonderful Andrew!

If a character wants to run, he uses his Dash skill dice (say D8) and any appropriate tool that the player can justify, for example a pair of hard boots (D6). If the character also has an appropriate aspect (such as Super Fit), then that aspect dice can also be applied (D8). However, the character loses one point of Ardor to invoke an Aspect. This character would then roll D8 + D6 + D8 against a target number which could either be set by the GM or rolled randomly. Two successes are better than 1 success, and three are even better. If a character has a negative Aspect, then it will reduce his dice pool, but will also add 1 to his Ardor total.<br/><br/>T<br/><br/>If you can use your trade you get 1D (so for running almost any would be acceptable), if any tool applies you get 1D, so for example [hard boots]. Now here is where it differs somewhat. You get 1D for any of the four trademark moves you can use, so it's possible you could have an actual move called [Dash]. I have positive aspects as well called trumps, but you don't need to spend a point to activate it. The character then rolls (in this case) 3D [trade] [tool] [move]. Successes work about the same. A negative condition adds a penalty die (mine also has tolls, which work the opposite of positive aspects).<br/><br/>Cool! I hadn't even heard of this game. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn" title="Pheylorn"><img alt="Pheylorn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nPL8Z6QVE6S71.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn">Pheylorn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385528/#Comment_385528" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-21T11:06:23+00:00" title="July 21, 2012 11:06AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/jacksonmalloy">@jacksonmalloy</a><br/><br/>Those mass combat rules you posted are awesome, I like it.
