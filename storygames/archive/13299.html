It's the first time that I've run this game and I'm looking for any advice from people who have run it before that I can use to make my session run amazingly well!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe constraints that I have are that the session has a hard time limit of &lt; hours, it has to come to a satisfying conclusion during that session, and I may have six players rather than five (excluding me) all of which are likely to be D&amp;D-style players with little to no indie-rpg/story game experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice, hints, tips will be enthusiastically welcomed.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299378/#Comment_299378" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-04T17:00:31+00:00" title="November  4, 2010  5:00PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It says it in the text, but it's worth repeating: Ask questions! I feel like asking questions and using the answers is something that's emphasized much more in indie gaming, make the most of it. Remind the players the world is theirs to fill in, you don't know anything more than they do.<br/><br/>As far as the time limit, what a roll means can be pretty open to interpretation. When I run the game, I tend to let rolls accomplish a lot, and hence things move fast (too fast for my taste, often). Keep that in mind, choose when to roll and what the roll will accomplish carefully.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/forlorn1" title="forlorn1"><img alt="forlorn1" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/n6SIEC3F01EX7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/forlorn1">forlorn1</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299381/#Comment_299381" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-04T17:08:06+00:00" title="November  4, 2010  5:08PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here is my advice that I emailed a friend getting ready to run LB for the firs time.  Take from it what you will. (and let the flames begin)<br/><br/>- The GM has no agency in conflicts other than setting the difficulty level of the challenge.  Make your conflicts accordingly.  Have the the fact that 'players can always win if they spend enough' in mind.  Never make a conflict they HAVE to loose.<br/><br/>- players only get to pick tags from one trait for dice.  Unless they have the key of experience.<br/><br/>- Treat the first hour and possibly the whole game as an action film. The game has a huge amount of forward energy out of the gate.  Things will happen fast, big changes will come about.  If it starts to lag in politics or social stuff, be ready to jumpstart it back up with conflict.<br/><br/>- The characters are big damn heroes, expect them to be that way.  Don't make a situation that they need to be scared in, cause its not going to happen.<br/><br/>- Kale is the hardest character to get spotlight time to.  All the rest pretty much collect spotlight as they go.<br/><br/>- Snarggle will annoy you at first, but if played right, can be an exceptional character.  Give Snarggle to a player that can hit the key of banter in real life.<br/><br/>- push the Naomi ex-slave pit fighter thing if things get boring. Nothing get things going again like watching Naomi crush some opposition.<br/><br/>- Although the rules say 'don't preplan', have something in mind for the meeting with Uriah Flint.  It will generally come up.  I have had him married off to a mousy woman (Lady B left, desponded),  married to another noble, Lady Moonbeam (Lady B ended up in a sorcery duel with the other woman), or out on a pirate raid. <br/><br/>YMMV                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299383/#Comment_299383" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-04T17:12:09+00:00" title="November  4, 2010  5:12PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't worry too much about the aspects and tags and secrets and stuff. If a player says they're using something, ask how it looks. Using Strength to get by a door looks different than using Stealth (I'm making up aspect names here; I can't recall what's what), but they're both applicable. Stormbloods could even short out the circuitry. Just go with what makes sense; they're aren't tightly designed skills. Plus, you'll get a lot of neat narration out of your players if you let them try and work seemingly inappropriate aspects into scenes. It's fun!<br/><br/>It's a game that practically runs itself, but if you have a hard time limit you'll have to do a little more prompting than usual. If your players don't have any story-game experience, make sure you show and tell them how to play the game! Advocate for themselves when they hit keys, try to describe as many tags as they can, don't be afraid to embellish scenes, kibbutz around the table, etc.<br/><br/>These are just things that worked for me. Good luck!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299395/#Comment_299395" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-04T20:07:18+00:00" title="November  4, 2010  8:07PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just escaping the hand of sorrow can be a satisfying conclusion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299396/#Comment_299396" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-04T20:30:01+00:00" title="November  4, 2010  8:30PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jamie raises an excellent point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/KynnBartlett" title="KynnBartlett"><img alt="KynnBartlett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/KynnBartlett">KynnBartlett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300104/#Comment_300104" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T13:14:16+00:00" title="November  9, 2010  1:14PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, how'd it go?
