I read it (go ahead, read it yourself, it's not long), and...  Well, is it just me or would something like this be amazing for live-action play?  Like, you and your opponent are standing facing each other, and at a signal you both commence casting your spells by performing the appropriate hand gestures (there'd need to be referees, one to watch &amp; interpret each player's gestures and match it to the spell list), then the effects are applied, then you do another round, and so on until someone dies.<br/><br/>What really got me thinking about this is where the review says "You recognize D[igit] as an aggressive gesture, while W[ave] is more defensive."  That there's some underlying stuff there means that, even if you don't have all the spells memorized, you can get an idea of what the spell is for.<br/><br/>And, of course, the real strength of doing this in live action is that, as your performing your spell, you're also watching your opponent perform his spell, and maybe you realize what he's casting so you <i>change your spell</i> accordingly.  You wouldn't be able to take back the gestures you've already made, but you could change the ones you were planning on doing but haven't done yet.  It's like changing your move in rock-paper-scissors, but with constraints that make it a viable part of the game.<br/><br/>Wouldn't this be cool?<br/><br/>-Marshall                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175104/#Comment_175104" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-15T15:15:46+00:00" title="October 15, 2008  3:15PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did you read the actual Spellcaster rules, linked to from the review?  Because the changing spells midstream seems to be a common part of the tactical situation of the game.  (And some other comments also imply that you didn't click the next link.)<br/><br/>The Spellcaster spell list as such seems to unwieldy for actual LARP play, but the basic idea could maybe be used for such.  If you simplified the thing somewhat, then I don't see why you'd need referees for conflicts anyway (and as far as I'm concerned if a system needs referees for its conflicts, that means it's a bad system for LARPing).  After each turn, the players check to see what spells go off, and determine what happens.  The game as written doesn't even need a ref.<br/><br/><br/>The basic mechanic would be totally sweet for a Street Fighter/Mortal Kombat game, where each gesture is the equivalent of a move that is used for big combos.  Maybe characters all access the same pool of combo moves except for a few special moves only they can access, or something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175178/#Comment_175178" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-16T08:03:31+00:00" title="October 16, 2008  8:03AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, as it is, it's a bit too complex. UNLESS... you get a hack of the Linux network game running on BREW or J2ME and play it on cell phones, with texting (or Bluetooth) as the networking protocol. In fact... that's my new killer app. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Oh, wait, damn... can't make money off of it. <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> But it would still be a cool mini game to integrate within a LARP.<br/><br/>A possible problem is that you play 'to the death" and that makes for fast games. Frankly, it could be too zero-sum for any kind of LARP--what's to keep it from being just a tournament or circle of death? Consider this: what if you used, say, simplified chess as a resolution system, with checkmate (or king capture, if you do speed chess) as "death?"<br/><br/>So... it would have to NOT be death. Maybe when you're at 0 Life, you can only move slowly (step per second) and can't initiate a conflict (but can defend until they do a point to you, say). "Heal" 1 Life every five minutes or whatever. Think of it more like "Vitality" and, thus, capacity to engage in the overall storyline or quests--moving slow is generally bad, for scavenger hunts or line modules; and being unable to initiate a conflict means others' narrations of situation will win out over yours.<br/><br/>You know... come to think of it, this would be REALLY sweet mechanism for a Mage game, with no GMs (or only NPC crew, to portray normals/Sleepers). Every point of Vitality you spend lets you dictate an aspect of the area you're in--similar to use of a Coin for a Fact in Universalis--but you're then you're more vulnerable in a duel until you heal up. Have each area contain some kind of poster board and marker, so that Facts can be recorded for others to see (or scratched out, if others undo them). Your Vitality is used in Waving Hands duels, Fact creation, and to stay out of Quiet (say, you go into Quiet if you hit 0 Vitality). Backlash could be -3x the Vitalty spent to cause Fact(s), if the transition (i.e. the statement of the new Fact(s) and writing it on the poster) is seen by a Sleeper.<br/><br/>Hmmmmm.... this is very interesting. I wonder how hard that port and networking would be...?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175190/#Comment_175190" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-16T09:49:30+00:00" title="October 16, 2008  9:49AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nick,<br/>No, I only read the review.

My whole notion of running it as the "magic" mechanics in a Mage game just don't fly, eh? And you don't see RP potential in the Enchantment Spells? I mean, not EVERY fight has to go to 0 Life, right? Each Enchantment (as appropriate) could have an "RP Option," which ends the duel (i.e. I'd rather send you off Blind for a few minutes than get the mechanical bonus of not seeing your gestures).<br/><br/>Plus, the multiplayer aspect could be really sweet.

RPS is, in a sense, a gestures game to resolve win/lose/tie (though it has too much skill involved, for my tastes). Maybe one could come up with a more extensive variant than just RPS, that would still be easy to learn and memorize (four/five elements?). Say:<br/>Water &gt; Earth &gt; Fire &gt; Metal &gt; Air ( &gt; Water), and the "success level" is a factor of how close you are to the element you beat (ex: Water would have "2 successes" versus Earth, but only one versus Fire; and Metal would get one versus water, while Air would get two).<br/><br/>Or maybe it could get all avant, with more freeform gestures that are interpreted aesthetically (or like charades, maybe?). Heck, how about American Sign Language, with gestures being "spells" you cast as descriptions of the effect you want.<br/><br/>OK, just brainstorming off-topic, now.<br/>----<br/>If you radically simplified Waving Hands, you could do it "live" and even in real-time (which is the basic idea behind <a href="http://davidartman.com/games/icecaster" rel="nofollow">Icecaster</a>).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175252/#Comment_175252" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-16T21:44:06+00:00" title="October 16, 2008  9:44PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tony dowler</cite>something more like the key phrases of Polaris, except instead of key phrases, you have key gestures.</blockquote>\nWhich begins to sound like Shreyas's game <a href="http://bleedingplay.wordpress.com/push-1/" rel="nofollow">Mridangam</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
