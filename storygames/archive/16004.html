I'm planning on telling the players that it plays like a Marvel issue of "What If...?" I want to avoid the comic snobs from pushing around the plot to their hearts content while sacrificing everyone else's fun, so I'm laying down the law of "Just because it happened in the comic doesn't necessarily means it happens when interpreted to other mediums, or by other writers." I <i>know</i> I'm going to get a few players who are hard-nosed must-work-as-written comic fanatics who'll argue the point of "I should be able to defeat The Purple Man handily, because according to the Breakout story arc, he was pumped full of drugs to keep his powers from working...etc. etc.", so hopefully by stating this up front, it should quell any opposition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364623/#Comment_364623" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T10:30:45+00:00" title="March  2, 2012 10:30AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Michael, great ideas!<br/><br/>The other thing I forgot to mention is these Marvel parties are step 1 on the road to Gen Con.

I printed them off yesterday and used them in a game that was being run by a first-time GM. Your cheat sheet totally helped Molly from Runaways use her super-strength to rip the Carnage symbiote out of her own throat by drawing on her own panic and fear (d10 emotional stress).<br/><br/>There were some things the Watcher was doing during the game that I didn't understand. Now I've had a look at your Hero Cheat Sheet a little more closely, I'd suggest thinking about the following:<br/><br/>- Moving the first two points in 'Adjusting Effect Dice' ('If your total is 5 or more ...' and 'If you step up an Effect die ...') to the Rolling Dice section. I'd put them between Steps 12 and 13.<br/><br/>- In the 'Using Plot Points before you roll' section, I'd move 'Add one of your own stress dice' higher in the list. It's an awesome option that I totally overlooked until the end of the game.<br/><br/>- In the 'Rolling Dice' section, you might want to do something to indicate that Step 11 is a little different to the other steps (as it tells you to repeat the previous 10 steps for your opposition).

I printed them off yesterday and used them in a game that was being run by a first-time GM. Your cheat sheet totally helped Molly from Runaways use her super-strength to rip the Carnage sympiote out of her own throat by drawing on her own panic and fear (d10 emotional stress).<br/><br/>There were some things the Watcher was doing during the game that I didn't understand. Now I've had a look at your Hero Cheat Sheet a little more closely, I'd suggest thinking about the following:<br/><br/>- Moving the first two points in 'Adjusting Effect Dice' ('If your total is 5 or more ...' and 'If you step up an Effect die ...') to the Rolling Dice section. I'd put them between Steps 12 and 13.<br/><br/>- In the 'Using Plot Points before you roll' section, I'd move 'Add one of your own stress dice' higher in the list. It's an awesome option that I totally overlooked until the end of the game.<br/><br/>- In the 'Rolling Dice' section, you might want to do something to indicate that Step 11 is a little different to the other steps (as it tells you to repeat the previous 10 steps for your opposition). I was thinking that putting a little circle around the '11' might help distinguish it a bit.<br/><br/>And there one thing in the 'Plot Points before you roll' section that is still unclear to me: what is a trait?

My preference was to keep them part of the list but after the 3rd complaint we moved them. Doesn't mean they need to stay that way but I just wanted to give you some background. I also can release the Cheat Sheets as editable files at some point in case anyone wants to make their own versions. One size doesn't fit all and I'd love to empower as many people as I can.<br/><br/>Edit: I think I've come up with a good compromise!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364947/#Comment_364947" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-03T18:52:59+00:00" title="March  3, 2012  6:52PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, not for the first time, I want to kiss you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364958/#Comment_364958" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-03T19:50:57+00:00" title="March  3, 2012  7:50PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So great....I should doodle my games more.

Aspect of the game, and it made for some really interesting plot twists, but the idea of the characters being whomever the players wanted them to be took a bit of adjustment. It was occasionally a little frustrating to have the tendency for broad comedy drive some of the players to playing cartoon versions of the characters; the dude playing Iron Man in one game played him as the Twisted Toy Faire theater comical drunk Iron Man, for example, and that definitely took some adjustment. I suspect it'll be a good idea if you're going to play this with friends, especially comic readers, to have a frank and open conversation about how much drifting from the source material you're cool with.<br/><br/>The other minor pitfall that I ran into was that because this is a moderately complex game, or at least the dice pool mechanic is not immediately intuitive, the GM really needs to be disciplined about fiction-first play. There was a certain amount of people responding to the villain moves by immediately assembling dice pools, rather than actually saying what they did, then using the resulting action to guide building the dice pool. On one or two occasions, both GMs even caught themselves saying what the villain did, then 'OK, build your defense pool' before even asking what the PCs actually did in response. This is easily dealt with, of course, but I figured it couldn't hurt to mention it because it stood out to me in both games.<br/><br/>But those were really the only potential hiccups I noted. Even with the cacophony of that cave-like space at the Strat, it went really well, I had a great time, and the format, with John staging and tutoring the basic concepts before handing people off to more involved play groups, was a model of best practices that the hobby sorely needs for events like this.<br/><br/>John, the best part of all this is your willingness (eagerness!) to share this stuff to help other people run great events, too. There's way too much reinventing the wheel going on with productions like this, and sharing and perhaps centralizing these practices is a great step forward.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365141/#Comment_365141" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-04T18:33:40+00:00" title="March  4, 2012  6:33PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 4, 2012 6:34PM by jenskot.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Day 2 complete!<br/><br/>We moved from Manhattan to the new 20 Sided Store in Brooklyn and introduced about 21 more people to Marvel! <br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://a2.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/416831_10150841214522782_142918297781_12630139_1310598222_n.jpg" width="600"/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://a8.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/430311_10150841214187782_142918297781_12630133_556789236_n.jpg" width="600"/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://a1.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/425343_10150841214352782_142918297781_12630136_1932874923_n.jpg" width="600"/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://a6.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/430293_10150841214007782_142918297781_12630130_14978032_n.jpg" width="600"/><br/><br/>We had quite a few obstacles to overcome. Local trains weren't working, the store accidentally marked the event on their calendar as private, and there was even less time to promote the event than Saturday's. But none the less we had 3 full games plus more people watching and asking questions. <br/><br/>One player was a co-owner of a comic book store in Queens and commented, "why aren't you guys doing this in comic book stores?" And he's right, we have a lot of famous comic book stores in NYC that would make for incredible locations for Marvel Heroic events. Both gamers and non-gamers commented (paraphrased): <br/><br/>"This game feels like it was made first for comic book fans, second for RPG fans. Games like Mutants &amp; Masterminds feels like an RPG with a superhero theme on top. This is superhero to its core and breaks many expectations. Many RPG fans that play super hero games had some trouble with the game but fans of comics had no problem with it. Yet it's mostly RPG fans that will hear about the game. The people this is great for won't know it exists." <br/><br/>That said, several of the comic book fans were confused why there was no Hulk or Thor (especially with the Avengers movie coming soon). They also laughed at several of the D-list super villains. Although they were really worried when Count Nefaria showed up, where I had no idea how big of a deal he is (even though I've been a comic fan longer than an RPG fan). The comic fans also really liked Blackout as the introductory Event. <br/><br/>The game I ran was wonderful. One person was neither a comic book, nor had they ever played an RPG before (they play Magic the Gathering). The group was split male and female, scewed early 20s. Black Panther asked Storm on a date. Spider-Man had to convince MJ not to go on a photo shoot that would be her big break to stay at home and take care of a sick Aunt May while he tried to stop Carnage. Iron Man formed a new Avengers team and bantered with everyone and anyone. Storm fought her claustrophobia. Shield agents were possessed by Carnage. Ms. Marvel and Black Panther both absorbed d12 energy blasts from Count Nefaria and used them against him! Black Panther used a Watcher Opportunity to build an energy wall Resource to keep any convicts from fleeing. Daredevil was forced to relive horrible memories due to telepathic attack causing him to go berserk and trying to murder an unconscious Carnage. The team had to stop Daredevil before he became the thing he fights against.

We go to a reasonably mixed public school but all the black or brown kids (mixed marriages are actually more common than any other!) in his class are girls and this has been something on our minds as parents. <br/><br/>I am super glad that my marching orders are to make mine Marvel more often! It was incredibly fun just to leaven my usual diet of scrawny, ill-fated murder-hoboes trying to get a ton of copper out of a bloody hole in the ground with all this flying about the Manhattan skyline being invulnerable ultra-celebs.<br/><br/>Best of all was enjoying a RPG alongside my son and having him be the one to school me - "Dad, that's <i>Count Nefaria</i>!!!" and (giving my wife and I our next project) James trying to softshoe past the sexism while showing he knew it was there - "well, one of the heroes couldn't handle the power and flipped out" and my son saying in unison with everyone else "Scarlet Witch" (duh).<br/><br/>I didn't have any conflict with canon lawyers at our table, everyone was really happy to help fill me in even if they weren't nine-year-olds grooving on role reversal. And I was surprised how much comics stuff I turned out to know, or at least be able to project myself into while other people worried about the big picture. At one point James was like "soon we will roll dice" and I said "no need I have a mental movie playing in my head of just how we're getting to the fight scene, the special effects are great I could watch it for hours."<br/><br/>Also the <a href="http://muleabides.wordpress.com/2012/02/29/mighty-marvel-reward-systems/" rel="nofollow">Keys for experience</a> were as tight as James promised. My son and I competed to see who could be the biggest XP-whore. I can't be the particular Iron Man caricature who gave Jim so much pain, because mine was <i>only pretending to be drunk so he could get XP for lying to his teammates about his drinking</i>. Meanwhile Colossus really is getting drunk on Russian beer, my son says, because he wants XP for asserting his heritage.

Even if you can't get the rights for Capcom, you can at least focus on the Marvel characters in those games. <br/><br/>- Play the new <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tY9DnBNJFTI" rel="nofollow">Avengers Trailer</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvVTn2zafyA" rel="nofollow">Marvel vs. Capcom Trailer</a> in the background or before the event starts (almost all of the female players in our games knew Marvel from the movies, not the comics).<br/><br/>- Have the GMs dress up in Cosplay. Or at least I would! A few more months in the gym and I could pull off spandex! (ok, probably not) At Cosplay focused conventions, create some sort of in game reward for players showing off their costumes or using them somehow in the game. <br/><br/>- Redesign the character sheets. Move Milestones to index cards (so you can swap them easily with Event Milestones). Simplify the text and include Graphical Icons so it feels more like a giant Magic the Gathering card. Include character cards for tracking initiative that have the characters picture on them. <br/><br/>- Design a graphical Doom Pool card that tells everyone what the dice can be spent on and includes a warning about what can happen if it reaches 2D12 that everyone on the table can see!<br/><br/>- Include template cards for stress, assets, complications, and resources. The asset for example would say things like, "good for 1 roll" with a check box and additional rules like "spend a plot point and make this last for the whole fight!"<br/><br/>- I would design the intro scenario so I could easily tag in and out new GMs. I already started doing this. I'll run enough to show players how to play and GMs how to run, then have someone co-GM, then promote them to full GM as I go help other people. <br/><br/>- Include random raffle prizes for in game achievements. Spend 10XP to enter your name to win something cool. And scale the prizes based on the number of participants. The more people who unlock this achievement, the better the reward. <br/><br/>- Include take home packages, with most of what you need to run the game, for people to take home with them and cards to point them to online communities where they can learn more, share their experiences, and share any content they make. If printing the material costs too much, include QR codes on all the materials people play with so they can download and print it all themselves. <br/><br/>- 6 different people who had the PDF pointed out that although the rules themselves are perfect for comic book fans, the rules text isn't. Perhaps no rules text is. I would probably rewrite a bunch of the text as well based on usability feedback from 10, 12, and 14 year olds. But Youtube videos might be a better fit, I would be tempted to create a Youtube tutorial people watch before playing. Maybe one that's broken down step by step and you click to move forward or rewatch what you just saw. You could even do this for GMs. Like a youtube video game walkthrough video... do a walk through for Breakout that GMs can watch and get all the basics fast. One of the major reasons (maybe the number one reason) why Magic the Gathering exploded again and is now the <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> selling non-electronic game in the US is because of the virtual Xbox game that taught people how to play Magic so that they can then go and play it in person with their friends. Apps would be expensive but Youtube videos would be a much easier and cheaper first step. <br/><br/>And much more!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365193/#Comment_365193" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-05T04:04:28+00:00" title="March  5, 2012  4:04AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 5, 2012 4:07AM by jenskot.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jim Crocker</cite>Even with the cacophony of that cave-like space at the Strat, it went really well, I had a great time, and the format, with John staging and tutoring the basic concepts before handing people off to more involved play groups, was a model of best practices that the hobby sorely needs for events like this.<br/><br/>John, the best part of all this is your willingness (eagerness!) to share this stuff to help other people run great events, too.

But as I spend more time playing RPGs, I spend more time away from women and non-whites (understandably this isn't the case with RPG everywhere). NerdNYC has a strong female representation, so that's changing quite a bit. Most of my games now are usually 20-50% women. None of this is a problem (for me). I don't spend time thinking my jobs with 70-90% women need more men. But it is interesting how different RPG content attracts different audiences. Sometimes the general RPG experience is much less important than the specific theme. And most people, while they enjoyed the game we played, were not as interested in the rules (still interested but not as interested) and more interested in the social experience. Sharing and reveling in their passions with friends. And since my favorite part of GMing games is experiencing different people, I may need to diversify the kinds of themes I run.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365204/#Comment_365204" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-05T06:41:16+00:00" title="March  5, 2012  6:41AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite> "Why does everyone want to play Black Panther?"<br/></blockquote> The Christopher Priest 1998-2003 run was really well-written with experimental non-sequential story-telling.

Aside from myself, there was Adam, one of the store managers, and three others, two of whom are D&amp;D Encounters people (as well as some of the organizers for GameStorm). Still, I broke out four boxes of cookes, handed out sheets, and we made the best of it. Spidey, Cap, Iron Man and Wolvie all hit the ground running, and made the best of it.<br/><br/>Before-hand, I had printed out several copies of the cheat-sheets from Jenskot, had my action counters, and I even made 4.25x5.5" cards for all the villains, from the Mutate mob to Zzzax, for easy reference.<br/><br/>Altogether, it went very well, and while we were all trying to grok the system in play, we all were able to help each other out quite a bit. I probably should've studied up more on how to play the various villains, as they were defeated fairly easily (except for the villainous mob, which managed to provide quite a bit of challenge initially). I think Carnage ended up being the most dangerous. Part of it, too, was that I wasn't getting enough Doom dice to be able to activate the various Event effects, like being able to re-arm and revitalize the escaped villains, so they were all fairly weak. The players rolled very few 1s, so for the first half of the first Act, I barely had more than 4D6 in my Doom Pool.<br/><br/>Still, we all had fun, and I'm talking with Rainy Day about running monthly Marvel events, once GameStorm is over. I'll probably have to bring along a big ol' box of HeroClix, and maybe some very basic maps, since the one complaint about the Event was that some players (the D&amp;D Encounter people) were having trouble visualizing who was where and where they could go without some visual reference...and I must admit, I kinda like having the visual references as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365218/#Comment_365218" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-05T08:05:14+00:00" title="March  5, 2012  8:05AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>- I would design the intro scenario so I could easily tag in and out new GMs. I already started doing this.

These are a little more visual and stripped back from the official versions. Warning: my layout skills are atrocious and this was done on Word <br/><br/>The idea is to have the players be able to place a dice on each speech bubble, gather them in the centre as the dice pool, roll them and then allocate them to Total and Effect to the left and right. I have also placed Plot Points and Resources next to the related Trait and tried to match the shape of the prop I am using. Plot points are circular poker chips and Resources are recorded on square post-it notes.<br/><br/>There are three significant changes that I have made from the RAW:<br/><br/>1. I have removed Limits and these will be a Watcher driven only. I want the players to focus on Distinctions as their source of PP.<br/>2. Milestones have been replaced by a single line, much like a Belief. I will award the players XP based on Milestones as normal, but think that the single statement will be easier for them to process to start.<br/>3. I have preselected certain parts of the SFX to make them faster to use, as I can include the modified dice to be used instead of a modifer.<br/><br/>Captain America: <a href="http://db.tt/yJoa9jZg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://db.tt/yJoa9jZg</a><br/>Iron-Man: <a href="http://db.tt/5Wohr2YS" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://db.tt/5Wohr2YS</a> <br/>Luke Cage: <a href="http://db.tt/k5iB6RIO" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://db.tt/k5iB6RIO</a> <br/>Ms Marvel: <a href="http://db.tt/YvtuDXmH" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://db.tt/YvtuDXmH</a> <br/>Shadowcat: <a href="http://db.tt/7JxTpi4B" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://db.tt/7JxTpi4B</a> <br/>Spider-Man: <a href="http://db.tt/Niozt5oq" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://db.tt/Niozt5oq</a> <br/>Spider-Woman: <a href="http://db.tt/TJP0xhzS" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://db.tt/TJP0xhzS</a> <br/><br/>Any comments or feedback welcome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365339/#Comment_365339" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-05T14:28:10+00:00" title="March  5, 2012  2:28PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool concept, Luke!<br/><br/>How does one keep track of the different kinds of stress on your sheet?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker" title="Skywalker"><img alt="Skywalker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker">Skywalker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365343/#Comment_365343" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-05T14:33:19+00:00" title="March  5, 2012  2:33PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have three coloured paper clips matching the colour of the words.

I could see redesigning the character sheet with speech bubbles next to each Trait Box indicating "pick one trait from this box and put it here".

Some reviews tend to be the bad kind of marketing, press releases in the guise of reviews or they tend to be uninformed reviews, opinion without actual play. There is none of that here. It makes it clear who may not or may like the game and why. The review is based on actual play with a wide assortment of people.<br/><br/>But to be fair (and to add context), many of the players involved were hardcore Marvel FASERIP, Champions, Mutants &amp; Masterminds, and OSR enthusiasts. But most are also die hard comic book fans. The review also starts off with talk about Iron Man pretending to be drunk and Colossus being wasted. Clearly this is going to influence the rest of the game (although again to be fair, given Iron Man's Milestones, we heard of several games that included these type of scenes). But this was only 1 out of 3 games James ran that day. The other games didn't have this kind of content. Also to be fair, these are 1 shots and some of these games are with strangers. And some of the problems pointed out (confusing terminology) are also problems James and crew feel other superhero RPGs also have. That all said, I think James has some very useful insights.<br/><br/>It's also worth reading some of the comments below the review. Especially from Jon Hastings and Barking Alien.<br/><br/>Full disclosure: James is also a friend so I'm biased when recommending his review.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker" title="Skywalker"><img alt="Skywalker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker">Skywalker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365557/#Comment_365557" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-06T14:45:32+00:00" title="March  6, 2012  2:45PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have added some colour to the sheets.

I have this feedback because I have been reading them over and over again as part of my prep! You rock.<br/><br/>On the <b>Hero Cheat Sheet</b> and the <b>Watcher Cheat Sheet</b>, under USING EFFECT DICE, the second item reads: <br/><br/>"Step up or down a trait (except trauma). If stress or complications exceeds D12, target can take actions till recovered."<br/><br/>I assume this should read, "...target can take <i>no</i> actions till recovered"? (And, really, it's "until recovered"; a "till" is where you put money.)<br/><br/>Under EARNING PLOT POINTS on both sheets, item four reads: <br/><br/>"Watcher may reward you if you roleplay being stressed out."<br/><br/>I couldn't find this in the rules. Any idea what page this is on?<br/><br/>On the <b>Watcher Cheat Sheet</b>, under Growing the Doom Pool, the second item reads:<br/><br/>"f the player rolls multiple opportunities, do the above multiple times or give the player 1 PP and step up a D4 for every opportunity rolled, and then add it to the doom pool."<br/><br/>I believe this is incorrect. According to OM15, the die added to the Doom Pool always begins at D6.<br/><br/>Lastly, just some general feedback about the <b>Watcher Cheat Sheet</b>:<br/><br/>1. I think it would be even cooler if the Watcher sheet didn't repeat all of the player-centric material from the Hero sheet, e.g., spending and earning Plot Points, a villain data file sample instead of a hero sample, anything about XP other than how often the triggers can be hit, and so on. I like the idea of it being solely focused on what the Watcher needs to know in order to do their job. They can always have the Hero sheet handy.<br/><br/>2. I love the page references! But, I think if you're referencing the same page, it's better to say "See Below" instead of "See p1", since the reader is already on page 1.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367705/#Comment_367705" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T18:55:18+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  6:55PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Mark!

It would be too easy to extend out combat and make even small fights a pain. This ties into the fact that Watcher characters recover in Transition as is needed by the story rather than the PCs process. If they could also spread around Stress then it would create a bias in their favour.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller" title="jjafuller"><img alt="jjafuller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller">jjafuller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367822/#Comment_367822" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-15T06:56:57+00:00" title="March 15, 2012  6:56AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cam, could we get a style guide to use for fan created materials?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367824/#Comment_367824" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-15T06:59:55+00:00" title="March 15, 2012  6:59AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: CamBanks</cite>Note that the correct terminology is step up, step back.
