It rapidly developed into something else. Something wierd. I kept going with it, because it demanded that I do so. In the end I had a game that did some of what I expected it to, and much of what I never even saw coming. Anyway, I have the first beta document ready for consumption, and I would like to share it with all of you here on rpg.net. I would love to hear your thoughts on this hack(is that even the right word for it anymore?). I am particularly interested in whether it is even understandable. You will need a copy of Fate Core to actually use the document.<br/><br/><a href="http://walkninginshadows.blogspot.com/2013/03/i-finishedsort-of-first-pdf-version-of.html" rel="nofollow">Magi V001</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407931/#Comment_407931" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-04T03:20:54+00:00" title="March  4, 2013  3:20AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 4, 2013 7:28AM by catty_big.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wrong house mate, RPGnet is two doors down. Watch out for their dog though, it's a bit aggressive. Seriously, your game looks interesting; I'll give it a longer peruse when I've got some breathing space. There's a guy at my club who plays a lot of White Wolf stuff like Mage: the Blah, not sure how he feels about FATE, but I'll point it in his direction anyway. Good luck with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
