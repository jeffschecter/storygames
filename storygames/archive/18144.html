The Forgean concept of Creative Agenda says that your game(s) must be focused on a creative goal, and all the parts should be fine-tuned to work towards that goal.<br/><br/>2. D&amp;D, until recently, has not been a game which supported a unified Creative Agenda very well. (Although it clearly worked for some people, and had tremendous commercial success in the RPG market.)<br/><br/>3. With 4th Edition D&amp;D, the designers of the game were influenced by Forge concepts and tried to design the fourth Edition to be a focused, coherent game.<br/><br/>4. Due to this decision, D&amp;D 4E was less successful: the game could no longer do everything its fans wanted it to do. Lots of people gravitated back to older editions, Pathfinder, etc, and many dropped 4th Edition altogether.</blockquote>\nWhat do you think? Is there a grain of truth here? (Almost all of the points above are pretty controversial, after all.)<br/><br/>No matter what you think about the validity of this argument, what lessons do you think we can we take away from this story?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409714/#Comment_409714" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-20T09:49:30+00:00" title="March 20, 2013  9:49AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whenever the makers of D&amp;D decided to focus the game in a new direction for 4E, I'd bet the decision was made based on audience concerns -- getting new fans, hitting the sweet spot of certain older fans, making something genuinely new that's more worth buying than a few subtle tweaks -- and not at all based on what Ron Edwards thinks makes for good roleplaying.<br/><br/>If the Forge concept of focused gaming happened to dovetail with what the D&amp;D folks wanted to do, cool.  If Forge stuff gave them some design ideas, cool.  If they blindly obeyed a shallow reading of Forge principles, then that's not cool, but I'm inclined to think more highly of the makers of D&amp;D than that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409718/#Comment_409718" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-20T09:53:07+00:00" title="March 20, 2013  9:53AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shrug, I dunno. <br/><br/>D&amp;D 4E as an experiment kinda failed, I guess. I admit I started tuning out (after actively playing it) when I saw the "essentials" line, which made the waters muddy and confusing. I have no idea what the thought was behind those.<br/><br/>Combat in 4E was fun as hell, with really exciting power combos and actual focus on strategy, positioning, and terrain. But over and over again we would come to the end of a 4-hour session that had 2-3 skirmishes or so, and say, "Aw, crap! We forgot to roleplay! Again!"<br/><br/>Out of 4E's shadow came two things that I've been super-interested in, though.<br/>* Pathfinder: Their supplements and accessories are pretty rad. I love the cardboard minis lines they have, I use them for all sorts of games (including Savage Worlds)<br/>* 13th Age: It's the combat of 4th Edition, slimmed down (so less tactics on the map, but more tactics in your power combos) to the point where you don't forget to roleplay. Played it, what, about 10 times now. I went into a moratorium until the final book-version of the game is released, but it's the version of D&amp;D I've been most excited to play since 2e and the buzz around 3e.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409732/#Comment_409732" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-20T10:38:04+00:00" title="March 20, 2013 10:38AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Written for Forge Twunts because this is a Forge Twunt thread.

D&amp;D has been successful up through 3.5 because it is murky and basically requires people to house rule it to make it work for them. Feature or bug? 4e came along and laser-focused the game on Step On Up play and anyone who wanted to do Right to Dream play was left out in the cold. That was basically 80% of the D&amp;D market. <br/><br/>Game design success.<br/>Game marketing failure.<br/><br/>Along comes D&amp;D Next, whose primary overarching goal is to make everyone happy again, but under the umbrella of coherent rules. I think it's an "El Dorado"-like game design and likely to fail in that arena.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409733/#Comment_409733" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-20T10:38:27+00:00" title="March 20, 2013 10:38AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 20, 2013 10:41AM by komradebob.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Any big attempt to narrow the focus of D&amp;D is likely to have some small feel of disaster to it, if only because D&amp;D is all things to all people all the time.<br/><br/>At the heart of the problem is simply this: D&amp;D is an invitation and excuse to Play Pretend with a bunch of pals, when you're over the age of ten years old.

So I am sure the influence was felt. At least for Magic the Gathering they have people who are rather on top of game design ideas and theories, so I assume at least some of that can be found in their D&amp;D branch as well. Or maybe they tried to implement it with 4th Ed.<br/><br/>I think the creative agenda of the middle editions of D&amp;D from 2nd upwards till 4th was to play Dungeons &amp; Dragons which has become a genre of it's own. With it's own assumptions about how it should work and how mechanics should be working. There also is a strong narrative about how the group and play should work, away from the actual game. Pathfinders goal very much is to conserve that D&amp;D feeling and genre as is much of the Old School scene.<br/>There undeniably was a change of focus in 4th edition, towards combat and towards "balance" or at least screentime / spotlight balance with a similar width of abilities for each character type. There were influences from boardgaming, tabletops and computer rpgs as well i am sure and as I theorized in the beginning probably some from the trading card genre. Which violated the narrative of the D&amp;D gameplay for many fans and thus alienated them.<br/>Speaking of computer games, to me D&amp;D4 sometimes felt like one of the older RPG where you explore a map or landscape and then suddenly it changes into the different, turnbased, perspective of the combat screen.<br/><br/>About Andy's point of forgetting to roleplay. I noticed that too, there is not much support ruleswise for anything between combats and usually you just have to freeform and handwave it or if that is more the groups style railroad towards the next encounter. I think the core of the system is about combat and you can whatever you want in between. Nobody would stop you from splitting it into a Mouseguard like GM and Player turn. Where the GM turn is about a quest and combat, taking 2/3 or so of the session and the player turn is doing whatever they want to do with their characters in whatever world. Or using some system like Archipelago to guide the narrative between combats and putting one player in charge of Encounters as his aspect who then has to put them on the battlemap and provide stats. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/>I would even say you would still be playing 4th Ed if you do it that way, because of how much the whole thing is focussed on combat. You would not be playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons the genre however, because that has a narrative about the structure of playgroups and sessions as well. If that means that 4th Ed is not genre D&amp;D or just that it can be something else, I don't know...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409735/#Comment_409735" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-20T10:52:42+00:00" title="March 20, 2013 10:52AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            4E was apparently not successful enough to satisfy the demands of the publisher of <i>Magic: The Gathering</i> (though it was still successful enough that the vast majority of RPG publishers wouln't even be able to cope), but I think a big chunk of where it fell flat was in things unrelated to the actual game design per se. It had terrible PR and marketing, was in the unique position of having a major competitor publishing the prior edition, it had a lot of hysterical and factually deficient critics (like every other new edition of D&amp;D), and the designers were slow and awkward in addressing its legitimate flaws. Given all of that, I really have no idea how much creative agenda type issues affected it, because I can't possibly separate it from all the other problems it experienced.\n<blockquote>No matter what you think about the validity of this argument, what lessons do you think we can we take away from this story?</blockquote>\nCommunicate as clearly and honestly with your fans as possible.<br/><br/>For example, switching the Character Builder to a web-based Silverlight app wasn't an awesome idea, but they managed to make it soooo much worse by totally clamming up about the status of the CB for months, and then launching it when it was buggy and barely functional. Essentials had its good points, but there was no clear marketing message about what the heck it was supposed to even be.

It is very much focused around the depth of the mini combat and the action around it. Because it was so focused, it drew a lot of critics and alienated a lot of people. I feel like the argument that there isn't roleplay in 4th is a little odd, in so much as though there is little rules support for it (Beyond some very gorgeous setting background in their 'Points of Light' idea which I think was pretty neat and the 'Playing a...' sections that exist in the various Power supplements. Roleplaying support for PCs in a supplement is not really the most encouraging sign.) but there really needn't be. I think 4th assumes that players will take inspiration from what little they have and run with it in a very freeform way, and there was, to an extent, I feel, a constraint on RP in previous editions in how much roleplay was rules-mediated.<br/><br/>Overall, of course, these things depend entirely on personal taste.<br/>Essentials was when the real money problems started occuring, from what I can gather, and I feel this was probably due to the result of muddied the design water. In seeing lost members to Pathfinder, rather than sticking behind their game design vision, they tried to bring them back with a new spin on old school (The Essentials martial classes, for examples, which rely on at will abilities, have much less tactical depth than their Player Handbook cousins) and rebooting the core.<br/>The result was, really, that they lost more players, as the folks who were playing 4th ed and enjoying it for the tactics didn't like the new classes, the folks who loved the balancing of it compared to previous editions were put off by the seeming imbalance that existed among the Essentials classes (Numerically no, but in diversity yes) and the target audience of players who were playing Pathfinder were happier playing Pathfinder, and all the more power to them.<br/><br/>Whether 4th ed had Forge influences, I dunno. Nor whether D&amp;D is its own genre (It seems to me to just be a toolkit to run kitchen sink high fantasy, adding and omitting weirdness to taste). What I can say is that the design goal likely alienated people, and the change in goal alienated further.

The ideas were great! I was really excited by reading it! But it fell down in play. That's certainly not something you can blame on focused design or the Forge.

I'm really enjoying reading your reactions to this! (And, so far, I think I agree with pretty much all of what's being said, if anyone is curious about that at all.)<br/><br/><br/>As a point of clarification:<br/><br/>What's the deal with the Forge, and Creative Agenda, and design priorities?<br/><br/>It comes in two flavours I've seen, both rather extremist:<br/><br/>1. "I like the Forge! I like new games! I'm really excited that the new D&amp;D looks more like a 'focused' game! Those designers have learned things from the Forge, and this is a step forward from 'incoherent' D&amp;D! Finally, a good game, thanks to the Forge. This proves that Forge-ite ideas have value!"<br/><br/>This was a popular opinion a few years back, when D&amp;D4E was coming out. I don't hear it a whole lot anymore, and haven't for a while.<br/><br/>2. "I don't like the Forge or the new games. D&amp;D4E was more 'focused' along what I think are Forge-ist lines, and that is a big mistake. The game is a total flop precisely because it attempts to follow Forge-ish ideas. Because those designers bought into Ron Edwards' dogma, the game is terrible, and doesn't sell well. A terrible, terrible game, thanks to the Forge, which ruins roleplaying. This proves that Forge-ite ideas are horrible!"<br/><br/>I don't know how old this second idea is, but it definitely exists today in certain circles (I've heard it several times recently).<br/><br/>I find the attempt to equate Forge concepts with the financial success or failure of D&amp;D4E very interesting! I have no idea whether there's any truth to that (on either side) or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409781/#Comment_409781" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-20T14:31:15+00:00" title="March 20, 2013  2:31PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 20, 2013 2:31PM by Paul_T.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>4e came along and laser-focused the game on Step On Up play and anyone who wanted to do Right to Dream play was left out in the cold.

They started to be true to what the game was about.<br/><br/>I'm actually fascinated by D&amp;D4. There are pages dedicated to what you do in a roleplaying game but they kind of drowned by other information. Just compare to WFRPG 3 that is as heavily combat focused as D&amp;D4, but they break it off by structuring up the session with combat mode and story mode. If you write a game like D&amp;D4 and say "combat, combat, roleplay, combat, combat, combat, combat", people think "combat". I wish more games could be better at planting thoughts like that.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409809/#Comment_409809" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-20T17:29:15+00:00" title="March 20, 2013  5:29PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WFRPG 3 is even more boardgamey than 4th Ed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409815/#Comment_409815" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-20T17:58:44+00:00" title="March 20, 2013  5:58PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>As a point of clarification:<br/><br/>What's the deal with the Forge, and Creative Agenda, and design priorities?<br/><br/>It comes in two flavours I've seen, both rather extremist:<br/><br/>1. "I like the Forge! I like new games! I'm really excited that the new D&amp;D looks more like a 'focused' game! Those designers have learned things from the Forge, and this is a step forward from 'incoherent' D&amp;D! Finally, a good game, thanks to the Forge. This proves that Forge-ite ideas have value!"<br/><br/>This was a popular opinion a few years back, when D&amp;D4E was coming out. I don't hear it a whole lot anymore, and haven't for a while.<br/><br/>2. "I don't like the Forge or the new games. D&amp;D4E was more 'focused' along what I think are Forge-ist lines, and that is a big mistake. The game is a total flop precisely because it attempts to follow Forge-ish ideas. Because those designers bought into Ron Edwards' dogma, the game is terrible, and doesn't sell well. A terrible, terrible game, thanks to the Forge, which ruins roleplaying. This proves that Forge-ite ideas are horrible!"<br/><br/>I don't know how old this second idea is, but it definitely exists today in certain circles (I've heard it several times recently).<br/><br/>I find the attempt to equate Forge concepts with the financial success or failure of D&amp;D4E very interesting! I have no idea whether there's any truth to that (on either side) or not.</blockquote>\nI don't doubt that there were some people saying <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, but having wasted entirely too much time following 4e-related forum threads in recent years, to me it seems like that sentiment was nonetheless vanishingly rare. As for <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, it's the product of a very shrill fringe group that doesn't seem to grasp that it's 2013. In the present day Ron is off doing his own thing, no one really talks about GNS except the people who are really angry at the Forge as it was nearly a decade ago, and on Story Games old-school D&amp;D gets discussed quite a bit (certainly more than GNS or, say, Spione). Hell, the last time I saw something from Ron it was a podcast where he was praising the OSR. In my view GNS theory and its ilk helped foster some unique and innovative games, but for the most part everyone's outgrown it except for its haters.<br/><br/>Thinking about it more, I would say that 4E was also very much a follow-up to 3.5. Although Mearls and company do play other games, they work on D&amp;D professionally and communicate first and foremost with D&amp;D fans. A few years of fans' determined character optimization put the worst of 3.5's balance issues right in the designers' faces, and although other things definitely played a role, I think it's hard to overestimate the influence of 3.5 and its fanbase on what they attempted with 4e. Where they did look elsewhere, it seems like they ultimately did so in service of the goal of fixing perceived problems with 3.5. You wouldn't think it from the way some Pathfinder fans talk about it, but 4e has an awful lot of 3.5's DNA, and it absolutely would not have turned out the same way if it hadn't been made by experienced d20 designers.<br/><br/>One of the unique things about D&amp;D, and one of the reasons that in many ways I'm glad to not be working on it, is that I don't think any other game of any kind has been so many different things to so many different people. It launched as a barely complete game for which houseruling was basically required, and including basic and advanced there have been around a dozen different official versions, in addition to countless hacks, imitators, tributes, and retroclones. In light of that, narrowing the game's focus may have been a mistake, but something a lot more basic than what theory they might've been listening to.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I think that it wasn't so much that 4e was too narrow in focus as that the non-combat elements were simply among the more underdeveloped elements of the game. A hypothetical 4.5 could develop Skill Challenges into what they should've been, make rituals more appealing and effective to use, make Utility Powers more plentiful and more non-combat oriented, hugely streamlined combat, made it easier for every class to have non-combat merits (instead of screwing the fighter over for skills), and any number of other things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409842/#Comment_409842" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-20T21:25:25+00:00" title="March 20, 2013  9:25PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, so, like, 4E isn't so much a Step On Up focused RPG as *not an RPG at all*.

Between RPG and not-RPG.<br/><br/>Bear in mind, I'm not saying "4E isn't an RPG" as some sort of tribalistic trashing of something outside my comfort zone. I <i>like</i> 4E. My contention is a formal, definitional statement. Or, to put it another way, I'm arguing that if 4E *is* an RPG, then so are the 4E boardgames, and also games like Descent. I guess I'm okay with that, but it seems kind of weird.<br/><br/>And, yeah, what frozenwastes said is correct. Excluding 4E from the category "RPGs" does not exclude 3E and earlier editions.<br/><br/>Here's a major, really important thing I forgot: Skills. Look at how DCs are determined in 3E versus 4E. In 4E, RAW, there's literally no referent to the fiction, at all. A lock that is DC 15 to pick at 1st level will be DC 32 or whatever at 13th level, with no change at all in the fiction. That's not just box-to-box, it's like an... <i>anti-arrow</i> or something\u2014it actively breaks the sense that things happen in the gameworld for an in-world reason.<br/><br/>Edit: saying, "We played an RPG, and forgot to roleplay," is like saying, "We played basketball, but forgot to shoot any baskets."<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409945/#Comment_409945" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-21T11:40:32+00:00" title="March 21, 2013 11:40AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 21, 2013 11:41AM by Andy.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> It even references what Deliverator indicates.

The two things that were highlighted were powers-on-the-fly, created to plug in character actions that didn't fit neatly into the rules and heavy use of skill challenges that were heavily improvisational and using a different set of difficulty numbers (seemed like the numbers in the book were an after thought). The game he was describing then, in retrospect, sounds a lot like what people talk about doing with the *world games. I wish I could remember who posted that but it was years ago.<br/><br/>This came after failing to find the fun in 4e with my home group... after the fact. While playing, everyone was having fun, but it lacked the illusion of storytelling or some such from previous editions. I really wanted to come back to the game with power-on-the-fly and interactive skill challenges, but wasn't skilled enough with the system to implement them well, if only they had gotten the text to support that kind of play into the original DMG, I think people would have embraced the game on a much deeper level.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409960/#Comment_409960" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-21T12:49:28+00:00" title="March 21, 2013 12:49PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The description and instructions for the GM role are what makes it different from a Board Game. Also the Relevance of purely descriptice factors outside the battlemap for the combat part links the roleplaying and the boardgaming part, even if you completely metagame the combat (which would inculde the GM playing to win and not playing to challenge). The biggest example would be Daily Powers with the passage of days in the hands of the players in the rp part of the game. So there are mechanical links to the roleplaying that also is (not very well) explained by the core book.<br/>\n<blockquote>I don't know about "not an RPG at all", but it gets at something I was thinking about in response to the OSR comment by Paul above.  I don't think 4E is really Step On Up, because the challenging gamey part of 4E is pure board game.  Sure, the rest of the game may give context, but combat is constrained by the options presented to you by the rules.  Whereas the challenge in OSR play is mostly un-mechanized in-fiction stuff.  The opposite of 4E in a way.</blockquote>\nWhich I think fits with my idea of reclaiming D&amp;D as a genre / ideal being the goal of both Pathfinder and the OSR.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark" title="Captain_Thark"><img alt="Captain_Thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/674/nQDB5F77NZR8N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">Captain_Thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409961/#Comment_409961" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-21T12:56:00+00:00" title="March 21, 2013 12:56PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's try an experiment.

Yes, in the middle of combat, we ceased describing things and focused strictly on the mechanical. However, outside of combat, my group took on personal quests, got letters from NPCs, owned and operated a farm-turn-outpost, had relationships with NPCs, had back-stories that came into play, the whole nine yards.<br/><br/>Granted, a lot of that came from tradition imported from other games, but not entirely. There was quite a bit of non-combat content that came straight out of the books and the adventure modules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409972/#Comment_409972" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-21T14:06:59+00:00" title="March 21, 2013  2:06PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            4e has a very clear way of making the fiction matter: DMG page 42 (stunts).

They almost never used the word roleplay. They just used the word role. And role consistently means "the job you fill in team-based tactical combat". They clearly define the roles that the system supports - striker, defender, leader (which should probably have been called buffer), controller.<br/><br/>They use the word role to mean that thing very very consistently. They do not use role to mean character. They do not use role to mean a meta group level thing, like caller or GM. They do not use role to mean something social, like the host. They only use it to mean a classification of the type of tactical things a given class build is good at.<br/><br/>They tell you lots of things about roles. They tell you which 2 roles each class is designed to be good at. They tell you which of the powers are more suited to which of those roles. They tell you that the game works best when you have exactly 4 players, each one built to a different role. They tell you that you that you will have the most success as a team when each of you fulfills your determined role successfully.<br/><br/>And in doing all that, I think they subtly introduce a different definition of roleplay. They do this by repeatedly and consistently defining the "role" part of roleplay.<br/><br/>In 4e, roleplay does NOT primarily mean the portrayal of a character other than the self (though, of course, informed by the self), as it does in most other contexts - in most other RPG games and in general English language use.<br/><br/>In 4e, roleplay means playing your role. It means fulfilling your responsibilities in combat as a striker, defender, leader, or controller.<br/><br/>Has anyone else noticed this?<br/><br/>(In case it's not clear, this is me engaging only with the text, not with the players and the culture of play.

Having detailed tactical combat rules doesn't contradict roleplaying, although it definitely makes it less prominent.<br/><br/>Look at Steve Jackson's "The Fantasy Trip", circa 1980 \u2014 he started from his simple tactical fantasy combat games Melee and Wizard, extended the mechanics, and added enough surrounding scope (like non-combat skills) to handle the stuff that happens between fights. The roleplaying part was understood \u2014 we didn't need plot points or Goals or Aspects to tell us to treat our characters like they were people not minis. Same thing goes for the way my group played OD&amp;D and AD&amp;D1 at around the same time.<br/><br/>Maybe there is something very weird about 4e that I haven't recognized not having played it. I read the rules and it looks to me like a typical fantasy-heartbreaker style RPG. It's driven by combat not interpersonal drama, but that's true of the way most people play RPGs, I think. Do people really play 4e such that "everything not compulsory is forbidden", i.e. you can't improvise an action there isn't a written-down rule for? That would be nuts. And if they do, why?

It could upset the carefully constructed mechanical balance.  Hell I couldn't even see where the RPing happened in 3.5, which I have at least read; at that point, you can say you RP as well as use the rules, but then you could do that with any set of props.  The system, it seemed to me, neither required or encouraged RP, and so it all seemed rather pointless.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Fleming" title="James_Fleming"><img alt="James_Fleming" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Fleming">James_Fleming</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410007/#Comment_410007" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-21T18:35:34+00:00" title="March 21, 2013  6:35PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno, I always quite liked that within 4e, your RP/personal stuff was purely mediated within the realm of imagined space and not at all by the book. If we take the example of the 2E fighter getting a castle at level x, compared to the 4e fighter who might get the aforementioned castle when the plot accomodates/rewards him with it, I think if anything that becomes more of an RPG.<br/>The DC chart often gets a lot of flak, but it isn't saying what many think it is. It gives appropriate DC challenges per level. If the lock should be a challenge for a level 3 party but a level 6 rogue is picking it, then it will open easy enough. If anything, this mathematical analysis is part of what makes building encounters and challenges in 4th so darn easy.<br/>There were a few things I houseruled in. Custom 'Scene encounter powers' encouraged players to interact with the environment rather than just using what was on their sheet, which honestly is a problem I have seen with many editions of D&amp;D (The 'why do I attack him with my feet by swinging off the chandelier to push him into the fire when I could just hit him with my sword for more damage' problem) but honestly 4th has the most elegant work around if that- if it had been only mentioned in the books.<br/>I found the whole combat roles thing to be really useful in helping new players decide what they wanted to play. Often they'd come with a character background concept and a 'thing they wanted to be able to do'. From that, you can really easily assign classes, although sometimes they mightn't be what you'd expect... ("I wanna be a big hitting bruiser guy, should I play a fighter?" is probably better answered by "Check out the Barbarian if you want to hit the hardest, and you can take some daily powers that aren't so magical too! You could do this this and this with the fighter if you wanted to make that same character though.")<br/>And yeah, a lot of those 'Things I wanna be able to do' were combat-specific, but that is because D&amp;D has always been a game about dungeons... and dragons. The thing that is most rewarding about 4th in comparison to previous editions is that when those two D and D bits enter the fray, some players aren't left feeling useless or upstaged(See quadratic wizards or useless bards). 4th ed is all about equality of contribution, and whilst all the classes operate very differently despite the shared structure inside of combat, out of combat everybody has a niche they can fill also, but it is one largely unmandated by combat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_410013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/contracycle" title="contracycle (Banned)"><img alt="contracycle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/contracycle">contracycle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410013/#Comment_410013" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-21T19:35:55+00:00" title="March 21, 2013  7:35PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, IF the plot accomodates/rewards you with it, the point is that the old rule PROMPTED the event.

There's a generic table for opening locks that says the DC is 20 at Heroic tier, 30 at Paragon tier, and 35 at Epic tier. When I read it, it was obvious to me that the DCs were for typical locks one might encounter in those tiers, but that's me.<br/><br/>Every single other skill DC table in that section contains values that change only if the thing being targeted changes. E.g., it's always DC 20 to hear whispers when using the Perception skill. It's always DC 15 to find tracks in soft ground, with variables depending on the size of the creature, but not the level of the character using the skill. You can assume that lock picking is an exception to this, but I'm not sure why you would.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410047/#Comment_410047" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-22T02:01:07+00:00" title="March 22, 2013  2:01AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Pages 6-10 and 23-24 in PHB 1 goes through how you play a character other than yourself, but like I said earlier in this thread - it just drowns in the other information. 7 pages in a book of 320 pages isn't much to talk about.</blockquote>\nI don't have it handy to check, but does it actually use the word roleplay to describe that activity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>This is the world of the DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS\xae<br/>Roleplaying Game (also referred to as D&amp;D), the<br/>pinnacle of fantasy roleplaying games.

A huge section in DMG that's about combat and encounter is a third one.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the paragraph that I quoted above has the word "roleplaying game" and they repeat those words all through the text.

I think his point about the cues referring to cues (the boxes) was very valuable but it got lost in the reaction to his conclusion.  Even to the point where people who had no idea what he was saying when talking about it in boxes, arrows and clouds terms, had to chime in, even though they couldn't address the actual content of the post except for his conclusion.<br/><br/>To get back on topic, I've seen a ton of discussions on places like Enworld where people have teased out what they didn't like about 4E and it largely maps to what Deliverator was talking about.  Decision making divorced from the fiction.  3.x has similar issues, but not to the same degree.  Also people played 3.x in a variety of ways and 4E doesn't support all those sub modes of play.  Combine that with Wizard's bungling of the marketing of the new edition and you have large swaths of the customer base that feel that Wizards fired them as customers.  Paizo saw the need to keep the rules system that they were publishing their adventures for in print and Pathfinder was born.  With its high production values and appearing at precisely the right time, it's taken the top spot for D&amp;D in terms of sales through distribution.  Even though at it's core, it is a D&amp;D.<br/><br/>So I guess I do agree that the overly focused design of 4E contributed a small amount to the commercial failure of D&amp;D in terms of losing the top spot in terms of sales through distribution, I think the larger causes were the alienation of the customer base through their marketing and the OGL ensuring that those who were happy with 3.x could continue with it indefinitely with new printed material.  With the premier example of this being the Pathfinder product line.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410096/#Comment_410096" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-22T10:01:58+00:00" title="March 22, 2013 10:01AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So I agree, but not in the extreme way that you tried to point out.</blockquote>\nSounds good.

Is it that simple?<br/><br/>After all, the entire OSR movement consists of people who are largely into Step on Up play (as far as I can tell, anyway), but they really don't like D&amp;D4E. (In fact, some people think the OSR exists largely *because* of D&amp;D4E, which "forced" all those gamers to turn to earlier editions.

Theory is meant to build stepladders, not to cobble together makeshift barricades declaring that the sacred ground of "RPG" is off-limits to one game or another.<br/><br/>Don't take it so seriously. RPGs are not under attack by 4th Edition. We're all on the same side here, so there's nothing to get upset about.

You have dialogue, exploration and encounter (I think those were the modes outlined in the DM book).  And encounter is a defined period of time in terms of the refresh cycle and level pacing.  10 encounters should give you enough XP to level and when you start or end an encounter, you are interacting with the beginning and end of a time spent in a given game mode.<br/><br/>Pathfinder/3.x not having that resource refresh period of "encounter" means you can do variable (in terms of XP budget/CR) encounters a lot more easily.  You can also spend more time in exploration mode and make the transition to combat more far, far less jarring as you are not entering and exiting a unit of game time called an "encounter."  It's easier to stay in the "I describe the fictional situation, you describe what your character's do, then we use the system to resolve it" mode.  <br/><br/>You end up making decisions based on the described fictional situation more in 3.x/PF than in 4E, where you are more likely to make decisions based on game mechanics.  However, it is more than possible to play 3.x/PF in the exact same way as 4E and have player decision making to be based on the game mechanics rather than the described situation.  4E really supports that approach better though.  3.x has things like spells that describe what happens in the fiction rather than in terms of squares, conditions, the economy of actions, encounter durations, etc., for example.<br/><br/>All this said, 3.x was the D&amp;D that made me take a multi-year hiatus from D&amp;D while 4E brought me back in.  I just tired of 4E and went back to 3.x/Pathfinder after a few years of playing 4E weekly.  After about 6 months of weekly 3.x/Pathfinder, I went back to BECMI, Swords &amp; Wizardry, Mini-6 and OpenQuest for my trad gaming fix.  They have even more support for the circuit of description procedure of play than 3.x/Pathfinder does (which in turn has more support for it than 4E).<br/><br/>If you are looking for play in which the players decide what their character's do based on the described fictional situation, both 3.x/PF and 4E are pretty poor choices, but 3.x will support it better than 4E, which has support for its game modes so well built that it can get in the way of responding to the described fiction, even to the point of making in nonsensical to do so.  Or, at the very least, very sub-optimal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410201/#Comment_410201" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-23T03:23:31+00:00" title="March 23, 2013  3:23AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You can also spend more time in exploration mode and make the transition to combat more far, far less jarring as you are not entering and exiting a unit of game time called an "encounter."</blockquote>\nI don't find this true. 'Roll for intitiative' has always marked the (slightly jarring) start to a combat situation, whether you want to call it an encounter or not. And for non-combat encounters, when we've played we've always felt able to use our discretion as to when the encounter started or not (often restrospectively) on the few occasions that it's mattered. I don't think the rules advocate doing some big stop to all discussion and saying 'this is now an encounter' or what have you. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410202/#Comment_410202" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-23T03:32:42+00:00" title="March 23, 2013  3:32AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The difference between 3e and 4e is one of clarity and success. The text of 3e makes all kinds of allusions about how to play it but the game mechanics when played as written produce a complex, gamist, slightly-disconnected-from-the-fiction tactical challenges and set pieces. But it's broken as fuck and the right choices mechanically can often be quite jarring in terms of the fiction.<br/><br/>4e takes the game that 3e's mechanics were trying to achieve and succeeds at it. The text is much clearer, the tactics and so on are much more interesting, the combat is more fun, and the different choices are infinitely more balanced against one another. <br/><br/>The clarity is the problem. Writing a text that successfully communicates the intended playstyle also successfully communicates that other playstyles are not quite suited. Meaning that people feel more reluctant to drift the game by ignoring/changing great swathes of the mechanics to suit their own playstyle and even the assumed overall intent of the designers ('this must be what they meant'). I think that most of the people who like 3e but hate 4e are those who play 3e but in a heavily drifted approximation of 2e kind of way.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410207/#Comment_410207" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-23T08:07:09+00:00" title="March 23, 2013  8:07AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Again, "4E is not an RPG" was not meant as an attack on it as an excellent and often fun game. It was simply a formal definitional thing.<br/><br/>That said, the thing about skill DCs is interesting to me, and I must humbly apologize for getting that wrong\u2014it's been a long time since I read the books, and when I did read them the most recent was the DMG2, which has updated DCs-by-level for Skill Challenges (but doesn't mention other skill DCs, unless I am also misremembering that!). I will concede that if you use fiction-based skill DCs (many groups don't, but I will cop to the fact that it is in the rules), then 4E is an RPG.<br/><br/>But I think Adam is definitely onto something with "damn near discourages." I think "discourages" is an important word in these sorts of discussions. A game's mechanics can either get out of the way for you to roleplay, get in the way of roleplaying, or actively support your roleplaying. Early editions of D&amp;D seemed to follow the first path, while many have found that 4E (and 3rd, as well; see below) actively inhibits their roleplay. Obviously, indie games like AW are supposed to have rules that actively support the RP.<br/><br/>I certainly don't disagree that 3E and its successors can often suffer from many of the same problems as 4E. I do find it to be a fictionally richer game, though, in a few key ways. For example, don't discount the importance of those static rightward-pointing arrows I mentioned before. And if you don't like clouds-and-boxes theory, fine, but simply saying "it's stupid" isn't much of a refutation. (And remember, the first line of the essay is, "This is descriptive, not prescriptive." Vincent wasn't trying to tell anyone how to have fun, and neither am I.) Static rightward arrows aren't "when you do x, roll y" type rules, what they do instead is reflect our understanding of the fiction in ongoing ways.<br/><br/>Now, sure, 4E's monsters are given powers that reflect what type of creature they are. But description matters so little in that game, and reskinning is so trivially easy (both a good and bad thing), that it feels hollow. 3E, in contrast, is often clunky, but different types of powers really *feel* different. YMMV, BYOB, etc. :-)<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Fleming" title="James_Fleming"><img alt="James_Fleming" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Fleming">James_Fleming</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410216/#Comment_410216" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-23T09:30:45+00:00" title="March 23, 2013  9:30AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, this powers thing is something I have seen come up in quite a few discussions (And some I have had with other guys and girls GMing 4th, showing that it is genuinely a problem within the format/presentation). I had always taken it as given, and run with in my game that fireball, in addition to whatever d6+effect vs reflex of damage, <i>set things on fire.</i> Likewise, acid arrow was an <i>arrow, made of acid.</i><br/>And gave them abilities to that relevant to the fiction. You wanna burn through that wooden wall with your fireball, cool! etc. etc.<br/>Now see, I have though seen GMs that would have reacted as 'Cool, deal d6+effect vs reflex of damage to the wall'...<br/>This seems to, I dunno, not sit overly well with me. I took the italiccy description (Which is also in games is entirely mutable and can be hanged by the player when they take the power or at any level ala retraining. Say 'Form of Nature's Withering' instead of 'Form of the WInter Herald'... Those were some damn scary vines.) and ran with it. I don't see why anyone would ignore it.<br/><br/>There was an interesting experiment I tried a few months ago, in which I reformatted the 4th ed players handbook into a 3.5-esque style and presented it to a few 3.5 playing friends. With a simple change in formatting of the powers system, they actually seemed to enjoy the game a lot more.<br/>Altering, for example:<br/>'At level 1 take two at-will powers.' to 'At level 1 you gain 2 combat manouevres that can apply an additional affect to your melee basic attack on your turn.'<br/>And then reformatting powers like so:<br/>'Tide of iron, Str. vs AC., 1[w]+str and push one square, move into vacated space' to 'Tide of Iron: When you attack, you push your foe back with your shield as they reel from the blow. When you are wielding a shield and make a basic attack on your turn, if it hits, you may push the target 5 feet and choose to follow.'<br/><br/>Seems a lot of the key is in how you write it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410219/#Comment_410219" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-23T09:37:19+00:00" title="March 23, 2013  9:37AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have feelings, since I'm a heartless monster, so appeals to the "feel" of one book over another do not apply to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410225/#Comment_410225" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-23T10:45:21+00:00" title="March 23, 2013 10:45AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Again, "4E is not an RPG" was not meant as an attack on it as an excellent and often fun game.

He's been reloading and shooting for a while now and is well stocked with ammunition.  His melee capabilities are quite poor but the combination of his cross bow and his defensive position make staying where he is in a fight ideal.<br/><br/>A metal clad warrior approaches him, perhaps already having a few crossbow bolts in his shield.  He then stands there and taunts the crossbowmen to abandon his cover and face him in hand to hand combat.<br/><br/>In 3.x, what happens in response is pretty much 100% up to whichever person at the table is in charge of the crossbowman.  Though whatever he does, it'd probably be expected that whatever decision is made, it's in keeping with the fiction.  Perhaps he loads furiously and tries to get another bolt into the warrior.  Perhaps he flees to find a position further away from this melee threat.<br/><br/>in 4E, the player of the warrior does the "come and get it" encounter power.  He rolls his basic attack bonus and compares it to the targets will defense.  If he hits it, the target leaves his position of cover and moves next to the warrior and the warrior gets an immediate attack against him.  The crossbow men doesn't even get the opportunity to pull a melee weapon out.  He literally automatically rushes into melee by being pulled so many squares while still holding his crossbow.  The people at the table are left to come up with a fictional justification after the fact, but it's probably easier not to as its really about a pull effect on a power card.  This power is also not really an isolated case as lots of other martial powers and monster powers can have a similar effect, sometimes even without needing to hit the defense (if the pull effect is on a miss or effect line rather than a hit line in the description).<br/><br/>Imagine if on a 3.x/PF forum you posted as a player saying the following:<br/><br/>We were in a fight and I was hanging back and shooting my magic at the enemy.  Then one of the warriors came up and started taunting me.  The GM had me make a will save and since I failed, I had to rush into melee with him, even though I'm a mage and I would never do that.  I didn't get to choose what my character did.  And I asked, there was no charm or magic or supernatural ability involved at all.<br/><br/>The thread would be filled with people saying the GM screwed up and was doing it wrong.  On the account of who is in charge of what which characters do and on the application of the saving throw mechanic for a taunt.<br/><br/>On a 4E forum, the exact same scenario would get a chorus of "must have been a pull effect" and that the GM was doing it right.  Because he would have been.<br/><br/>They are not the same game.  3.x/PF is not an ideal game for making decisions based on the described fictional situation, but it is way, way better at concentrating play on that than 4E.  To say they are the same game, but 4E simply presents it clearer is totally and completely wrong.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410227/#Comment_410227" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-23T11:17:28+00:00" title="March 23, 2013 11:17AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Come And Get It isn't a typical 4E fighter power though?

Though whatever he does, it'd probably be expected that whatever decision is made, it's in keeping with the fiction.  Perhaps he loads furiously and tries to get another bolt into the warrior.  Perhaps he flees to find a position further away from this melee threat.<br/><br/>in 4E, the player of the warrior does the "come and get it" encounter power.  He rolls his basic attack bonus and compares it to the targets will defense.  If he hits it, the target leaves his position of cover and moves next to the warrior and the warrior gets an immediate attack against him.  The crossbow men doesn't even get the opportunity to pull a melee weapon out.  He literally automatically rushes into melee by being pulled so many squares while still holding his crossbow.  The people at the table are left to come up with a fictional justification after the fact, but it's probably easier not to as its really about a pull effect on a power card.  This power is also not really an isolated case as lots of other martial powers and monster powers can have a similar effect, sometimes even without needing to hit the defense (if the pull effect is on a miss or effect line rather than a hit line in the description).<br/><br/>Imagine if on a 3.x/PF forum you posted as a player saying the following:<br/><br/>We were in a fight and I was hanging back and shooting my magic at the enemy.  Then one of the warriors came up and started taunting me.  The GM had me make a will save and since I failed, I had to rush into melee with him, even though I'm a mage and I would never do that.  I didn't get to choose what my character did.  And I asked, there was no charm or magic or supernatural ability involved at all.<br/><br/>The thread would be filled with people saying the GM screwed up and was doing it wrong.  On the account of who is in charge of what which characters do and on the application of the saving throw mechanic for a taunt.<br/><br/>On a 4E forum, the exact same scenario would get a chorus of "must have been a pull effect" and that the GM was doing it right.  Because he would have been.<br/><br/>They are not the same game.  3.x/PF is not an ideal game for making decisions based on the described fictional situation, but it is way, way better at concentrating play on that than 4E.  To say they are the same game, but 4E simply presents it clearer is totally and completely wrong.<br/></blockquote>\nAlthough in every other edition an enemy mage can do the exact same effect except with a permanent duration (charm person) and no-one has a problem with it. This is what is commonly known as a double standard. <br/><br/>Note also that if you're going to play the 'they don't even get an opportunity to pull a melee weapon out' card you also have to account for the problems of the turn structure in every edition. For example, why is it impossible for two people to advance up a corridor next to each other at a pace of greater than five foot per round? Instead one advances something like 30 foot in one go and then a couple of seconds later the other one joins them with their own 30 ft leap. <br/><br/>Note again that D&amp;D is the game where certain individuals can sustain dozens of sword stabs to the throat without risk of death, or fall over a hundred feet with no possibility of death.  Also where you can learn how to bake bread by slaughtering a thousand goats. If you can accept those abstractions but not come and get it, this is not a signal that 4e is somehow beyone the pale. It's a signal that there are some abtractions you want to find an explanation for and some that you don't.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410270/#Comment_410270" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-23T18:28:38+00:00" title="March 23, 2013  6:28PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Again, "4E is not an RPG" was not meant as an attack on it as an excellent and often fun game. </blockquote>\nThere is only one possible way to respond to the statement that 'you think you're roleplaying but you're not', and that's as an attack.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_410272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/contracycle" title="contracycle (Banned)"><img alt="contracycle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/contracycle">contracycle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410272/#Comment_410272" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-23T18:58:05+00:00" title="March 23, 2013  6:58PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rubbish.
