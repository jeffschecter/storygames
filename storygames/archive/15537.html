I was browsing through a commemorative volume depicting the adventures of the Palestine Exploration Society, a group of mostly German-Jewish archaeologists that was established in the early 20th century, and was active during the time of the British Mandate for Palestine (1919-1948). I found one photograph particularly appealing: I want to make a short scenario of archaeological pulp ripe with ancient demons, secretive cults, trap-infested ruins and a dastardly power-thirsty villain based on the guys in that photograph.<br/><br/>You can view it <a href="http://i.imgur.com/GL09P.jpg" rel="nofollow">here (large-ish file)</a>. And <a href="http://i.imgur.com/98WhT.png" rel="nofollow">here</a> the expedition members are numbered, for easy reference.<br/><br/>And here are my questions. Feel free to make up as many outlandish details as you deem necessary:<br/>1. Which of these guys looks like he would be fun or interesting to play as protagonist? What can you tell me about him?<br/>2. Which of these guys looks like he would make a good villain? What can you tell me about him?<br/>3. Can you make out any interesting relationships between any of these guys?<br/>4. Would you add female characters to this group? If so, who would they be, and where are they when the photograph is being taken?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352230/#Comment_352230" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-22T04:59:25+00:00" title="December 22, 2011  4:59AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1. Those guys all look awesome. I'd want to play one or two (see below)<br/>2. Five is the villain, he's the sharpest dresser and least likely to be down in a hole looking for Absalom's tomb.<br/>3. One and two are clearly brothers. One is going blind. Both are out of shape and ill-suited for punching ancient demons in the face. <br/>4. She's obviously taking the picture. My guess is that she's a well-connected Briton who can grease the wheels for this dubious collection of German Jewish academics within the British Mandate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352253/#Comment_352253" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-22T08:58:52+00:00" title="December 22, 2011  8:58AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1.
