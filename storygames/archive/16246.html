Like most county seats up there in Western Massachusetts, Jamestown has a college: Walpurgis University. Though its foundation dates back to the 1860s, Walpurgis is a small place with a modest endowment, somewhat encumbered by a reputation for eccentricity: it is the sort of place that would hire Indiana Jones. The science faculty is on the edge of sci-fi, and the humanities staff edge into fantasy, but the scant resources, the odd reputation, and a few critical incidents of bad luck conspired to rob the place of the reputation it deserves.<br/><br/>In 1916 Walpurgis University sent a backup expedition to Maple White Land, which brought back a pterandon embryo in formalin. But their press conference was the day the <i>SS Lusitania</i> was sunk. In 1928 a junior chemistry professor built a working atomic pile in the squash courts, but abandoned the project when it became clear that his plan to transmute mercury into gold was not going to be profitable. In 1935 a PhD candidate in Food Science worked out how to make penicillin in bulk, but was ignored (largely because she was black). In 1953 Wal. U. Entomology staff destroyed a nest of radioactive mutant ants with a 55-gallon drum of DDT. In 1954 a Neanderthal played right tackle on the Wal. U. football team (he was a fine arts undergrad on a scholarship from Newfoundland). In 1955 a zombie zirus escaped from the microbiology lab, but nearly everyone was cured with an experimental antiviral drug. And so on.<br/><br/>Perhaps no-one actually knows that Professor Alanburg is re-animating corpses in the med school basement, but neither is anyone incredulous when Alanburg's Monster is found shambling the halls with Dr. Alanburg's severed head. If Dr. Traveller from Electrical Engineering asks for volunteers to come to the Cretaceous on a test of his time machine, the physics faculty doesn't say "Absurd! Impossible!". It starts arguing among itself about experiments that could possibly determine how the Grandfather Paradox is resolved. The reason is that about a quarter of the academic staff have either seen the Ark of the Covenant, drunk from the Holy Grail, operated an aircraft on beamed power, or synthesised traces of Cavorite. If they had the staff and money, they could overthrow the foundations of knowledge. But instead they have tenure at Walpurgis U.<br/><br/>One corner of the Senior Common Room at the Walpurgis University Faculty Club is  by longstanding custom reserved for a particular handful of very senior, very tweedy teaching staff. These fellows have had tenure for longer than anyone else can remember. And they relate the most amazing anecdotes, some of which have been dated by context as early as 1905. Anywhere else they would be considered to be spinning yarns. Anywhere else they would be challenged as liars, written off as senile old confabulators. But\u2026 this is Walpurgis. And there actually is a pterandon in formalin in the basement of Darwin Hall.<br/><br/><b>The Campaign</b><br/><br/>Okay, so the campaign is going to be about the adventures, or at least the stories, of a coterie of very old academics who have been on the staff at Walpurgis since at least before World War One. Why are they, as they seem, immortal? That varies, and at Wal. U. no-one is game to ask. Have they seen <i>everything</i> before? No, perhaps not. But if they haven't seen something bigger, then this reminds them of a very cold winter\u2026 during Prohibition\u2026 when they were on a field trip investigating the properties of diamond-bearing Kimberlite\u2026 in the Dolomite Mountains of northern Italy\u2026.<br/><br/>The frame story is sometime after about 1990, perhaps the present day. The adventures, on the other hand, are told in flashback to any time in the first three quarters of the 20th century, "back when we were younger". They are outrageous, Munchausenish anecdotes about larger-than-life globe-trotting academics: swashbuckling archaeologists, MacGuyvering scientists, practical magicians from the School of Mediaeval Metaphysics; stories that might just be believed\u2014at Walpurgis U. Each adventure will begin with an (NPC) grad student or junior member of faculty giving a breathless account of some modern marvel, and will proceed to the players (in character) offering "toppers" until one comes up that takes everyone's fancy, which we will then game out. Continuity from story to story will be negligible or less.<br/><br/><b>I Ask</b><br/><br/>\u2022 What game might be suitable for this campaign? Modified <i>Spirit of the Century</i>?<br/><br/>\u2022 What does everyone think of the idea of drawing random "during the", "while we were", pulp concept, and part-of-the-world cards?<br/><br/>\u2022 Any tips, tricks, or suggestions?<br/><br/>\u2022 Would you want to play?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment"

Players each spin off an entire yarn, pretty much uninterrupted. (Unless I'm wrong, but that's what I remember having heard.)<br/><br/>Most rpgs are, on the other hand, story constructing games. By that I mean that there are multiple inputs (players and randomizers, usually) each determining a portion of the story as it is constructed. Also, there's the difference of player identification with a single character that is most commonly used as a structure, and that's another difference, (in story telling, a single person is telling the actions of multiple characters - yes I know some rpgs do this, but most don't is my point).<br/><br/>What you're describing sounds more focused on story telling rather than story constructing. But maybe that's not the case. Maybe the story teller part is mostly a frame story and thematic element used to guide story constructing.<br/><br/>Figuring out where your concept fits into those categorizations (and maybe you see it fitting some where in between, with a lot of single-person-telling combined with minor multiple-inputs-constructing elements) may help with making better recommendations.<br/><br/><br/>One thing it reminds me of - Leverage RPG. With the way it uses flashbacks as a significant mechanical element. And something else about it makes me think that it could be tweaked to fit, but I'm not sure what it is. I'd have to go back and look at it. But I get this sense about it that the game would feel almost as much like you were telling a reminiscence about "this one heist we did once" as much as it would feel like you were live in the middle of it. Or maybe just that you could make that adjustment in tone and it wouldn't break it. Also, the way that it runs at a relatively high level, rather than using deeply detailed skill lists, would help it be a good match for what you're talking about. Might be worth considering.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_370783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370783/#Comment_370783" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-02T18:16:16+00:00" title="April  2, 2012  6:16PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, this is pretty straightforward. Munchausen or Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries either do this pretty much as-is. Munchausen is lighter on the rules (although not non-existent), while the Committee is somewhat closer to a traditional rpg's mechanical intensity. I'd suggest checking out both - this is well-defined if rare genre, so there's no reason not to examine the field well before going forward.<br/><br/>Using a traditional rpg like Spirit of the Century or whatever is, of course, possible, but then you'll need to do some serious design work to figure out how to structure the game around the premise of round-robin flashback storytelling. Not a trivial feat to my mind, and the aforementioned games already have figured out this part, so I wouldn't be compelled to start over again, myself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_370805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370805/#Comment_370805" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-02T20:12:38+00:00" title="April  2, 2012  8:12PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob, Munchausen the game is entirely dependent on other players interrupting a story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_370999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Agemegos" title="Agemegos"><img alt="Agemegos" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Agemegos">Agemegos</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370999/#Comment_370999" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-03T15:30:52+00:00" title="April  3, 2012  3:30PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 3, 2012 3:34PM by Agemegos.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In answer to RobMcDiarmid's incisive question, I definitely had an idea of this as a story-<i>constructing</i> game, or as I would put it as a game of <i>collaborative</i> improvisation of stories in the trad RPG form (i.e. there is a GM, and each other play contributes principally by narrating the speech and action of one recurring character). Essentially, I was thinking of it as a role-playing game with strong improv elements (miniminal GM prep), increased authorship for the character-players, and drastically reduced continuity between adventures. The frame story is partly a randomising element, and partly a distancing mechanism to ease my character-players' discomfort with taking on authority traditionally assigned to the GM, upsetting the prepared story, and counting on things that aren't right. I hope that the suggestion that the "adventure" is a story that might be exaggerated, edited, "improved on reality", or even partly confabulated by a trio of old codgers might ease player's anxiety about "making things up" which they feel the GM ought to have control of.<br/><br/>I have run something similar once before, a campaign in which the PCs were elderly members of a London club for explorers and travellers about 1900, telling stories of their adventures a generation earlier (with yetis, and lost cities in Arabia, and so forth). That was about 1989 or 1990, if I recall correctly, and I had a group then of players with a robust habit and good craft when it came to treating RP as a collaborative extemporary storytelling game. Also, we played a lot of RPG together, and were all in practice with one-another's narrative jamming styles and practices.<br/><br/>I don't have a group like that any more, and besides some features of the traditional 1980s RPG we were using back then (<i>ForeSight</i>) were more of a hindrance than a help: I am thinking of its experience and study systems in particular. It seems to me that many of the features of story games (I am thinking particularly of Aspects, Declarations, and Invokes for Effect) are an ideal substitute for the craft that my current players lack.<br/><br/>I am particular interested in finding out whether there are other mechanics in the indie toolbox that might be of use to me in this. But I'm definitely thinking of a storytelling jam session in which everyone collaborates, and not of a round robin of improv solos. Sorry about not making that clear at the outset.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Agemegos" title="Agemegos"><img alt="Agemegos" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Agemegos">Agemegos</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371000/#Comment_371000" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-03T15:40:52+00:00" title="April  3, 2012  3:40PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The previous campaign was Kipling, Rider Haggard, and Jack London.

We'll try running this using the closed-beta version of Roll20, and if that turns out not to suit out needs (or not to work!) we'll switch to Google+ Hangouts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
