One thing caught my eye - it was very simple toy. Just a board with picture of a house and a lawn. The fun part were stickers of  characters from the Little Mole, old czech cartoon. You can put them wherever you want on the picture, remove and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd..it's enough for the story game! One or more persons choose their characters from the stickers, put them on the pictureboard, another is narrator and starts the scene. Depending on the rules, players can act the characters(I don't think my nephew would need acting part, though) or narrator just tells the scene. Then stickers are removed and someone else becomes the narrator. And so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I can steal this idea of stickers and picture for one of my real game. But first I need to playtest The Litle Mole Game on the next Ksawery's visit.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119223/#Comment_119223" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-12T15:38:45+00:00" title="January 12, 2008  3:38PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A group of stuffed animals works just as well.  Or hand puppets.  Or (my choice when I was a kid) those peg-shaped Playskool figures.  Bring 'em together, set up the scene, get into character, and you're off and running.  Sound effects are encouraged, as is in-character dialogue and scenes of thrilling action.  If you don't like someone else's idea, you look at them with visible horror and disgust and say "NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENS, DO SOMETHING ELSE." -- either they'll explain what they're trying to do and sell you on it, or they'll do something better, or they'll critically fail and you'll have to snatch up your characters and stomp off angrily.  If you're running low on ideas, you ask someone else what happens next.  If you get tired, you go take a nap.  It works for one-shots, long campaigns, and even holds up well to repeated playthroughs of the same basic scenario.<br/><br/><br/>Funny thing, though -- we never called it a "story game" when I was a kid.  Maybe because we were using miniatures?  ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
