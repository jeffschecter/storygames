Specifically, this refers to comments about not saying negative/critical things about games and sticking only to the positive.<br/><br/>Good vibes are great.  It's not criticism that screws with the vibes, though.  It's folk making it personal.<br/><br/>I know a lot of folk have a financial incentive with regard to looking good here.  These are people folk may be working with in the future, and these are customers.  I don't expect a marketer or an author to criticize the products they're involved with.  But I do hope that other folk will criticize, in as good natured a way as they're able, in order to both inform the rest of us and offer the creator some honest feedback on their craft.  Saying "Game X is a great game but it didn't work for my group because of X" doesn't upset the zen of Story-Games.  Rather, it serves the very purpose of the community - building and enjoying great games.  To say it once and then keep it to yourself amounts to just positively endorsing all the games you come across.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128670/#Comment_128670" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T12:29:03+00:00" title="February 21, 2008 12:29PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2008 12:29PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (general agreement)<br/><br/>In my <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5495&amp;page=1#Item_11" rel="nofollow">Classroom Deathmatch AP report</a> I gave the game some tough love.

I like the writing, the style, and the presentation.  <br/><br/>However, the CR section of IAWA was not easy for me to follow. The use of examples to display the system, rather than being used to demonstrate a system already displayed, made it a bit head churning for me to get to the core of the rules the first time through. It also made individual cases rather hard to look up when we had questions in the middle of play. (Only having the .pdf did not help this, but I think I would have had the same problem at a smaller degree with a print book.) <br/><br/>In talking about this with Dave Cleaver I summed it up quickly, if awkwardly, by saying "In general in instruction you're told to tell people what you're going to tell them, tell them, then tell them what you told them. I think IAWA skips the first part in the CR section. So you go right into the being told, without knowing exactly what it is you're being told and so being unable to set up the model."<br/><br/>I know others probably read the text differently, but for me there were (shock) too many examples, and the examples came too early. It did make the first three conflicts in my game more clunky as we figured shit out. Past that point, when we no longer had to look things up, play went swimmingly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129576/#Comment_129576" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T21:37:39+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  9:37PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>In my<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5495&amp;page=1#Item_11" rel="nofollow">Classroom Deathmatch AP report</a>I gave the game some tough love.
