That's where the real fun begins, especially in a custom campaign rather than prebuilt modules. What surprise will a player throw at you? will they react as you think they will, as you prepared? will they choose an alternate path? <br/><br/>I loved handing at least one wish a campaign. Everyone hated me handing out wishes. Wish for gold, I take it from the nearest Kingdom or dragon, now you got a pissed off King or dragon after you. A wish is the ultimate going head-to-head with the players, they are trying to out think you and you are trying to out think them. One guy wished for skin as hard as armor, I gave lizard's scaly skin and the general appearance of a humanoid lizard. What will they do? how will they react? how fast can you think?</blockquote>\nI find this fascinating.<br/><br/>Have you ever had any experiences with Wish spells, this kind of GMing?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445157/#Comment_445157" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-09T06:54:21+00:00" title="May  9, 2015  6:54AM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I gave a presentation about this to a GM's conference one time. Actually "gaming" wishes is one of the things that happens a lot in the underlying fantasy material - in the Arabian Nights a guy wishes for a banquet, then sells off the silverware.  I think the kind of material described here is a trash-tier level way to handle what is interesting - the person understands that the fun part of a wish is when you give the player what they ask for, but doesn't understand that the consequences that should come from that is from the character's desire, not God's "ingenuity".  In other words, if you make a character rich, then give them a swarm of beggars and brothers-in-law who all want gold, don't just take the money from a dragon or something. In the Arabian Nights you can sometimes get a kingdom just from showing up to the sultan on the right day - "Praise be to God! The burden of the kingdom is lifted from my shoulders! I shall spend the rest of my days in humble prayer. It's all yours, kid."  But what makes that interesting is the conviction that this decision has consequences beyond what is anticipated, not just beyond what is spoken.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445165/#Comment_445165" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-09T15:33:29+00:00" title="May  9, 2015  3:33PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First, for playing alone, I strongly suggest checking out the <a href="http://www.mythic.wordpr.com/page14/page9/page9.html" rel="nofollow">Mythic GM Emulator</a>. It's a great facilitator for solo play.<br/><br/>It's been a while (AD&amp;D 2nd edition) since the "wish" spell came up.  The way I remember, everybody was both fascinated and afraid of it. Our common understanding was: if you really needed something, you would get it - if you wanted too much, it would be a burden sooner or later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445170/#Comment_445170" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-09T22:10:10+00:00" title="May  9, 2015 10:10PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's pretty much how I've always handled them. It got to the point that my players would spend the days between sessions writing out intricately phrased, legal contractesque wishes trying to keep me from exploiting them.<br/><br/>One of my friends was DMing a Middle Earth campaign and wanted to show me that I didn't have to be such a strict dick with wishes and eventually gave each player in the group one. I used mine to wish that: "As Sauron destroyed the white tree of Minas Ithil it's falling seeds, mingled with the blood of the fallen of Numenor, and in the light of both sun and moon, germinated the sudden growth of a new Telperion and Laurelin within Middle Earth, whose power formed a bridge to the land of the Valar, allowing them to stand invulnerable to servants of Morgoth in this realm, and whose majesty inspired all the races of that world to unite in their defense, convincing Isildur to follow the advice of the others and cast the ring into the fires while they had the chance." He sat there for a few minutes blinking until he realized the impact that would have on the world before saying something like "Ok, I get it now".<br/><br/>Ever since then we've all been careful to treat 'wishes' more like 'limited wish' spells, with strict guidelines to their scope and fulfillment.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
