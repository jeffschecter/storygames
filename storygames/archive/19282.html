Crazy story behind this one, I'll write it up tomorrow. It's also short, I think I might tighten it down to a nano game soon. It took me about two hours to write, and it's very much an ashcan release right now. Still, I'd appreciate any advice, from font choice to rules to editing to (*gasp*) playtesting.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429494/#Comment_429494" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-16T06:12:04+00:00" title="March 16, 2014  6:12AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool beans! /sub for now, but one thing jumped out at me: the typeface is interesting and quirky, but it and the colours are rather garish and clash with the cover art in a way that's likely to put people off. I'll try to read the game later on today and give you more detailed feedback then.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429495/#Comment_429495" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-16T07:56:41+00:00" title="March 16, 2014  7:56AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting concept, Paul.  I playtested it solo this morning.  I think the dice mechanics might make it too easy to win unless the PM allows only very small actions, so it all seems to be about how just large an action the PM will allow.  Perhaps I need to see some more examples of what counts as an "action".<br/><br/>About the dice mechanics: You say "Highest roll is the only one that counts."  If I'm reading you correctly, this means it's to my advantage to always roll all three dice because it will only count as a 1 if I roll triple 1's.  The chance of rolling triple 1's is a little less than 0.5%.  If I can get another obake to donate a die to the roll, the chance of losing a die drops to less than 0.1%.<br/><br/>About the narrative mechanics: If I roll a 6 the rules say I can specify three actions instead of just one.  Are these actions all pre-specified?  IOW, should I say what all three actions might be <i>before</i> I make the dice roll, or do I just say one of them, and then come up with the other two after the roll?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
