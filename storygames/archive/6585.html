You know what?  There's a lot of good stuff out there!  I'd like to take a few minutes here to give some shout outs \u2013 not to models per se, but to broad features of those models that I feel are crucial to understanding roleplaying.  I'm looking here at the structure of models in a very high-level, abstract sense.  Here we go:\n<ul><li>Processes\n<ul><li>I think it's important to recognize, first, that roleplaying is an activity that happens over time, and second, the current state of the game is therefore a snapshot of a ongoing process.  From there, the next leap is to realize that multiple sub-processes may be occurring simultaneously.  Naturally, no one covers this ground better than the Process Model.  While these insights may seem stunningly obvious, they're sometimes overlooked, and the Process Model's forceful statements in this regard are pure genius.  When the process nature of roleplaying isn't paid adequate attention, we often end up reifying a process into an object and confusing ourselves (e.g. System and Creative Agenda.)  As another model that explicitly touches on the passage of time, the AGE Model deserves mention.</li></ul></li>\n<li>Feedback loops\n<ul><li>Since the state of the game changes over time, it's apparently intuitively obvious to nearly everyone that the present state of the game influences what we do next, and what we do influences what the next state will be.  A model without some sort of feedback loop would seem to ignore one or the other of these two aspects.  See the Social-Play Model, the Interaction Model, or the Process Model for good examples of feedback.  (Aside: In a certain sense, processes and feedback imply each other.)</li></ul></li>\n<li>Layers\n<ul><li>The Big Model and its derivative variants may be the only models I've seen with layers.  This is a good idea \u2013 many other models try to model everything in a \u201ctwo dimensional\u201d way, and thus end up conflating different sorts of animals.  Not to pick on it in particular, but the Process Model contains a clear example of this problem.  It correctly picks out that there are \u201croleplaying processes\u201d and \u201csocial processes,\u201d and that these are somehow different without quite pinpointing the relationship.  The model conceives of them as occurring side by side, without discerning that roleplaying processes are dependent on the social processes at work.  The lumpley definition of System at the very least strongly implies this dependence, since System is conceptualized as the process by which participants agree, whether that agreement is generated by mechanics or not.  This is just one example where a layer conception allows us to further specify the relationships for increased clarity.</li></ul></li>\n<li>Emergence\n<ul><li>Wikipedia says \u201cemergence refers to the way complex systems and patterns arise out of a multiplicity of relatively simple interactions.\u201d  I don't take this to the \u201cdefinitive\u201d definition (ha!), but it's good enough to get the point across.  To my knowledge, the best use of this idea in a model of roleplaying comes from Mendel's PCon3, though the AGE Model also touches on emergence in its description of how \u201cspaces\u201d come into being.  Notice though how well the notion of emergence complements the notion of levels or layers \u2013 emergence is a fantastic explanation for how layers come into existence.  Both PCon3 and the AGE Model seem to ignore layers in favor of a flat structure, and both seem to suffer for it.  Combining emergence and layers seems natural, and I feel that these two structures have a lot to offer each other when taken as a pair.</li><ul></ul></ul></li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146301/#Comment_146301" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T19:27:29+00:00" title="May 27, 2008  7:27PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 27, 2008 7:27PM by Max Higley.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<ul><li>Individual and collective\n<ul><li>Models I've encountered have tended to focus on one or the other.  The TBM is the classic expression of focusing on the collective.  Examples of focusing on the individuals include Mo's sockets and Levi's taxonomy of types of enjoyment.  The interconnections between individual preferences, goals, and actions and group function should be fertile ground.  Notice that this is precisely where the issue of \u201cindividual imagined spaces\u201d and their intersection or lack thereof with \u201cshared imagined space\u201d comes into play.  This can be spotted in the Social-Play Model and the Process Model, though perhaps the best expression of this is again PCon3, which should come as no huge surprise: the relationship of individual to collective is precisely what emergence is about, and PCon3 is all about emergence.  (Another aside: while the influence of individuals on the collective is fairly obvious, also consider the influence of the collective on the individual.  This is a largely unexplored avenue, as far as I know, and an interesting one since it would complete a feedback loop.)</li></ul></li>\n<li>Inside and outside\n<ul><li>There is sometimes a tendency to think of players as black boxes, with inputs and outputs and no way to see what's going on inside.  I find this \u201cexterior surfaces only\u201d treatment of players to be an unfortunate reductionism.  Many, if not most, models make some reference to player goals or preferences, which is at least a start to tackling the interior world.  A much smaller number of models explicitly connect the feedback loop from the current state of the game (outside) to preferences that influence the selection (inside) of future actions which affect the state of the game (outside).  Providing a clear explanation of the causal relationships present in this cycle is a task I feel has yet to be satisfactorily completed.  The Social-Play Model depicts the connection in a diagram but doesn't discuss it much.  PCon3 points out a particular aspect of this process, namely how focusing on different subsets of the available inputs will affect the decision making process.  The Interaction Model implies it by placing Goals as part of the feedback cycle.  The AGE Model is perhaps most explicit, though it spends only a paragraph. In defense of these models, the interior is a tougher area to approach than the exterior.  We can approach it either by introspection (in the case of ourselves), or through dialogue (in the case of others.)  Exploring the relationships between inside and outside is another area that seems potentially fruitful.</li></ul></li></ul>\nMy hope is that this catalog of useful theoretical structures will provoke new attempts at synthesis and exploration of some new avenues.  What would you add to this list?  What other happy marriages between these concepts might we make?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146306/#Comment_146306" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T20:00:54+00:00" title="May 27, 2008  8:00PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 27, 2008 8:01PM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd add "Core conceptions."<br/><br/>That is, I suspect that there's a big, big discussion about what the players of a given game conceive of a roleplaying game as being, and what they believe it <i>does</i>.

Honestly, I imagine that layers could be sliced in a whole number of different ways, depending on what you were trying to get at.<br/><br/>One interesting trait of this approach to theory is that, while it's focused on how groups create their own idiosyncratic behavioral norms, I think many people active in this kind of thinking are disinterested in creating an idiosyncratic way of talking about roleplaying, even if that might ease intercommunication between various writers.  As such, there's relatively little shared terminology and no general effort to make everything fit together.  Everybody is basically doing their own thing, but with a shared set of concerns.  That's partially a structural thing that comes from these discussions largely taking place on individual blogs, but it's also part of a larger philosophy about how to approach theory in general, I suspect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146402/#Comment_146402" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T10:02:42+00:00" title="May 28, 2008 10:02AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a certain recognition by post-formal thinkers that formalism fails in certain regards.  Meaning is dependent on context, contexts are boundless, and the ability to choose the context forces us to create our own meaning.  This naturally leads to criticism of formal structures themselves as well privileged viewpoints and colonialized discourse.  I've certainly seen that happen in roleplaying theory -- it seems to be widely recognized that there is no formal system of rules that defines roleplaying.  I suspect the move toward the sort of philosophy you describe is tied into this sort of post-formal critique of formal systems (e.g. TBM) and the problems inherent in that approach.  And I think that's a positive step.<br/><br/>I also think there's something on the other side, a post-post-formal school of thought, which one might call dialectical thinking.  That drives my approach here -- I'm trying to create at toolbox for looking at forms, processes, relationships, and development in roleplaying as an integrated whole.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146405/#Comment_146405" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T10:14:16+00:00" title="May 28, 2008 10:14AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You just broke my brain, Max.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146407/#Comment_146407" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T10:15:25+00:00" title="May 28, 2008 10:15AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder if "Creation vs. Consumption" is a structure of the sort that belongs on your list - that is, the demands of making a story vs. the demands of enjoying one.

A good reference for this is Basseches' "Dialectical Thinking and Adult Development."  He identifies 24 characteristics of dialectical thought -- basically moves that dialectical thinkers make.  The idea is not that doing one of them necessarily means you're thinking dialectically, but that when taken together as an synthesized mode of thought, that's dialectical thought.  (You can find the list <a href="http://www.integralworld.net/ross2.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> in the appendix, but it doesn't have descriptions.)<br/><br/>I suspect that the next movement will be toward that mode of thought because people tend to develop it after developing post-formal thinking.

I'm trying to point out structures found in models that might be fruitful to combine with each other, in a sort of thesis-antithesis-synthesis sort of movement.

I'm saying if your model doesn't include these in it somewhere, you may not be taking advantage of all the tools you have at your disposal.

However: roleplaying games differs from other games by being played with a broader range of <i>methodical tools</i>, surpassing the mechanical paradigm of the boardgame. <i>"<b>Method</b>" </i>has been my key phrase to this field for more than a decade now, as I've tried to expand my theoretical understanding of RPGs, and tried to develop my design-skills (searching for methodical tools that enables great gameplay).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146580/#Comment_146580" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T23:16:25+00:00" title="May 28, 2008 11:16PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Max Higley</cite><br/>Short version: I had this thought, and it's still partial, but I think that piece might be useful, so I wanted to share.

Or something. <br/><br/>Yeah, I dunno... your way of explaining the status interactions seems like it could apply to the sort of Layers structure you derive from the Big Model, thereby striking Layers from the list.<br/><br/>Status is just... lodged deeply enough in our hindbrains that I think it might merit more consideration. Maybe it isn't a structure of the kind we're talking about (but I still don't know <i>exactly</i> what kind we're talking about!), but I don't think you can just say "it's a process, negotiated between people, meh, done." I don't think it's dependent on those structures in the way you seem to mean.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Another way of stating what we've got on the structures list: "People do stuff over time, between each other and on their own, within themselves and outwardly, taking results into account to inform next actions, and having results they may or may not predict." Okay, I'm finding this helpful as a way of seeing what might be missing: people might do stuff <b>on purpose</b> or <b>not.</b> Also, a thing that might merit being tracked separately: the input of <b>randomization.</b> (Which is not actually what I mean by "on purpose or not," nor by "having results they may or may not predict" - the latter means emergence, and emergent != random.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146740/#Comment_146740" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-29T16:57:57+00:00" title="May 29, 2008  4:57PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Randomness...now that's fascinating.

Second, to model processes that don't yet have a sufficient description and/or that are beyond the scope of the current effort.  If I want to look at say, how often player intent is satisfied by the resolution system and how often it isn't, then how the players choose their intent may be something I don't care too much about for the moment.

That's different.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anders%20Nygaard" title="Anders Nygaard"><img alt="Anders Nygaard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/404/nXX62OQ3D3YOT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anders%20Nygaard">Anders Nygaard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147561/#Comment_147561" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T06:36:09+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  6:36AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hum. Don't want to put down any of the models - lots of very insightful stuff there. But I'm kind of confused by a couple of tendencies in model builders. (Hit me with the shut-up stick if I've read them all wrong, or if this has been said a million times before :) This drive toward self-contained, closed, all-encompassing models - why? They usually draw on a wide selection of academic concepts. Some state their sources, some don't. But they do not connect the dots, or do much serious comparition, or attempt to map out relationships to theories describing other media, modes of communication, art forms, dramatic traditions, whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink of basic linguistics, with tools like discourse analysis and its competing theories of language and meaning. From the bare minimum I know of it, I'm pretty sure that, applying it to the unique mode of communication taking place in a game session, we ought to be able to tease out some really interesting facts about the nuts and bolts of roleplaying games. Same goes for a heap of other disciplines.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point of making a model must be to teach us new things about roleplaying games. All of these models do that, but they seem to me to be making their work harder than it needs to be, by skipping the obvious first step - attempting to describe the uniqueness and newness of roleplaying games within a much larger context, using the models for understanding media we already have. (Or do they? Maybe I'm just not looking at them right...?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147576/#Comment_147576" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T07:25:42+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  7:25AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2008 7:27AM by Max Higley.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most of them don't.  The Process Model may be influenced by the work of Alfred North Whitehead, but I'm not sure.<br/><br/>I can see at least two reasons that model makers usually don't make connections to other fields.  First, they'd have to have pretty detailed knowledge of those fields, which most people don't.  Second, roleplaying is different than most other media in some pretty fundamental ways.  Participation in creating the story is one of them.<br/><br/>ETA: If you've got particular connection in mind, I highly encourage pursuing that avenue.  It's a good one, just not something most people either able or care to take.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anders%20Nygaard" title="Anders Nygaard"><img alt="Anders Nygaard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/404/nXX62OQ3D3YOT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anders%20Nygaard">Anders Nygaard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148350/#Comment_148350" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-05T08:35:32+00:00" title="June  5, 2008  8:35AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding the fundamental difference - yes. But that shouldn't stop the guys who work with the kind of theoretical framework that tries to describe all kinds of different media. The thing about science is that if you you're willing to change your focus enough, sooner or later you will find something you can use to start building your way back up again toward a description, even if you have to go right down to physics or abstract mathematics.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what I want is more Feyerabend. Forget the theories and methods, just start describing and then make up the theory to fit afterwards. Its how it's really done anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a lot of parallells to comics - it's relatively new at being taken seriously as a medium, so no one has a common theory and a vocabulary to describe what's going on in there very accurately. So you'll find a lot of references to it as a "hybrid" medium, because people grasp at vocabularies adapted to several different similar media to describe it. The thing is, even though it's really inaccurate and leads to a lot of stupid misunderstandings and bad comics, the hybrid approach worked (at least initially), because it gives you somewhere to stand, something to push against and disagree with. If you don't have that, you're like an astronaut trapped floating in the middle of a room. You're in space, but it's no good to you because you can only spin around your own axis and soon you'll die of thirst. Some of the most famous scientists are famous because everyone's so dead set on proving them wrong, they keep referring to them in paper after paper.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for having detailed knowledge of a field, maybe a bit true. But you can't sit around waiting for perfect omniscience before you do anything. Best way to learn is to learn a bit, suggest something based on it, get savaged by an angry pack of besserwissers, take the useful things they throw at you and leave the rest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148380/#Comment_148380" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-05T10:02:41+00:00" title="June  5, 2008 10:02AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Anders Nygaard</cite>As for having detailed knowledge of a field, maybe a bit true.
