Not a revolutionary idea, but a new one to me from a design and play perspective. <br/><br/>The characters can face multiple challenges in a single scene, and other than agreeing upon the type of challenges (and the nature of the challenge environment) there's nothing to stop multiple disconnected challenges from appearing in a single scene. You might get "you lose all your stuff" and "get attacked by wolves" in the "Snowy forest" scene. <br/><br/>Sometimes this can seem pretty cool and action-movie-escalation-esque, especially when the challenges sort of complement each other. Sometimes though, at least conceptually, I'm wondering if it is a problem if they <i>don't</i> do that. I haven't come up with any concrete examples from actual play, but I could see a situation in which the challenges seem impossible or improbable to coincide, especially at a particular scene or location. <br/><br/>Do you think this provides interesting hooks for the players to collaborate on how these seemingly disconnected events happen (especially in a group survival vs the wilderness game), or do they break your immersion if they don't immediately line up to your expectations of the genre or narrative? Do you have any experience with this type of scenario?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450778/#Comment_450778" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-20T22:04:53+00:00" title="January 20, 2016 10:04PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experience is that, unless you want a wacky-and-fun-brainstorming adventure, you'll need to create a coherent set of guidelines/limitations for these cards, or choose from a selection, or both, so that the game can proceed with some focus.<br/><br/>Are you familiar with <i>Afraid</i>?

The game I'm working on isn't meant to be wacky necessarily, but it is meant to be very collaborative and narratively driven (loaded terms, but, bear with me). So, I definitely want guidelines or constraints, but I don't want them to be so tightly funneled so as to dramatically limit the narrative. <br/><br/>I've had three playtests and it hasn't been an issue with my (albeit small, somewhat creatively comfortable) group. I'm just concerned that it will be an issue and something I can't uncover without a lot of extra playtesting (something which I'm working on, but haven't been able to orchestrate yet).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450780/#Comment_450780" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-20T22:14:43+00:00" title="January 20, 2016 10:14PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            See if all of your successful scene ideas/seeds have anything in common.

So far it is just the phantom of the problem that I'm worried about, as it hasn't manifested itself really yet. \n<blockquote>Instead write down "someone is hostile" and leave it to the Players to dress it up with a specific color depending on the specific fictional situation you have at hand...</blockquote>\nThat's actually how the game started out - I had a set of generic challenges like Enemy, Environment, etc - but it sort of lacked bite and made people have to come up with things spontaneously in the situation, which inadvertently slowed the pace of the game down. With something a little more concrete it makes it easier for the person to describe the challenge and the reason for it existing, rather than describing something that fits within a rough framework.<br/><br/>Part of the fun of the game too is the initial collaborative stage where we create the scenes and the challenges, so we can kind of dread the things that are coming up in the back of our mind (and some people take sort of a cruel pleasure in coming up with especially nasty challenges that just <i>might</i> get pulled at some critical point).<br/><br/>To be clear, the game is GMless, and isn't built necessarily around "winning" as much as it is about experiencing and creating a survival story. <br/><br/>Good advice all around, I'll check out TacticalOps and FateLess as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450804/#Comment_450804" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-21T17:39:39+00:00" title="January 21, 2016  5:39PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What if you combine those two ideas, and have threats/challenges created by combining items from column A and column B?<br/><br/>"A" includes things that are vague prompts.

This helps encourage internal conflict and betrayal already).<br/><br/>Number 6, an Unsettling Development, I think could be pretty cool and interesting as there isn't necessarily a "right" answer, and just based upon the conclusions and perceptions of the characters and players. So it could be something like "all the food disappears." Who took the food? How? Why? etc. Although, I'm wondering if again, it maybe isn't useful enough to be one of the core six options. <br/><br/>What do you guys think?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450811/#Comment_450811" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-21T19:18:04+00:00" title="January 21, 2016  7:18PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On my first tries with a similar system it was easy to get wacky-gonzo stuff without really trying to. Playing that relaxed way is also fun and refreshing, though if it's not what you want, you will certainly need to add some limits through guidelines, and perhaps present those constrains as creative challenges.<br/><br/>Now I use a combination of a <a href="https://resourcefullrpg.wordpress.com/2012/04/14/8/" rel="nofollow">randomizer</a> and player input for many (tried and tested) reasons. <br/><br/>Player input is great, it allows the GM to relax a lot and still get wonderful material for the session. It's easier to satisfy the players tastes and mood when they say exactly what they want. Whenever you say yes to whatever they want and build upon it, it creates trust and that simple recognition to their input makes them more eager and open to collaborate, increasing the game Flow. Whenever a player creates something and it's taken and recognized bu other players, they get emotionally invested on it a bit, which is key to motivate them later to interact with the fiction in a non-destructive way.<br/><br/>Have players help you create a setting and you will have them in the same page as you; you won't have to shove them tons of info at the start of the game nor explain everything again and again every now and then. You won't have to drag them and convince them to hate or love a place or a character. And they will probably have better ideas that you could have ever think of.<br/><br/>You can always keep the surprise and wonder of exploration. For starters, who said all they have created is the actual truth? I often state at the world creation stage that whatever they are making is what their characters know and may or may not be accurate. Also, it's best to have the players create fragmented bits of info so you can later fill the gaps through the game. <br/><br/>The randomizer is there to help fill those gaps, keep some sort of coherence using a limited list of entries as said above and help players (and GMs) having  a blank page syndrome to get some inspiration, to keep the game from stalling (something very important on a game where real-time player input is needed.) And also, to avoid Czege's principle.<br/><br/>About you particular system, I wouldn't recommend randomizing the places, at least not by writing them in the cards and shuffling those into the deck. For me it works best to have the players mark those locations on a map drawn by them. Then I roll 2d6 over that map and use the places they fell as the start and ending of the current adventure or arc. <br/><br/>The values of the dice mark how dangerous is the location, so that itself can tell what the story is about. If they are going from one dangerous place to a safe one, they are escaping some threat. It it's the opposite, they are going to confront the main threat. If both are dangerous, they are meant to escape through the worst place possible while in pursue. If both values are low they will find the danger on the road, perhaps while escorting someone or delivering goods/a message. You can interpret the rolls differently according to whatever think the players, too.<br/><br/>Also, you can formalize a simple technique like "That doesn't make sense" as a rule, so players can veto a particular combination and try again a new one without feeling like they are breaking the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450812/#Comment_450812" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-21T19:22:42+00:00" title="January 21, 2016  7:22PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So rather than pulling from two piles - I'm thinking of just incorporating that into the rules and having the prompt / threat template be easily rollable with a d6.

I think the "previous choice" one is pretty cool.<br/><br/>Number 5, an Internal Threat, could be something like sickness, lack of food, exhaustion, people don't trust each other, things like that. I can see it working on some cases, but not a wide variety. (Also, bear in mind, the game has a strict challenge scene, social scene cadence in which you recharge your character abilities in social scenes. This helps encourage internal conflict and betrayal already).<br/><br/>Number 6, an Unsettling Development, I think could be pretty cool and interesting as there isn't necessarily a "right" answer, and just based upon the conclusions and perceptions of the characters and players. So it could be something like "all the food disappears." Who took the food? How? Why? etc. Although, I'm wondering if again, it maybe isn't useful enough to be one of the core six options. <br/><br/>What do you guys think?</blockquote>\nIt has a Fiasco-like feeling to me, but sounds great!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bendutter" title="bendutter"><img alt="bendutter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/722/nIUA15RZGEM8B.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bendutter">bendutter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450813/#Comment_450813" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-21T20:27:01+00:00" title="January 21, 2016  8:27PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A lot of interesting comments <a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a> , I'll do some thinking about that.

This is still alpha, so I'm sure it'll be illustrative during playtesting. Thanks again!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
