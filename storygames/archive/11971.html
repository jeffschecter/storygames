Yes, The Philosopher's Stone, lol.  Or, possibly Quest for the Philosopher's Stone.  Except, I wanted to base any fate mechanics on Tarot cards, rather than tables, and there is way too much for me to have time to post now anyway.  But the point is, I have done some thinking on these things you are asking about, so here goes some quick first thoughts:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Absolutely.  I don't think it matters yet what "people want" as much as go ahead and get a group together and find out if people want it (which you pretty much did).  I doubt the guys who wrote Universalis actually knew if people would want it when they first were struck with the concept.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) I think more play-testing is the only way to answer that question<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not experienced enough to answer 3 or 4, but I will make one comment that I hope Ralph or someone can respond to.  That is, I used to think "If I could just make the perfect Universal RPG system for me" then I could run any genre or setting (or themes) with it and it would do what I want.  But after spending some time looking at some of the cooler RPGs out there which have come out of independent development, I've realized that the most likable games are the ones where the system creates a special synergy with the proposed genre or setting (or themes).  BRS is a great example.  The way all the little dice rules work, and the way you challenge the stories of other players.... it all fits great with the bloody, over the top, epic, violent and irreverant setting that's made for it.  So I don't really care about "Universal" RPGs any more.  As useful and as great as the ideas in Universalis are, it's not especially a game that gets me juiced to go play it.  So I would say that what you are doing is a great idea, if you can find the magic between system and setting and premise.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut please take my ideas with a grain of salt, because I don't have anyone nearby to play any of these games I love reading about. :-)  Everyone just wants to play D&amp;D 4E around here.

The Philosopher's Stone is a variant of Blood Red Sands, which I think of as Ralph's next generation Universalis.  My doc has a link to BRS as well.<br/><br/>--- EDIT ---<br/>So this ended up really long winded.  Here's a smaller summary:<br/><br/>TPS is a competitive, party-based role playing game based on Blood Red Sands, where the players compete for victory points, the position of GM changes hands frequently, and the players play NPCs in addition to their PC.  So when the party encounters a group of trolls and the trolls have an argument about who to eat first, it's the players really having an argument about which one of their characters the trolls try to eat first.<br/>--- END OF EDIT: ORIGINAL POST FOLLOWS ---<br/><br/>Like Universalis, TPS is genre-neutral; you collaborate to create the story as you go and it can take place in any setting.  Like Blood Red Sands, it's competitive and the position of GM shifts around.  So at any given time there is a GM who is just one of the other players that you're "competing against".  I'm not sure how important those victory points will end up being in the end, but that's the framework, anyway.  You gain victory points by "devastating" traits (i.e. "damaging" things, although this can be social, mental, profession, or whatever) and by achieving or countering objectives (countering an objective steals the VPs for yourself).  Play happens in an "adventure party" model, so even though the players are competing, the player characters are (supposedly) cooperating.  Players have a player character (with items, servants, animals, etc.) and "story components", which are NPCs, traps, hazards, etc.  They can use their story components to attack other players' characters while still having their character be friendly.  There is a dice economy that allows the Narrator and the players to create things during play.  The Narrator can attempt to nerf the other players to hinder their ability to gain victory points (or just to be evil).  The players can "challenge" the fiction the Narrator creates and they can also attempt to "contest" for the Narrator position.  As in D&amp;D, players can attack NPCs/monters/etc. with their characters whenever they want.  Also, since players control the story components, they can use their NPCs/monsters/etc. to attack the other PCs.  When a group of orcs argues in the story, they're probably controlled by different players and the players are probably actually trying to achieve conflicting goals with those orcs.  The player can get VPs from using his PC to attack someone else's story components or from using his story components to attack someone else's components.<br/><br/>Here's how play works:<br/><br/>1) first, the players collaborate to define a "mission" by choosing an "objective" and naming the "acts"<br/><br/>2) at the start of a play session, players bid for the initial position of Narrator (GM).  The initial Narrator chooses the act and frames the first scene: time, place, participants<br/><br/>3) during a scene, story telling is like in D&amp;D, with narrative control shifting between the current Narrator and the other players, the Narrator controlling the environment and having ultimate veto power (unless another player is able to take control of the Narrator position) and the players each playing their characters and story components.  The difference here is that the Narrator is usually not the only one controlling NPCs.  As with Blood Red Sands' "pain", the Narrator can give dice to players in exchange for "disasters", which damage or constrain their components but don't give the Narrator VPs.  Also, as in D&amp;D, things can attack other things.<br/><br/>I haven't had a chance to play test this yet because of my schedule so I'm theorizing with this but since it's heavily based on Blood Red Sands which HAS been play tested, I'm not working in the dark TOO much.  Since the Narrator frames the scenes, I'm imagining that there will probably be scenes with only story components, with only PCs, and with a mix.  Since the players get VPs by using their components to attack the other players' components, I don't really think there is a conflict of interest.  The PCs are supposedly "good guys" so they probably will only be engaging in combat with the story components, but story components may be fighting other story components.<br/><br/>There is an implicit conflict of interest for the Narrator, but that's kind of the point.  The Narrator has some incentive to cause disasters to nerf the players, but this is balanced by BRS' challenge and contest mechanics if it gets too bad.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267864/#Comment_267864" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-19T16:48:54+00:00" title="April 19, 2010  4:48PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 19, 2010 4:49PM by J_Walton.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Honestly, I think part of the problem is that a lot of folks don't find playing Universalis to be that satisfying in practice.  Like, everybody can agree that it's a really important game for setting out certain ideas very explicitly, but it doesn't actually get a whole lot of play in this community, based on the experiences I've had going to cons and talking about games with people.  It's really cool that you played a whole bunch of it and had a great time, but I don't think that's the norm.<br/><br/>Universalis cultivates a kind of bounded antagonism between the players which a lot of people find problematic or unsatisfying. You're supposed to kind of fight the other players for control of the story, using the limited resources at your disposal, and that often doesn't lead to a better story or a great dynamic at the table.  I think lots of folks would rather there be strictly defined roles for various players -- whether a traditional GM-player division or something more unusual like Polaris or rotating GM duties -- which allows for clearer duties and methods in cooperating, rather than hashing everything out in play by spending points.  I also think the kind of all-OOC approach to play -- despite having some contemporaries in that timeline game that Ben Robbins is developing and some others -- puts many people off, who want to have a stronger and more personal, experiential connection to characters and bits of setting.<br/><br/>That said, those are just the perceptions I've heard and felt, so it's possible that long-term Universalis play wouldn't end up that way.  It doesn't help, I think, that the original examples in the book -- illustrated in the art -- were mish-mash settings instantly generated on the fly (that was a popular technique at the time, see Primetime Adventures and other contemporaries), clearly the result of conflicting ideas and play priorities that were smashed together.<br/><br/>I also think that Universalis and some of the other more experimental games have influenced later designs in significant ways.  Going that far in an extreme direction enabled us to have certain conversations about what play is, what the social contract between players is, and the like that would be much harder otherwise.  Also, while it's hard to say that In A Wicked Age was influenced by Universalis, it definitely mixes "storytelling" and "roleplaying" (in the way you mean, I think) in a fashion totally different from Universalis.  Lots of folks are interested in games that have a more "storytelling" feel, but most of those have been experiments produced for game design contests and not printed games or even finalized informally published works.  Or they are inspired by storytelling but not by the competitive orientation that Ralph took in Universalis.<br/><br/>In any case, that's what I think is basically what's going on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wburdick" title="wburdick"><img alt="wburdick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wburdick">wburdick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267888/#Comment_267888" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-20T00:59:12+00:00" title="April 20, 2010 12:59AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2010 1:05AM by wburdick.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Antogonism:</b> Interesting.  Antagonism never occurred to us in our Universalis play.  Actually, in our long campaign, we never used the complication mechanics much at all.  We all cooperated to make the RPG story cooler.  I'm hoping this is what will happen when I finally get to run a campaign in TPS.<br/><br/><b>Mish-mash settings:</b> I agree that pure Universalis will usually lead to this because of the way it handles creating the tenets and I've had several Universalis sessions that ended up like that.  This did <b>not</b> happen in my campaign, because we (I and the other GM) seeded the tenets, which included a nice gimmick that gave us veto power (which we almost never ended up using).  BRS also "seeds the tenets" by defining the setting (although there aren't really tenets in BRS) and completely avoids setting mish-mash, I think.  BRS has a VERY good setting.  It's visceral and pithy, AND it's still malleable and Universalisy -- you can change whatever you want, but Ralph even uses the way he describes the rules themselves to convey the spirit of the setting; it's really fun to read.  Here's an example:\n<blockquote>You win the Spoils when you win a Clash, as if true<br/>warriors needed another reason to ravage their enemies.<br/>What are the Spoils? Are they jewels? Piles of gold?<br/>Chests of treasure? Nonsense. Spoils are Pain. When<br/>you win a Clash you get to inflict more Pain, what could<br/>be better?</blockquote>\nActually, I made a couple <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=17949.msg189751" rel="nofollow">posts</a> about making prepackaged settings on the Universalis list in late 2005 and that was apparently the plan at the start, but then they viewed it as unnecessary.  Now, Ralph has done a fantastic job with what's essentially a prepackaged Universalis setting in BRS.  One <b>very important</b> change that BRS makes that I hadn't noticed until just now is that facts are free -- you only pay for traits, control, and "inflicting pain" (affecting other players' stuff).  I think this will make the flow a lot faster.<br/><br/>I'm figuring that what will happen with TPS is that a player will sort of assume the role of GM before a mission (i.e. campaign) and create or choose a setting, "seeding the tenets" beforehand, like BRS does with its setting.  There are so many really good and well researched setting books out there and you can use absolutely any of them with TPS.<br/><br/><b>Strictly defined roles:</b> I agree with this to a great extent.  Personally, some of the things I love about being a player in RPGs are:\n<ul><li>All of the players get to play the same character and grow it from session-to-session<br/></li><li>The players (mostly) cooperate in the story toward a common goal</li></ul>\nSo, I tried to keep this "role playing" property in TPS.  I think BRS is already built for this, anyway, with the contest mechanic -- MOST of the time, people are playing their hero character or their faction.  This is true even when they are the Chronicler, because the BRS mechanics require some of the Chronicler's components to be present at any scene they frame.<br/><br/>I really like Universalis' shared story telling since that worked so well with my group but the way we did it, the only people on control of the story were those who were inspired with ideas and we riffed off each other a lot -- there was <b>absolutely no</b> feeling of antagonism.  One thing that was different from normal role play, of course, was that the current story teller was usually the only one talking -- not much role playing.  I changed the normal flow of play from what Universalis and BRS describe to be more like a "normal" role playing game -- players have default narrative control (like in D&amp;D); when the Narrator is not talking, people can just role play their characters and say what they are doing.  The Narrator, however, can preempt actions and take over at any time (like in D&amp;D).  One thing that's very different from D&amp;D is that the NPC are all divided up between the players, so they play the NPCs too (as in the troll example).<br/><br/>In my campaign, Universalis was confined to the start and, a lot of times, the end of each session.  I'd like to see if we can blend it all together and have the really creative stuff during the whole session.  I'm figuring that the players will smile and nod toward the VPs and competition and actually focus more on the story.  That's how I'm guessing play will unfold with my group, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wburdick" title="wburdick"><img alt="wburdick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wburdick">wburdick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267889/#Comment_267889" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-20T01:29:46+00:00" title="April 20, 2010  1:29AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For reference, <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=0An2MRkbkRMqbcEd1TDdTY2NNRWFNUnRBSDdMTXhQYkE&amp;hl=en&amp;output=html" rel="nofollow">here</a> are a lot of the logs from my campaign that combined Universalis and the PDQ/FATE mashup, so you can see how things went.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267895/#Comment_267895" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-20T06:15:49+00:00" title="April 20, 2010  6:15AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have been working on a system that mashes ideas from Universalis with an otherkind dice system.

Other players can use a in game currency to modify aspects of the world around that character primarily by taking control of NPCs or adding aspects to the situation. I like the way it provides story in a setting and the way players can more easily direct the pace and theme of their characters story. It doesn't play troup based stories very well. I don't have a written rules set at the moment but I will see if I can pull something together for you if you want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wburdick" title="wburdick"><img alt="wburdick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wburdick">wburdick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267902/#Comment_267902" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-20T07:11:32+00:00" title="April 20, 2010  7:11AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting, BRS is pretty chart-driven for constructing ordeals and from what I've heard, Robots and Rapiers has something like that, but I've never seen it.

Walton<br/><br/>We did play a bunch of pure Universalis games and they didn't feel antagonistic in the least, even though there were plenty of complications.<br/><br/>What you listed there did apply to our mashup, however, which is where we didn't end up doing complications very much.  Mostly I think it was because the players wanted to use the RPG mechanics for that.  We did do a few complications, one of which you can see in <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=0An2MRkbkRMqbcEd1TDdTY2NNRWFNUnRBSDdMTXhQYkE&amp;hl=en&amp;gid=0" rel="nofollow">Benn Jordan's sheet</a> in the log.  But given that we started each role playing session with maybe 20 minutes of Universalis and then went into PDQ/FATE, we definitely weren't playing pure Universalis in the mashup.  What Universalis did for us, by the way, was to create sort of interactive cut scenes, where the players had freedom to mess with the NPCs' motivations and parts of the story line that didn't necessarily directly involve their characters.<br/><br/>Universalis actually can, however, be legitimately played without ever rolling dice.  It's totally up to the current person with control, whether or not to create complications -- they can always just take over a component and spend coins to add/modify/remove traits.  That choice is always there and it's just up to the whim of the person in control which way to go on that.  Complications do generate coins but players can set the refresh rate as high as they want before they play and you can always create a gimmick to provide more coins if you want to, so you don't really <b>need</b> to use complications.  There's really not that much to incent players to create complications, in our experience, except if it makes sense to have a battle in the story.  I don't really think removing complications from Universalis actually needs to change it that much.  I don't think it affects how freeform it is, for instance.  To me, the coin-based economy is the real the heart of Universalis.  Actually, I wonder if there really is a "playing" of Universalis, because it's so fluid <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> -- we didn't care, we just had fun and made some great stories.<br/><br/>In some ways, I consider BRS to be a next-gen Universalis, but in other ways, it's a very different animal.  For one thing, you can really say it's a "game" because it's competitive and there is a clear winner.  BRS has <i>crystal clear</i> incentive to clash (create complications). I think these comparisons are fairly complete but I could be leaving some things out:<br/><br/>In BRS and Universalis:\n<ul>\n<li>Facts (called fiction <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> )<br/></li><li>Components<br/></li><li>Traits<br/></li><li>Challenge<br/></li><li>Contest<br/></li><li>Complications (clashes)<br/></li></ul>\nOnly in BRS:\n<ul>\n<li>Fiction is free<br/></li><li>No refresh (i.e. no additional dice at the start of a scene)<br/></li><li>You can't take over components<br/></li><li>No rules for gimmicks<br/></li><li>Dice instead of coins and they are used to influence scene presence, contest to become the Chronicler, inflict pain (if you are the Chronicler), and purchase new traits and components<br/></li><li>A hard limit on the number of traits for each component (usually 4, sometimes 6 or more) and once a trait is devastated, that slot is unusable for the rest of the ordeal, although if the hero makes a vow, the hero component regains all devastated slots<br/></li><li>A trait is "powered" by a die -- without a die, a trait cannot enter the story.

Although, I do want to play BRS pretty badly, and if I ever get a chance I think I would be able to recomment with more perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you are seeing genuine potential from this marriage of systems, but I kind of raise an eyebrow at the goal.  Your purpose is to find the "philosopher's stone" of role-playing, and in doing so I think you miss an important point; one I believe is made strongly by the game you most want to model TSP from, no less.  Here is what sticks out to me:<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't think this:<br/>\n"it's a pan-genre role playing game which covers any genre; fantasy, space, cyberpunk, psi, candyland, fae, dreamlands, western, horror... you name it"<br/>\n<br/>\nWill fit with this:<br/>\n"it's about a party of allies that help each other, but it still allows players to be VP-greedy, despite the mostly good actions of their PCs"<br/>\n"characters cooperating to succeed in missions while their players create the story and compete for victory points"<br/>\n"missions (analogous to BRS Sagas) are composed of acts (analogous to BRS ordeals)"<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason that Sagas and Ordeals fit so well for BRS is precisely because it has the theme and premise it does.  Ralph could have left the theme out and basically made the game you are trying to make, but it would lose its heart.  And a lot of the games that inspired BRS (Ralph lists them all in a bibliography) have the same element: mechanics that marry the game's premise.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that's the part I would have hard time accepting about the game.  It's not that you're using bad rules, or that you want to marry what you call "role-playing" and "story-telling", or even that you think BRS is a good model to be inspired by.  I just don't see the purpose of it.  I would rather play BRS because it's clear that its purpose is to be "A competitive, in your face, testosterone fueled role playing experience in a brutal, over the top, desolate world of savagery and dark sorcery." and it looks to be (remember, I haven't played yet) strongly backed by the rules and setting.  From what you're offering, I don't really know what I'm getting.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that make any sense?  Maybe I have gotten too picky after playing almost exclusively d20 in the past, but I don't really get a hard-on for toolbox game any more.  I bought Universalis because I lusted after the rules (and I think a lot of its ideas still have unrealized potential) but my first session never left me jazzed to play it again. [Edit:  Ah, another way I might say is this: you seem to be trying to make a Universalis 2.0 (Trust me, BRS is definitely not) and I have no desire to play a Uni 2.0.  Its mechanics don't need to be married to other, more traditional RPG mechanics _just for the sake of it_ -- that wouldn't make an interesting game to me.  But I have to agree that, if everything else (premise, setting, etc) were mixed in with the right "seasonings", then YES, I say full steam ahead with putting those kinds of mechanics together.]<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I promise this doesn't come from the fact that I've been tossing around a game for the last three years with the same name ;-)  I'm not sold on the name, and I have no idea when I'm really going to feel confident about what my game's purpose is.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- John M.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wburdick" title="wburdick"><img alt="wburdick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wburdick">wburdick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268006/#Comment_268006" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-20T23:02:13+00:00" title="April 20, 2010 11:02PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2010 11:02PM by wburdick.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fair enough, I agree that BRS is an awesome game just by itself.<br/><br/>But what <b>I think</b> I'm trying to do with TPS is to improve on what I did with my campaign, <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=0An2MRkbkRMqbcEd1TDdTY2NNRWFNUnRBSDdMTXhQYkE&amp;hl=en&amp;gid=2" rel="nofollow">A Memory Can Die</a>.  We had a blast combining FATE/PDQ with Universalis.  I believe it was more fun than just FATE/PDQ or Universalis by themselves and that it was because we could play it like a "normal" role playing game and we could also use Universalis to collaborate on the whole story.  As GMs, it was pretty cool seeing the players improve on our ideas and take the story in directions we hadn't expected.<br/><br/>The players didn't get to peek at our notes, so they were feeling around in the dark a lot.  This is part of what was cool.  Because of the imperfect communication, the players "misunderstood" where we were going sometimes.  Sometimes, their understanding was cooler than what we had planned, so we went with that.  I think this is the "norm" in Universalis and, hopefully, will be in TPS.  I think that imperfect communication naturally leads to unexpected and cool developments in the story.<br/><br/>So, I wouldn't say it's "just for the sake of it," but rather that I had an intuition that they would combine well and it went better than I had hoped for.  Now, I'm just following my intuition again <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>.<br/><br/>Also, I think there's great potential to prepackage or adapt settings or games for use with the basic system behind BRS, which is what I'm trying to do with TPS.  Actually, I consider BRS to be a prepackaged setting + game based on the system behind BRS <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>.  By exploring other game frameworks, I get to not only try to improve on my past game experience with that campaign, but potentially be the first of a lot of game writers to use or riff off of the BRS system.<br/><br/>Actually, now that I'm talking about this, I'm psyched to continue the campaign to its conclusion, but using TPS instead of our mashup...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
