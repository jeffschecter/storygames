Ben Lehman was nice enough to send me a (really exhaustive!) script he'd written up for demo-ing Polaris as cons, which I've mostly cannibalized to write my own script for a TABAW demo.<br/><br/>I think it's good, but realistically I have no experience with writing demos; I've written tons of scripts for science museum demonstrations, but that's a whole different kettle of fish. So really, I don't know. Is it too long? Too vague? Too specific? Too something else?<br/><br/>If there's anyone who wouldn't mind taking a look at my demo script, it would be appreciated if I could get some feedback.

That said, I think you might be trying to put too much into the demo.  From my experience with demos at the booth, your goal is convey the feel of the game rather than the full experience.  Although you want to showcase the most interesting mechanics and highlight the fun, a good demo is often just an abstract of the full game.  <br/><br/>Assuming that you're interested in keeping the demo short (15 minutes or so), I'd suggest making the introduction as brief and punchy as possible, and then get right to the action.  The sooner you get your players using phrases and making choices the better.  <br/><br/>Also, keep in mind that you might want other folks at the booth to be able to run your demo, so writing it without assuming the reader is familiar with the full game might be an advantage.<br/><br/>FWIW, I think Jason did a nice job with the <i>Grey Ranks</i> demo - if you're interested in more inspiration, you can <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/grey_ranks/demo/grey_ranks_demo_final.pdf" rel="nofollow">read the PDF</a> or watch a couple of jackasses <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLLqdXW3ok" rel="nofollow">run through the demo</a> on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSIDm6mQIeQ" rel="nofollow">video</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_160023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160023/#Comment_160023" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-31T04:31:46+00:00" title="July 31, 2008  4:31AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Anna, <br/><br/>Are you aiming for a fifteen minute demo?  That seems like it would take longer than that to me.  Also, nobody gets to really <i>do </i>anything until three quarters of the way through that.  Is it vitally necessary for them to make up their own dudes?  Would it work if you just handed them characters, gave them the 20 second overview of the game's premise, and began in medias res, explaining things as they came up?  <br/><br/>If it were me, I'd want them to walk away with an appreciation of the elegant way characters interact and interrelate, with ritual phrases and how scenes are resolved, and with the history of the period and how that promotes awesome play, very broadly and in that order.  They will see how characters are made intuitively, by playing them.  I think you could be much more direct about hitting the things you think are critical to informing and exciting them, whatever you decide they are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek" title="wundergeek"><img alt="wundergeek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_g1t5HfNJ47o/TJeoZAeG69I/AAAAAAAAAfQ/clp1K8KZ75o/s400/domo-avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek">wundergeek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160036/#Comment_160036" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-31T07:06:59+00:00" title="July 31, 2008  7:06AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason and Steve:<br/><br/>Thanks for your comments.

I've been stopwatched. Because the base of it (the Polaris version) is very, very, very wordy, specifying things like exactly what you say where, it looks longer than it is, particularly the opening part. In words, it's like 3/4s set-up, 1/4 play. In practice, it's about 1/3 2/3rds. That said, if you can't get the opening part under 5 minutes, yes, there's a problem.<br/><br/>I think you're going to hit a serious road-block in the "pick an office" stuff you have there. Picking aspects seems to hang people.<br/><br/>The thing about writing things down: my experience is that a pre-made character bored people, they didn't engage, and they just fucked around, which is death to the game. Apparently the actual act of writing a name from a list onto a piece of paper is sufficient create creative investment. But my sample size is not large: I used pre-gens, it was dull, I tried using sped-up char-gen, it was much, much better.<br/><br/>That said, I think TABAW might be different (it's historical and deeply tied into modern events.) So maybe people will be able to engage without that creative act.<br/><br/>Conversely, I'm not sure that your scenario is "poppy" enough to deal with the problems you're going to have. The primary obstacle to engagement that you're going to have is people's stereotypes about Muslims, and that they'll enact their stereotypes in a posturing and derisive way. If any player (of the three) does this, your demo is dead in the water. I think that the only way to get by this is to have a really intense human scenario, something that will instantly grab them by the human parts and bypass the racism-bearing bits. The problem is that my default for doing this (sex, marriage, and children) is intimately tied into Western stereotypes about Muslims. So you're in a pickle there.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160039/#Comment_160039" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-31T07:35:45+00:00" title="July 31, 2008  7:35AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 31, 2008 7:36AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I defer to Ben's experience here.  I do think pre-gens could go a long way toward obviating issues of stereotyping.  You could sort of control for that and educate the player a tiny bit, too.  I bet people interested enough to try TABAW out will invest enough to make it work.  <br/><br/>What about giving each participant one clear goal that demonstrates an Islamic value?  "Your guy is a knight of the Caliphate, and as such he's required to show these miscreants hospitality.  Above all things, you want them treated well and the peace kept within your walls."  That sort of thing.  Pick mutually exclusive ones, of course.  Pretend you are Luke Crane.  The fact that the setting is unique (to us) and the values quite different is very appealing, so showing that off is a good thing in my mind.  I recognize that this might be too much for 15 minutes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_160044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arturo%20G." title="Arturo G."><img alt="Arturo G." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arturo%20G.">Arturo G.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160044/#Comment_160044" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-31T08:21:38+00:00" title="July 31, 2008  8:21AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experience with a much longer demo of Polaris in a convention was that, as Ben comments, you need to leave some chargen for the players to get engaged. <br/><br/>But Ben is right.

Once they say, 'oh, I'm Commander of the Army' or 'I'm totally the Emir's only Heir!' something clicks and a lot of that awkwardness goes away. So I'd like to keep it if there's a good way to make it not too awkward, because it will make things a hundred times better.<br/><br/>Also, I have more to say about the situation.

Now that I have some more time...<br/><br/>Basically my goal with establishing the situation the way I did was to touch on the Islamic-ness of the situation without expecting people to try and play out Traditional Muslim Values - because while you can get into that stuff in a real game I think it would kill a demo really damn quickly. So I went with an assassination attempt on the emir* in the emir's own palace - since I felt like it evoked the context of the setting. I then tried to make the situation more general by framing it in terms that anyone would be able to relate to - things that don't require an understanding of Muslim cultural values - so that players would have an immediate reaction and not feel paralyzed by "I Have To Do This Correctly" syndrome, or even worse play out all kinds of horrible stereotypes and kill the demo.<br/><br/>*my husband asked me 'why not just have the emir be dead?' and I was like, 'duuuhhhhh, good point?'.<br/><br/>So the situation I created boils down to 'Your best friend is about to be apprehended for the murder of your national leader under suspicious circumstances. They claim they're innocent, and you are in a position to affect the situation. What do you do?'. It might not be the punchiest scenario ever, but I'm really, really, REALLY trying to avoid having my demo turn into a violence-fest every time I run it. To be sure, a lot of violence happens in TABAW, but I don't want to have it go to the bad place and have people walk away going 'man, that game portrays Muslims as stereotypically violent', because that would suck. A lot.<br/><br/>All of this is a hell of a lot of baggage to bring to creating a demo, which is why I appreciate second opinions.

Then depending on whether the character is Muladi or Arab, say "so how about we use 'Heir of the Emir' as his office" or "so how about we use 'captain of the watch' as his office?"<br/><br/>And have a scenario for each office. I like the idea of having the Muladi watchcaptain, say, catch his Christian younger brother involved in petty theft of food.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_160099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek" title="wundergeek"><img alt="wundergeek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_g1t5HfNJ47o/TJeoZAeG69I/AAAAAAAAAfQ/clp1K8KZ75o/s400/domo-avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek">wundergeek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160099/#Comment_160099" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-31T13:24:49+00:00" title="July 31, 2008  1:24PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben,<br/><br/>That might be a better way of going about it.
