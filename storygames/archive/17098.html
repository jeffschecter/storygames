Think Dark Shadows (the original TV show, not the Johnny Depp movie) and you've got the idea. I may have bitten off more than I can chew because it involves stunt dice, but I went ahead and made the stunt dice an optional rule. I also tried to keep the basic rules for using the stunt dice as succinct as possible, cutting out a bunch of the fluff and either removing it totally or putting it at the end as an appendix for those looking for more details.<br/><br/>I've already gotten some great feedback on an earlier draft of this playset over on Boardgame Geek; I've put a lot of that feedback to use during my last round of edits. But I would like even more feedback if anyone is willing, particularly those of you who have more familiarity with Fiasco than I do.<br/><br/>Here's a link: <a href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B0Ut5mF-spZyZ1pnTXUxRFFxOTg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B0Ut5mF-spZyZ1pnTXUxRFFxOTg</a><br/><br/>(This is my first time using Google Docs, so I'm hoping I set the permissions correctly. Also, you'll notice there is no art -- sorry, but I am not artistic!)<br/><br/>Next up, I'd like to try something much simpler. I am thinking a 20-year high-school reunion.

I have everything stored up as layers, so if you'd like something tweaked I could totally do that.<br/>I have twoversions of the piece.<br/>1) The piece when I finished working. <a href="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b330/maxdxam/StonefalconManorCoverArtLarge-2.png" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b330/maxdxam/StonefalconManorCoverArtLarge-2.png</a><br/>I also have a half-size of this one: <a href="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b330/maxdxam/StonefalconManorCoverArtSmall-2.png" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b330/maxdxam/StonefalconManorCoverArtSmall-2.png</a><br/>2) Unfortunately, I realized you're probably gonna need this to fit on a letter sized page, and that one doesn't scale to letter sized pages very gracefully. So this one I ungracefully scaled and then tried to clean up. This is likely the most usable one - it's the same dimension ratio as letter, but halved on each axis (so it's technically 1/4 the area of a letter-size sheet, but it will scale pretty well). <a href="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b330/maxdxam/StonefalconManorhalfletter-1.png" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b330/maxdxam/StonefalconManorhalfletter-1.png</a><br/><br/>How'd I do?

There wasn't one in 1969. I think if you want 50s to 70s it's probably best to say so. The UK did change massively over this period so there's going to be a very different feel.

Also, it's usually either a pub or an inn (the words are pretty much synonymous now) and Bayside isn't an English pub name (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub_names" rel="nofollow">here</a> for some ideas).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jda1974" title="jda1974"><img alt="jda1974" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jda1974">jda1974</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388294/#Comment_388294" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-26T08:45:12+00:00" title="August 26, 2012  8:45AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is incredibly helpful.

Now that I've narrowed it down, that car thing may not make much sense. I want the village to be very remote and behind the times relative to other villages of the time -- but that may be pushing it. Perhaps I could instead make a statement about a few homes finally puchasing televisions? "It\u2019s 1965, and the times are slowly catching up with the quaint English village by the bay. Several homes now own televisions, and the maidens hemlines have begun to rise just as their neckline begin to plunge."<br/><br/>Re: psychiatrist -- Doesn't seem that modern to me, but I'm open to other ideas. Do you think "psychologist" would be better? I admit to being strongly influenced by the Dr. Hoffman character in the original Dark Shadows, my main inspiration for this playset. <br/><br/>Re: harlot vs. prostitute -- I considered that, but the character doesn't necessarily have to charge for her services. Would something like "tramp" work better? <br/><br/>Re: sabre -- D'oh! Thanks!<br/><br/>Re: gramophone vs. phonograph -- My research (OK, I looked on Wikipedia <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> ) makes it sounds like those two names were used almost identically for two devices by rival manufacturers. Do you think "gramophone" was more appropriate for the U.K.?<br/><br/>Re: Expose myself to the village maiden -- Yeah, I don't love the wording on that one. I really want a Need that reflects a caddish character trying to seduce an innocent girl, which seems appropriate for this type of story. What about "To expose the naive maiden to debaucherous pleasures"? That's perhaps a bit broader than just "seduction," but it's close enough and doesn't make it sound so much like I just want a character to be a flasher! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Thanks again!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jda1974" title="jda1974"><img alt="jda1974" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jda1974">jda1974</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388336/#Comment_388336" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-26T18:37:29+00:00" title="August 26, 2012  6:37PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and "Pebbleton" just sounded like an interesting word.

The main issue about ownership after that is about coverage. Other indicators of remoteness might be the number of working horses in the fields, taking foreign holidays, the presence of teenagers, drinking coffee, fashion (mods, rockers etc).<br/><br/>I think gramophone is slightly more appropriate for the UK.
