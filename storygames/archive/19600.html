I love each character having One Unique Thing. I love the backgrounds instead of skills. I love the escalation die. I love the Icons and relationship rolls. I love all the quirky flavor that the default setting has. I love simplified combat with fixed monster damage. I love magic items with personalities. HOWEVER: I do not love the character classes, though they're fun. I do not love the complexity of the game, though it's only slightly more baroque than I am seeking. I do not love the math behind the skill system, or the actual mechanics for icon relationship rolls. I do not actually love the 13th Age setting (though it's growing on me).<br/><br/>So far, I am really liking D&amp;D 5e, though I haven't played it yet. I'm playing it two or three times this weekend. Based on my own analysis and that of others smarter about such things (like Rob Donoghue), I think this system is exactly what I'm seeking. Except it's missing all the cool stuff I love about 13th Age.<br/><br/>No problem! The 13th Age rules themselves tell you, <i>hey, even if you don't play this game, steal its ideas for your other game</i>. So I'll probably play 5e for a while to give it a chance as-is and then start grafting on 13th Age ideas.<br/><br/>Ideas that are easily transported from 13th Age in to D&amp;D 5:<br/><br/>* One Unique Thing. Is there any reason each D&amp;D character can't just have One Unique Thing, as long as it isn't an explicit combat ability? <br/>* Backgrounds. The skill system in 5e isn't all that interesting. It really doesn't hurt that much, I think, to drop in backgrounds instead. They're far more /interesting/.<br/>* Icons. Any setting can have icons. Characters are the main tool for Icons to break out of their equilibrium. Now PCs make a difference. Now PCs have relationships to the setting in a tangible way. Just import some kind of a Success/Success with Trouble/Failure roll, even if it's the same, weird 1d6 roll 13th Age uses.<br/>* Quirky Magic Items. Every magic item has a personality. You attune to the magic item, and that makes you take on some of its personality traits.<br/>* Escalation Die. At the very least, just use it as a straight-up combat accelerator. There won't be any D&amp;D tricks that use the escalation die, but that's okay. Much faster combats.<br/>* Fixed Monster Damage. I think this might already be a 5e rule (maybe optional). Just average damage (5d6 damage becomes 18 damage) and use that number. Much faster combats.<br/>* Zones / Ranges / Engagement. 13th Age has some elegant rules for engagement, adjacency, and zoned ranges. Movement is freeform and mostly Theater of the Mind. I think this is pretty compatible with 5e. The 13th Age classes are built pretty heavily around this stuff, so who knows how well this transports without those class talents. I'll need to play around with this one.<br/><br/>Here are some house rules I'll probably use, too. They are not actually from 13th Age, but I wouldn't have come up with them without 13th Age suggesting certain ideas:<br/><br/>* Simplified Damage for PCs. Fighters do 1d10 (1d8 ranged) with their main weapon. Clerics do 1d8 (1d6 ranged). Rogues do 1d6 (1d8 ranged, 1d8 with a dagger). Wizards do 1d4 (1d6 ranged). Want to play a wizard with a sword? Fine, 1d4 damage. Want to be a fighter with a knife? 1d10 damage. Actual choices for dice need to be playtested and tweaked.<br/>* Activating Magic Items. As you level up, if you get more than a couple magic items, it's hard to play all their personalities. Each magical power comes with a personality quirk and has a checkbox next to it. Role-play that quirk, check the box. At the end of an adventure session (or maybe long rest), uncheck all the boxes.<br/><br/>What things do you want to transport from 13th Age into D&amp;D 5th Edition?<br/><br/><br/>* I'm really not religious. This just amused me. Also, if you're transporting 5e ideas back into 13th Age, I think we should call that NextAge.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435560/#Comment_435560" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-21T12:06:10+00:00" title="July 21, 2014 12:06PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 21, 2014 12:08PM by catty_big.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            5:13 eh?

Terrific stuff! Found that it allowed me to give my imagination free range within the confines of a product labeled Dungeons &amp; Dragons.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm totally using some 13th Age-isms with 5e. Certainly these:<br/><br/> - Icons (not exactly sure on the mechanism yet)<br/> - One Unique Thing<br/><br/>I like 13th Age's Backgrounds but... but...5e has their own versions of Backgrounds which does two things: gives me some degree of crunch with regards to skill use (it dictates proficiencies which I like and it keeps that D&amp;D flavor for me) but also allows for further narrative implication. That is, I'm more than willing to allow Advantage on other rolls (skills or not) if the influence of the character's Background can be justified by the player. In other words, for me, it's not broke and I don't want to fix it.<br/><br/>Escalation Die -- hmm. Not sure. 5e does a nice job of minimizing bonuses and penalties you have to add up; while I like the notion of the ED as a pacing mechanic, it also gives adds another (tiny) bit of math to combat. And 5e combat is already feeling quick and fluid to me. Without all the PC and Monster abilities that are tied to ED, I'm not sure if ED gives me all that much.<br/><br/>Fixed Monster Damage -- yea, love it. Not sure if 5e officially has this as an option but all the monster stat blocks in the Starter Set give fixed damage (and hp) as an option.<br/><br/>Zones -- I would love to try to make these work with 5e. If there's one thing about 5e that I'm not impressed with, it's that movement and ranges aren't all that different from how they've been done in the past.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's all my 3 cents.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435582/#Comment_435582" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-21T17:06:54+00:00" title="July 21, 2014  5:06PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Anyway, that's all my 3 cents.</blockquote>\nPower creep!!!! :-)<br/><br/>In seriousness:<br/><br/>Agree with you about the ED not being a good fit for 5E, and about 5E's Backgrounds seeming neat in their own right.

Everyone can see it on the table, so it's not hard to apply or reference. It's not like a player will be hunting over her character sheet looking for feat bonuses. <br/><br/>Skill systems are generally broken for me because they don't cover everything and can't. I want a way for a player to say, "Hey, I am not an expert in diplomacy in any way, but I'm actually really good at making deals with thieves, because I spent a lot of time as a merchant in Drakkenhall and that's how deals get done there." Backgrounds do that pretty handily. (At the same time, smart players make characters good at everything and you need to curb that gently.)<br/><br/>How 'bout One Unique Thing?

I'd say the Infravision is a borderline rules violation.<br/><br/>But as I see it, the OUT works in one of three unique ways: as a mechancial benefit or change that's poorly designed and not well integrated into the game system; as a story aspect that is already represented by other more concrete choices such as class, background, and icon relationships; or as a story aspect that isn't represented by those other more concrete choices.<br/><br/>I feel like that third way is the most common, and it's a big part of why I said the mechanic felt like a rejection of system matters:  You compare it to an aspect in your post, but it's an aspect that can't ever be tagged, which half-defeats the purpose.  More broadly, I think it's a rejection of system matters because it presents these three different choices under the umbrella of a single rule without any attempt to clarify or differentiate.<br/><br/>The game is saying "your character should be cool, so make it cool, but don't worry about how that coolness is supported by the rules.  To my that's a half-step from "don't really worry about the rules, you can have fun with terrible rules as long as you have a good players and/or GM"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435741/#Comment_435741" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-24T07:48:18+00:00" title="July 24, 2014  7:48AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Combat" is the key here.

I like it in the sense that supports player's input to make their characters different to any other character with the same options and stats. If you as a GM consider a third arm or free darkvision too much, it's up to you to say no to the player. But then if the player asks if his character can be the only survival royal guard of a lost elven kingdom in search of his king's son, that's a unique that actually tells me a story. <br/><br/>Again, it's up to the GM to allow that and see how ot fit into the setting and use it once and again to pull the player into certain situations. And also, any unique ability can be turned against the player. You've got a third arm? Ok, now tell me from what kind of freakshow are you running from. You see in the dark?

It's "really now, you might be a peasant farmer gone adventuring, but surely there's something much more interesting about you, something that makes you unique, right?" That's a pretty powerful instruction to a player. It's explicit permission to be special.<br/><br/>Maybe some players never felt they needed that permission.

[i.e. are they m\xeal\xe9e range]\u201d. Things happen when you leave someone\u2019s reach. Things also happen if a monster is in the reach of several people at the same time (if one of those people is the thief).<br/>It\u2019s already great for TotM.<br/>And Adv/Disadv make other weird environmental things also matter.\n<blockquote>* Activating Magic Items.

So the average (sometimes rounded up, sometimes down) is listed first and then a dicey alternative. The rule is that the DM can choose at anytime which of the two to use.<br/>For example if players are metagaming against the number 5, like \u201cI have 6 hitpoints, I\u2019ll engage with it\u201d then the DM can say \u201cWell, actually...\u201d and use the 1d6+2. And if the monster crits, there\u2019s no shortcut. It\u2019s 2d6+2.<br/>But I think the static damages work great! Good idea, 13th Age inventors!<br/><br/>My three suggestions are:<br/>if you like 5e, play 5e. It\u2019s good.<br/>If you like the Icons (I don\u2019t), bring only them into 5e.<br/>If you like 13th Age, play it.

We focus on roleplaying and story as the fundamental core of the game, and always have. Don't need rules or rewards for it, it's already why we're playing. If anything general experience/karma/whatever rewards for characterization and roleplaying work fine in most games (at least traditional ones) as an encouragement to train in the craft. When it forms the entire basis of the game (BW/MG for instance) I have no problem with it. Otherwise it feels like an 'add-on', and detracts from otherwise focused systems. <br/><br/>That being said I'm all for sections of a book that describe and/or guide people through the 'how to' of character creation, storytelling, etc...you know, roleplaying. I think offering the advice of starting with at least one identifying feature, background element or mannerism to help people learn is pretty solid.<br/><br/>In this case I'm definitely opposed to a strict adherence/interpretation as its limiting (just one thing) and self-defeating (you're unique...just like everybody else). What's more, it's unrealistic. We are NOT one thing. What makes us unique is the specific combination, not any single element. In my opinion the 'one unique thing' is the roleplaying equivalent of a soundbyte/ten-word-answer, which (to me) epitomizes the erosion of intellect and civilization.

In pure TotM with zones, I can be all like, "Yeah, so you're a good ways away from the cart. Let's say long range." In D&amp;D 5e, I have to say, "Yeah, so you're a good ways away from the cart. Let's say, 100 feet." And what I really meant to say was, "just outside easy bow range" because my mind doesn't firmly differentiate between 100 feet and 200 feet in any intuitive way.
