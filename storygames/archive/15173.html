Your immersion is rather stronger in those games, in my experience, due to methods created specifically for tapping into just this phenomenon. And maybe due to methods being mechanics-light. Deceptively simple methods give raise to intense and complex interactive drama.<br/><br/>To me it is all a question of letting the game take command of you. So the game takes over by inspiring you to do things "the character way", rather than your own way. It takes place when there's an atmosphere that lets your intuition rule the field, in concord with other players, resulting in a creative mesh of sense, sensibility and imagination. <br/><br/>Those party to these experiences often look at them as pinnacles of great gaming. And no wonder; it is the closest thing to pure ego-transforming magic we have in games (and other media) today.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344878/#Comment_344878" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-04T23:59:52+00:00" title="October  4, 2011 11:59PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Love how you call them modern games ;-)<br/><br/><b>Describe that in detail</b>:  Deceptively simple methods give raise to intense and complex interactive drama.<br/><br/><br/>"It takes place when there's an atmosphere that lets your intuition rule the field, in concord with other players, resulting in a creative mesh of sense, sensibility and imagination.

Where you put Mortal Coil in all this is puzzling and local conditions always make it difficult to generalise.<br/><br/>Going back to Mortal Coil, I've played it as GM, as a player with a GM and as a player in a GM-less game and I've had immersion in all three, even when other players in the same haven't had or sought that type of experience. The most immersive game that I currently pay, in which all players are really engaged through their characters, is AD&amp;D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344894/#Comment_344894" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-05T07:26:55+00:00" title="October  5, 2011  7:26AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 5, 2011 7:27AM by JDCorley.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The only time I've ever had immersion is in LARPs, where I didn't have to imagine how my character's left leg was, I could just use my left leg.

And then he need to give you the tools to work your way into the state of the game. That is; the tools you use to immerse in the interactive system, and to empower your intuition in acting out the character. There's a multitude of ways to do this, as many as the games of yesterday, today and tomorrow, and then some. But all in all; when you succeed, it is the designer of the game, the game itself, your co-players, and your trust in the benignity of the interaction (even when it sharpens), that delivers you.<br/><br/>One very important aspect, though, is how we, the players, support each other by playing our characters <i>to the best of our ability</i>. When all of us do this, "the best of our ability" rise to really great levels. We make each other better players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_345133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345133/#Comment_345133" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-07T01:59:32+00:00" title="October  7, 2011  1:59AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>I actually have an easier time seeing goblins in my head when sitting at a table and tuning out my surroundings than I do when seeing my friend dressed up in a goblin costume.</blockquote>LOL!

To me it is all a question of surrendering your ego to the game-play, so the interaction may inspire you to do things "the character way", rather than your own way. This is true wether you have a GM or not. I am not describing two different ways to the goal, but the same way to the goal, in spite of outside conditions like having a GM or not. What I'm mindful of, is how the players act together to make it possible, and how the game supports them in this.<br/><br/>So what I'm saying is that there is only one way, but a lot of different ways to walk upon it. ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345134/#Comment_345134" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-07T02:24:56+00:00" title="October  7, 2011  2:24AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><br/><br/><cite>Posted By: ivan</cite><b>Describe that in detail</b>:  Deceptively simple methods give raise to intense and complex interactive drama.</blockquote>Oh!

That's trust at a meta-level and trust at a story-level. Many RPG systems, particularly the ones Tomas has labeled "classical," actually foster a mistrustful environment, giving one person undue control over all the characters, and making that same person the final arbiter of your social and narrative safety. <br/><br/>I've been having this conversation (or ones rather like it anyway) on G+ this week because I revealed on my site that Bhaloidam potentially allows for shared control of all characters and certainly requires a high degree of cooperation at a minimum. This led to a lot of excited questions about how the platform keeps this from escalating out of control, how the mechanics support that at a social level, etc.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I see this potential for fostering cooperation as being one of the great strengths of RPGs and table top storytelling games. I even believe it allows the playing of them to have a positive impact on the players' daily lives.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345184/#Comment_345184" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-07T07:47:30+00:00" title="October  7, 2011  7:47AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2011 7:48AM by David_Berg.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>I am not describing two different ways to the goal, but the same way to the goal, in spite of outside conditions like having a GM or not.</blockquote>Oh, okay, that probably makes more sense than the way I was interpreting it anyway.

Common guidelines include--use "yes, and" (i.e. never negate what you're given to work with), keep the focus human and on stage, keep it short (referring to individual lines of dialog), and leave with intention (never just wander off without explanation).<br/><br/>Which brings me to my point--in my experience there are two primary components that leads to immersive role play--<strong>Mastery</strong> and <strong>Agency</strong>. If Spinners feel they not only have freedom to act. but the power to act meaningfully and well, they will likely feel immersed in the experience. Anything that limits their ability to exhibit mastery--whether that's at the mechanics level or the social level--will hamper their feeling of agency and thus immersion.<br/><br/>Yesterday I ran demo for my platform using a one-shot called "The Funeral." This is a pure dialog scene where three estranged adult siblings confront each other after their father's funeral. Each has something they're ashamed of and each has a suspicion about another sibling. It requires some coaching for the first few lines of dialog because it's such a foreign structure for most gamers, but as the scene goes on and the Spinners feel more and more confident in their ability to manage the mechanics and their Performances, they become more and more immersed. It's fascinating to watch happen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_345402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345402/#Comment_345402" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-10T05:33:34+00:00" title="October 10, 2011  5:33AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: CorvusE</cite>I know a lot of actors who would disagree with this interpretation of acting.</blockquote>They would probably say that there's a lot more to it.

So many story games provide too little guidance for timid or inexperienced spinners--tossing them into the flow of story with no maps,no guideposts, and no mechanism by which they can interpret the currents. This is made worse when they play with Spinners who have strong storytelling skills who run roughshod over them in their haste to be the champion explorer.<br/><br/>Bhaloidam is structured to let every Spinner shine to the best of their ability by keeping performance short, focused, and attached to the intuitive visual/kinaesthetic mechanics.<br/><br/>And since they are given complete control over the outcomes of their performances, they are able to feel agency even when sharing in a more guided story experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345459/#Comment_345459" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-10T14:04:23+00:00" title="October 10, 2011  2:04PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/CorvusE">@CorvusE</a><br/><br/>what are the basic mechanics of Bhaloidam? <br/><br/>what do you model? character psychology? skills? story?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CorvusE" title="CorvusE"><img alt="CorvusE" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://zakelro.com/images/hexaCorvus32x.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CorvusE">CorvusE</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345460/#Comment_345460" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-10T14:17:33+00:00" title="October 10, 2011  2:17PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ivan</cite><a href="/forums/profile/CorvusE">@CorvusE</a><br/><br/>what are the basic mechanics of Bhaloidam?</blockquote>\nExerting Will via Influences serves to provide guidance for your performance, which in turn is applied to effect within the scene (spilling Ego, movement, timing, etc).\n<blockquote>what do you model? character psychology? skills? story?</blockquote>\nRelationships.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345624/#Comment_345624" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-11T21:32:29+00:00" title="October 11, 2011  9:32PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh.

Experiencing a flow state, by definition, means that you are performing a difficult task with mastery. (I'm not saying that every time you perform a difficult task with mastery you will enter a flow state. But it's one of the definitional requirements for it.)<br/><br/>That, in particular, can serve as an interesting diagnostic for why people struggle with immersion sometimes.<br/><br/>Often, they struggle because they've changed the activity enough that they are no longer able to perform with mastery. And they haven't given themselves enough time mastering the new activity enough to be able to reach the flow state again.<br/><br/>So trying a new style of tabletop game that's drastically different from what you are used to can cause you not to reach a flow state the first several times you play, because you are still working on gaining mastery of the new game.<br/><br/>Likewise, people who try out larp who haven't given it enough time to really master it often focus on the parts they are unfamiliar with and find those things jarring because they have not mastered them yet.<br/><br/>This is something to consider when looking at how doing something outside your experience and comfort zone affects your "immersion" - your ability to reach a flow state.<br/><br/>As a comparative example that I learned about during English Education classes years ago: While a student is learning a new writing technique, their more basic skills usually degrade for a while because they are focusing on the new part. For example, while learning how to write a formal comparative essay for the first time, a student will often display spelling and grammar mistakes that they would not have made if writing in a form they were more familiar with. As they practice and gain mastery over the new form, their other skills will return and they will stop making mistakes with the words and grammar structures they are familiar with. Also, the general quality of the content will improve, as they gain an understanding of the new form and how best to apply it - for a comparative essay, for example, they well choose better subjects to compare and better details to use in making the comparison.<br/><br/>Mastery comes with time. And mastery with something similar doesn't confer instant mastery with something new.<br/><br/>And, yes, the activity itself can be structured by the designer to make mastery easier to attain. The best game designers do this with their books. And the best GMs (when applicable) do this at their table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345716/#Comment_345716" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-12T15:54:04+00:00" title="October 12, 2011  3:54PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>From what I have seen in most discussions, and this one has not yet proven to be majorly different, immersion is usually code for "experiencing a flow state while roleplaying".</blockquote>\nThat interesting. Because from where I "come from" when it comes to theory, the nordic larp scene, the definition of immersion is quite far away from flow. I recognize there are diffrent types of immersion and how you reach that immersion is an induvidual thing. But flow states is quite well defined and dont overlap at all with a lot of immersive experinces. <br/><br/>Flow (psychology) on wikipedia: <i>"Flow is the mental state of operation in which a person in an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and success in the process of the activity."</i><br/><br/>I want to give to examples of immersions state that clearly different from Flow. <br/><br/>1. Non happy immersion moments. All the time you goes into character immersion when you experience v low feelings; bordom, or being really tired and exhausted, sad, confused or scared all fall far from a flow experiences.<br/><br/>Quoting Wikipedia once more.<i> " In flow, the emotions are not just contained and channeled, but positive, energized, and aligned with the task at hand. To be caught in the ennui of depression or the agitation of anxiety is to be barred from flow. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The hallmark of flow is a feeling of spontaneous joy, even rapture, while performing a task</span>[2] although flow is also described (below) as a deep focus on nothing but the activity \u2013 not even oneself or one's emotions."</i><br/><br/>2. A experiences a lot of immersive larper share is when you reach the point when you reach a point of character immersion when you even dream in-characer dreams, and that quite far from an conscious flow state. You are asleep, but clearly mentally immersed in character. Sleep =/= Flow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345724/#Comment_345724" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-12T16:11:34+00:00" title="October 12, 2011  4:11PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Addendum: </b><br/><br/>To me, with my view of immersion I would actually say that the feeling of "spontaneous joy, even rapture" is at odds at being immersed into the character emotionally* unless the character IC is feeling spontaneous joy, even rapture, over something in-character.

So I addressed some of what you later added before you added it.)<br/><br/>I'm not sure I'd classify dreaming as immersion. Dreaming is processing memories. You're processing your memories of time spent playing/being the character. You're doing the brain-work that humans need to do to transfer medium-term memory into long-term memory. You're remembering game time.<br/><br/>The joy of flow does not negate the possiblity of experiencing crappy low feelings as a character. If you have a really deep negative experience and you came out of it and said "wow, that was awesome" then you experienced both the joy and the pain at the same time (you masochistic little freak <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> ). If you came out of it and didn't feel the joy of having gone through a fascinating experience as your character, then you (the player) were just tired, exhausted, hurt, bored.<br/><br/>My dad's favorite movies are the gut-punchers. The deep, dramatic movies that are drenched in human drama and pain (and sometimes the humor that helps us deal with those things). He's watched Sideways and Pollock about a half dozen times each, though he's not generally a fan of rewatching movies. He loves getting invested in those characters and their pain, though he's probably the least sadistic person I know. But he clearly finds some level of immersive flow-like joy in engaging with those movies. And I've seen players do the same thing in games. <br/><br/>I very much don't think that joy of flow and the pain of immersing in character-driven negativity are mutually exclusive. Quite the opposite, in fact.<br/><br/>I don't know about you, but I'm capable of feeling the joy of flow and the negativity of character-driven angst at the same time. In fact, I rather insist on it. If I'm not feeling the joy, then the angst and negativity knocks me out of my characterization and back into myself in the worst possible way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345745/#Comment_345745" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-12T19:49:11+00:00" title="October 12, 2011  7:49PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there are several types of flow you can get from tabletop roleplay.

Masterful system manipulation can <i>support</i> that -- I know the trait dice strategies so well I don't have to think about them -- but in that case I'd call that mastery secondary to the experience (and probably not what we're talking about if we discuss <i>this</i> flow).  <br/><br/>From the perspective of immersive flow, I'm not sure if there's a difference between masterful narration that incorporates mechanics-use and masterful narration that's freeform.<br/><br/>Oh, wait, I'm not in the "is freeform natural?" thread, am I?

I come from the Nordic tradition, like you Elin, and find that the immersions I've had is neatly covered by this description of flow.<br/><br/>Let me explain:<br/><br/>When deeply engaged in my character, my higher self is experiencing great joy over actually being so profoundly immersed. While I am experiencing great pain or sorrow or anger or fear as my character, I am personally filled with joy too, over the authenticity of my experience. When my character is in love/joy/anticipation, these feelings is also mixed (strengthened) with the joy of my higher self. To me this is extremely rewarding. These "double moments" have a golden shine to them; as if the life of an angry or happy character shines in a glorious brilliance of transparency/insight/understanding. <br/><br/>I's a dual experience of sympathy and empathy:<br/>- I am in <b>sympathy</b> with the character; feeling what it feels; being what it is.<br/>- I am in <b>empathy</b> with the character; seeing what it is and feels; understanding why; perceiving its soul with love.<br/><br/>And the joy stems also from me recognizing that I have lost my control over the character, as in; the character will lead me, making decisions on its own grounds, and I'm willingly following it to the fields of immersive understanding. The moment I loose control, and let the will of the character roam freely, I'm in <i>flow</i>. The flow comes from surrendering myself to the game, making my body and soul into a vehicle for the character.<br/><br/>But my higher self is still in attendance, sprinkling this experience with bright joy from the highest level of my existence.<br/><br/>Love!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345757/#Comment_345757" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-12T23:39:00+00:00" title="October 12, 2011 11:39PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 12, 2011 11:47PM by w176.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>I very much don't think that joy of flow and the pain of immersing in character-driven negativity are mutually exclusive.

I don't see feeling these double level as feelings as anything opposite to feeling immersion and agree to much of what you are saying.<br/><br/>I just wanted to point out that to me what define emotional character immersion is whatever you feel the character feelings or not. Not whatever you get the "high" or a flow. The high might be there. Or it might not be there. But the high of the flow feeling itself doesn't define emotional character immersion.<br/><br/>Let say that you during an intense moment of a game doesn't get the high of the flow, you still really in tune with the characters emotions, let say you feel IC scared. If you still feel IC scared, but don't get the flow high, you are still immersed right? High or not, and no matter if you personalty meed that high to not be pushed OOC, the high isn't what defines immersion to me. Nor does is it to me what defines if the experience will be good or not. Right at that moment I might just feel scared, but I might still appreciate the experience a lot later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_345776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345776/#Comment_345776" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-13T04:40:48+00:00" title="October 13, 2011  4:40AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 13, 2011 4:45AM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: w176</cite>no matter if you personalty meed that high to not be pushed OOC, the high isn't what defines immersion to me.</blockquote>No, of course it is not. <br/><br/>What defines <b>immersion</b>, in a role-playing game, is that you are in deep contact with the character. <br/><br/><b>Flow</b> is a key to understanding how you get into this kind of contact with your character. By keeping in flow, in concord with others, you are easily able to deepen the contact, maintaining it, and enjoying it while doing so.<br/><br/>Playing the character in spontaneous and joyful interaction with other players, allows you to go into the really deep and enjoyable immersive state where <i>you are one with the character</i>. When the whole group go into this state, the game soars.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
