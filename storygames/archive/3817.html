I'm not sure how it would work but it seems really interesting to me.<br/><br/>So you play D&amp;D 3.5, and stat up a tenth level character.  Or you run a traditional campaign until everybody is tenth level, even better.  At that point, a switch flips and all experience you earn becomes negative experience.  You go down levels, lose hit points, are stripped of feats, and eventually become weak and frail again, and then die.   Your character has a tragic arc and, probably, an ignoble end at the hands of a kobold or something.  <br/><br/>One interesting thing about this is that you'd actively try to avoid fighting, since even victory tears you down.  You'd avoid wealth, becoming an ascetic.  The GM's role would be to push conflicts where fighting was<i> worth it, </i>despite the irreversible pain.  With the right kind of set-up, the degeneration could be played as karmic debt, or the burden of your murderous, genocidal "adventures", or the curses of your many, many victims.  <br/><br/>My first thought was that this could be its own thing, but it seems to fit so well with D&amp;D ... but I'm not a D&amp;D expert; disabuse me of that notion if I'm way off base.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85730/#Comment_85730" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-06T07:16:55+00:00" title="August  6, 2007  7:16AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bizzaro.

In my game, "Mazes of Madness", you and your party (save one) all degenerate and die over the course of single hellish dungeon crawl.

The idea was that the PCs are generated at "10th level" and begin the campaign at their highest power level and then play through the decline towards their inexorable demise.  <br/><br/>Our Feedback group continued collaborating for a few weeks after Game Chef and I toyed with the idea of reworking <i>Decommissioned </i>to something involving deities in decline, but didn't get far.<br/><br/>I really like this idea.  It makes the idea of a Story Game with an Endgame scenario make sense in my head.  Plus, since it is the premise of the game, the players come into it on board with the story and don't feel like the GM is targeting them unjustly.

The more they do, the more they forget.  And not just in terms of abilities, but in their social connections as well.  The more time spent with friends and family, the fewer memories of them they have.  In order to stop the curse, they have to go adventuring, but the more they adventure, the quicker they unspool.  It becomes a race: can they discover the source while they still have power to stop it?  It could be a purely personal attack, or it could be part of a larger plot.  Maybe the adventurers are the powers that be in an area, and were cursed so that another power group could move in to replace them, or to leave a community vulnerable to an invasion.<br/><br/>And, of course, as they unspool, enemies completely unrelated to the curse are going to take advantage.  And the relationships with junior associates will change.  High priests find themselves slipping below their acolytes' power, commanders become weaker fighters than their lieutenants.  Characters with animal companions that are level-dictated have to deal with losing them.<br/><br/>Perhaps they're getting younger, too, which could cause some awkwardness, especially in romantic relationships.

The hook was going to be that at some point (level 10/name level), one of the PCs sacrifices themselves to save the others in some sort of time vortex.

Run a critical event and then work backwards to the start of the chain.

Is this based on the rule for earlier editions where you gained XP for acquiring gold?<br/><br/>The acquisition of wealth would throw a bit of a monkeywrench in the plan: a first level character with 10th level gear is way more powerful than your typical first level character.  You'd need to be taking away their magic items along with their XP and abilities.  Perhaps you have a "Magic Goes Away" global plot going on, where the XP loss and related effects are universal.  As the PCs go on, their magic items degrade from +3 to +2, then +1 then just a sword, as do all other magic items they find.  Eventually, they live in a world without magic, monsters or heroes.<br/><br/><br/>Magic item creation runs off of spending XPs in the current D&amp;D edition, so would be another sticking point, if any PCs were interested in that.  Would you gain XP from crafting things?  Or still lose, and accelrate your progress back to nothing even more?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_85815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85815/#Comment_85815" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-06T11:21:26+00:00" title="August  6, 2007 11:21AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mr. Teapot</cite>As the PCs go on, their magic items degrade from +3 to +2, then +1 then just a sword, as do all other magic items they find.

(mind is blown). these characters, so accustomed to a life of valor and combat- would they accept aging and retireing, or would they set themselves on some suicide mission so they wouldn't have to sit by the fire, thinking of better days? and the whole "is this worth fighting? can i avoid doing anything to help these people?" thing... messed up. so good.<br/><br/>jason (and all the folks who've had this idea over the years), hats off.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86227/#Comment_86227" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-07T13:45:26+00:00" title="August  7, 2007  1:45PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh. I'm glad people are enjoying this idea. Personally, I fail to see the point.<br/><br/>D&amp;D is a game <i>specifically designed</i> to be about tactical combat, rewards, and increasing personal power / personal challenges. As such a game, it actually works surprisingly well. It just so happens it's not exactly my cup of tea - if I wanted to do that, I'd play World of Warcraft instead, since it also caters to the exact same needs and is much more approachable and convenient.<br/><br/>To take such a ruleset and reverse it seems to be the worst possible thing you can do. You'd be dealing with all the challenges, rules crunch, and minmaxing in addition to the constant spectre of failure. The better you do, the worse off your character is in the end. Not only does it rub the Simulationist in me the wrong way - aside from the Curse idea, I can't see any reason why this would make any sort of sense - but the idea of all that work for a negative payoff is just painful.<br/><br/>There is a certain aesthetic and irony inherent in the idea that makes it interesting, but as a game I can't imagine it'd be anything but torture. For being a group of people near universally united behind "system matters", I don't get the enthusiasm behind taking a Gamist ruleset and thinking it'll turn Narrative just by turning it on its head, as some posts above imply.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86258/#Comment_86258" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-07T14:21:06+00:00" title="August  7, 2007  2:21PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>To take such a ruleset and reverse it seems to be the worst possible thing you can do.

I like to fail, what can I say?  I'm not convinced that reversing the experience progression is giving a big fuck you to the carefully-tuned system, though.  I honestly don't have enough experience to pontificate about it.  Maybe the smaller games built around this conceit mentioned up-thread would lead to more nuanced and graceful play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86376/#Comment_86376" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-07T21:27:11+00:00" title="August  7, 2007  9:27PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2007 5:34AM by lachek.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I like to fail, what can I say?</blockquote>\nOh, I like to fail too. My best games have come out of failing. I just don't like the idea of having to do mathematical jumping jacks to try to gain an advantage in the system just to get a guaranteed fail in the end. I'd rather play a story of ultimate failure and sacrifice using a system designed with that story in mind, rather than a system designed for a story where a young farmboy is gradually elevated through a series of adventures to ultimately pilot magical Ether ships between planes while fighting Eye Tyrant hive planets.<br/><br/>Consider the game of Twilight 2000 you discussed on Durham 3 a while ago. The system didn't lend itself to the type of story you were inspired to by the source material. T2K is about gun porn and extreme lethality in a warn-torn near-postapoc world. It is intended to be highly simulationist and tactical. That's not the story you were telling, so the system got  in your way. Right?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I'm not convinced that reversing the experience progression is giving a big fuck you to the carefully-tuned system, though.</blockquote>Oh no, the system would technically work just fine. I just can't imagine having fun playing it, is all. Interesting idea though, but for me, on a purely theoretical level.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86416/#Comment_86416" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T04:44:23+00:00" title="August  8, 2007  4:44AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for your thoughts, Mikael.
