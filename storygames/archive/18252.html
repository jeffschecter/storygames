There is an element of choice, but there is still the facet of "letting go" of control to the other players.<br/><br/>I really love that!<br/><br/>The scenario I am aiming for is a group of people who find themselves together at the scene of an accident (train/plane crash, exploded building etc) and don't know who they are or what has happened. As they work together they should be able to remember snippets of how their character's had previously interacted - gaining skills/assets, but at the same time building up a shared history.<br/><br/>An example of the top of my head:<br/>Two characters wake up and are looking around the debris. They hear the howling of wolves in the background, player A wants to have a gun to shoot at the wolves - so he describes spotting a gun lying in the snow and he picks it up - but player B gets to somehow state how player A knew that there was a gun/is able to use a gun - Player B describes a flashback where player A drew the gun on player B and flashed a badge - moments before the crash...<br/><br/>So now player A has a gun and skill to use it, but the history is now that it was being pointed at player B for some reason...<br/><br/>Future flashbacks could build on that scene, or build up another one...<br/><br/>What I loved in "penny" was the choice between two different possible memories - with the instigating player making a choice and handing over a token to help the next player remember more...<br/><br/>Dont know if I'm getting the feel for this idea across - Build character history and interaction through play, but making that "build up" part of the play experience rather than just "picking dots on a sheet"...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411642/#Comment_411642" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-09T06:23:33+00:00" title="April  9, 2013  6:23AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Dont know if I'm getting the feel for this idea across - Build character history and interaction through play, but making that "build up" part of the play experience rather than just "picking dots on a sheet"...</blockquote>\nYes you totally are, and I totally dig it.

Presumably once they have the final version, then you can throw them some money.  Backers have gotten a rough draft of the rules document (which look pretty good), but not the final version or the scenarios and stuff promised.<br/><br/>Alas Vegas is pretty close to what you're looking for: as the PCs go through the game, their player or other players can describe flashbacks of their past to gain them new skills.  <br/><br/>Actually, it would be pretty cool to mash the two together: each time you want to learn a skill, you request what knowledge you want and ask two players for a flashback that would explain how you know that (then pick the true one).  Or you narrate a flashback, and ask two players what skill you learned from it.  Or something.

The PCs started with one personality trait and one distinguishing feature each; no names. They woke up in the deepest room in a catacomb dungeon, and they fought their way out, forging some basic relationships and such. I had a couple NPCs prepped for the nearby town. Roughly the same rules. Distinguishing feature, personality trait, and location where they woke. I also had a list of features and traits for any NPC they wanted there to be that I hadn't prepped. By about three sessions in they'd set themselves up as de facto rulers of the town and had helped actively developed a town of something like 40 people, and set up relations with two other communities. <br/><br/>I wrote an introductory module for Mystic Empyrean that starts right after the world ends, everyone's memory wiped, with fragments of it coming back through play bestowing the Persona Traits through cards. It's proved well in playtest.

When these are chosen for resolution, the player rolls on the appropriate table to see what memories they recover. ("I remember... a wedding ring being important to us both for some reason.")  Different groups can choose varying numbers of amnesia dice, leaving some number of relationships, needs, objects and locations undefined.  (This would require a playset carefully crafted to prevent relationships conflicting with each other.)<br/><br/>Possibility B:<br/>Mash amnesia into the Melancholy Finnish Tag Team setup in the companion.  Throughout Act 1, you define each element as you go.  When you're the focus character, you choose a category for one relationship/need/etc that ties to your character.  Then the other character tied to that element picks the specific entry from the category.  Then play out the scene.  Then that player works with the next player to define the element that ties their PCs together and they have a scene about that.  By the end of Act 1, everyone should have all their stuff defined.  (This doesn't necessarily mean that the PC knows all that, though... it could be that someone else knows, or just that the players as audience/creators know.)  Possibly include a custom Tilt table with elements like "That thing you remembered was a false memory" and/or "you still can't recall your important relationship with another character" and "you discover the dark truth about why everyone lost their memories".

Everyone started with a blank character sheet, and wrote down stats and skills as they used them, until they'd assigned all their points. It was inspired by the realization that in movies where a group of people do a job, they always seem to have the skill they need - you don't break into the room with the safe but no one has safe-cracking/lockpicking.  You need design-in-play players; it would likely fail badly with design-at-start players. You could do something similar with Fate.<br/><br/>The first game started with the players describing their PCs' shoes as they entered the briefing room. There they got the briefing (some unsettling video from a failed expedition into the world's deepest cave, in Mexico), established that they were the best people in the world at dealing with situations where no-one knew what was going on, and we went from there. I still have fond memories of the phone conversation "Dustbin." "DUSTBIN?" "Uh, no! Ashtray. Ashtray!"<br/><br/>In the second game (some of the same players, different PCs) they were sent into Sing Sing prison to find why Death Row had gone silent and nobody who went to investigate returned.<br/><br/>When I run <em>Lacuna part 1: The Creation of the Mystery and the Girl from Blue City (second attempt)</em> for players who've never played before who choose "the Full Lacuna Experience" over "the training wheels version" (I always give them the choice), they choose their age, skills, and talent, but I explain nothing, and they have to figure it out as they proceed. That's worked really well.<br/><br/>But in general I'm not a fan of amnesia starts in convention one-shot games, because they can have serious traction issues, especially when you're also trying to teach the system. If players don't know the system, the setting, or even their characters, they don't have a lot to go on. Wheel-spinning can result. <em>Lacuna</em> has a bias towards action, because [REDACTED], so that turns out OK.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412046/#Comment_412046" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-15T06:45:47+00:00" title="April 15, 2013  6:45AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 15, 2013 6:46AM by CarpeGuitarrem.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Amnesia Fiasco...<br/><br/>Possibility A:<br/>You replace some regular black/white dice with stunt dice.  When these are chosen for resolution, the player rolls on the appropriate table to see what memories they recover. ("I remember... a wedding ring being important to us both for some reason.")  Different groups can choose varying numbers of amnesia dice, leaving some number of relationships, needs, objects and locations undefined.  (This would require a playset carefully crafted to prevent relationships conflicting with each other.)<br/><br/>Possibility B:<br/>Mash amnesia into the Melancholy Finnish Tag Team setup in the companion.  Throughout Act 1, you define each element as you go.  When you're the focus character, you choose a category for one relationship/need/etc that ties to your character.  Then the other character tied to that element picks the specific entry from the category.  Then play out the scene.  Then that player works with the next player to define the element that ties their PCs together and they have a scene about that.  By the end of Act 1, everyone should have all their stuff defined.  (This doesn't necessarily mean that the PC knows all that, though... it could be that someone else knows, or just that the players as audience/creators know.)  Possibly include a custom Tilt table with elements like "That thing you remembered was a false memory" and/or "you still can't recall your important relationship with another character" and "you discover the dark truth about why everyone lost their memories".  That sort of thing.</blockquote>\nOooh, good ideas. I particularly like the "Stunt Dice" one. Though, there'd probably have to be a mechanism to prevent one player from accumulating all the stunt dice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412061/#Comment_412061" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-15T12:49:44+00:00" title="April 15, 2013 12:49PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gah.
