The following is a beta idea for a method of creating Powers using Keywords as loose restrictions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere exists 40 Keywords. During Character Creation you either roll up two or choose two. I suppose you could even roll up one and then choose the other. This is likely based on an agreement between the players at the table.<br/>\n<br/>\nRolling for Keywords isn't as painfully random as it sounds. You roll two sets of 1D100, pick one result for the X-Axis and the other result is used for the Y-Axis. Then you do it once more. This gives you a small amount of control over what you receive.<br/>\n[align=center]<img alt="vr5v85.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://i34.tinypic.com/vr5v85.jpg"/>[/align]<br/>\nKeywords form the core of each character's Power. Once a player has his Keywords he expected to detail his Theme. Theme details what your Keywords mean for your specific Character.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you have your Theme, you create 3 Techniques. Techniques are representations of what your character knows how to do with his Powers. Think of Green Lantern and the way he learns to do different things with his power ring... Heroes begin with great power but they only unlock their true strength by using and understanding their power. As the game progresses... The players will get chances to acquire new Techniques at the behest of the GM.<br/>\n<br/>\nTechniques are encouraged to be narrowly defined but are only as mechanically detailed as the players at the table agree is necessary.<br/>\nThis means that if your group agrees on it, you may have to define how many feet you can teleport, whether or not you can teleport to places you've never seen before, if you can teleport others with you, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is... does there exist too much creative freedom here for this to be a viable option for creating powers?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions, observations, questions, comments, criticisms and such things are welcome. As long as they pertain to the topic, of course. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>\n<br/>\nSuggestions regarding more/different Keywords are both welcomed and appreciated. =D I do realize that some of the Keywords are insanely vague while others overlap... The overlapping part is fine, in my opinion, because the origin of the power may yet be very different.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod" title="MacLeod"><img alt="MacLeod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/734/nPH37A6Q7QKN7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod">MacLeod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233595/#Comment_233595" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-22T04:45:52+00:00" title="September 22, 2009  4:45AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 22, 2009 4:50AM by MacLeod.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Examples...<br/>\n<br/>\n[align=center]<b><u>Themes</u></b>[/align]<br/>\nDuke has the Teleport and Shadow Keywords.\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Duke has access to the Shadow Dimension.

In fact... I think the encouraged option should be, 'Select one Keyword and roll for the other.'<br/>\n<br/>\nI did mention in the first post that new/additional suggestions for Keywords would be helpful. For instance, Time is not really a favorite of mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think part of it is that you have to be self-motivated and really interested in the superhero genre. That said, I'm sure that applies to every RPG that revolves around a specific genre... its just that with anything that allows free form player creation (PDQ, Risus, Donjon, etc...) it is doubly true. In a way this lays more responsibilities onto the player... which can be perceived as good or bad. I only created the system this way because that's what I wanted out of a game. I wanted that free form style of player created abilities only made specifically for superheroes.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Apart from that, it's hard to know what to suggest. We could go in the usual direction, which means you answer the following three questions: what's your game about? What do the players do? What do the characters do?</div>\n</blockquote>\nThe game is about <i>a bit above street level</i> superheroes doing what superheroes do; being super heroic. The game is meant to be powered by a light set of rules that allow for free form creation and interpretation with advice designed to promote the previously mentioned ideas.<br/>\nPlayers are encouraged to invest as much creative thinking as possible in the designing and application of their heroes' powers. The mechanics are simple enough to where one isn't required to plan a lot as far as the dice and how they are thrown is concerned. Its more about coming up with great ways that the characters can impact the game fiction, especially as far as powers are concerned.<br/>\nI don't think I'm capable of writing a game (or, even the basics of a game) that isn't about what characters do. So my answer to the 3rd question is the same as my first response. The game is about characters and what they do, primarily what the PCs do.<br/>\nThe included (admittedly sparse) setting has the common people aware of super powered individuals. All the super powered folks are aware of what they can do off the bat. The event that causes the outbreak of strangely evolving humans is the same event that creates super zombies with powers similar to the living super folks plus the thirst for human flesh. Think zombie apocalypse crossed with Batman only Batman can teleport and drain electricity.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">I think I'd need to know about the central mechanic before knowing whether Action Words are a good idea.</div>\n</blockquote>\nYou can see <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=28740.0" rel="nofollow">here at the Forge</a> how the mechanics turned out. You'll see how badly my mechanics were bashed initially, as well. -_-<br/>\nWhat you need to know as related to Techniques is that mechanically they are free to interpretation for the most part based on how detailed the group wishes things to be. Originally I intended to include mechanical suggestions for the application of powers... but then I got to thinking about this 'Action Word' idea. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray" title="Tim_Gray"><img alt="Tim_Gray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray">Tim_Gray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234099/#Comment_234099" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-24T12:28:27+00:00" title="September 24, 2009 12:28PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mr Wesley!
