I've had a draft in my blog about this subject for a while, but I wasn't sure that my current playtests were successful enough to warrant basing any best practices on, yet. I've got three more sets I plan on cooking up, during which I'll make notes about why I make certain choices, and then see what the public thinks of all that. So, I have my opinion, but I'm not sure it's been proven enough to warrant best-practices type material.<br/><br/>Presumably we're looking for feedback from players as well as playset writers, yeah?<br/><br/>But I watch this thread with great interest!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300601/#Comment_300601" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-12T12:56:11+00:00" title="November 12, 2010 12:56PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Will Hindmarch</cite>So, I have my opinion, but I'm not sure it's been proven enough to warrant best-practices type material.</blockquote>\nA well-disclaimered opinion is welcome, as well.

In fact, everyone who's got a favorite playset can say why that playset is particularly good in play. <br/><br/>(Note: I'm interested in which ones have demonstrably worked best for you, not which ones you like best.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300618/#Comment_300618" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-12T13:40:30+00:00" title="November 12, 2010  1:40PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Make sure to include plenty of asymmetrical Relationships, especially ones that include a power differential.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor" title="Brennan_Taylor"><img alt="Brennan_Taylor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor">Brennan_Taylor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300667/#Comment_300667" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-13T04:36:35+00:00" title="November 13, 2010  4:36AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think as a beginning player, playsets that are heavy on crime and rely strongly on genre tropes from Coen Brothers or Elmore Leonard style stories hold up best for me. Some of the playsets have been a bit adventurous, which is probably fun for experienced players, but these have generally fallen a bit flat for me in play. By contrast, low-level crime sets work wonderfully in my groups.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300689/#Comment_300689" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-13T11:25:57+00:00" title="November 13, 2010 11:25AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An easy one: be sure to have Objects that will naturally make ideas spark in the player's minds. Either "how I'd use it for mischief" or "this will be so embarassing when it comes out" or "oooh, someone wil *really* want this thing", and so on.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Locations: pick places that underline the color of your playset, but that also suggest situation ideas. "A seedy, rundown bar" and "The cops pub" are both places to get a drink but hey, very different ideas of what can happen there!<br/><br/>And, last but not least, insert some recurring detail. Maybe a relationship or two have something to do with a location, or an object *clearly* belongs to some Location, and so on. If these "invisible threads" suggest "possible story ideas" to the players, well, all the better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300691/#Comment_300691" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-13T11:52:33+00:00" title="November 13, 2010 11:52AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing that makes the Boomtown playset work for me-- is that players attempting to portray Old West characters-- have used deadpan, deliberate, lack-of-affect speech.    Which helps keep the humor dry and creates a juxtaposition between atrocious behavior and calm, flat execution.<br/><br/>It's the opposite of broad, corny, 'funny voices'.   I have been guilty of Bad Acting in Fiasco and other games.<br/><br/>Overtly zany elements-- like making a character a Trekkie, or an over-the-top Redneck, or objects such as  a bag of jumping mice... are hard to maintain without lapsing into slap-happy silliness. <br/><br/>I'd say that emergent humor is preferable to pre-determined humor:<br/><br/>The odd dynamic between a step-father and stepson is going to produce both drama and humor, even tho there is nothing 'automatically' funny about the relationship.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300711/#Comment_300711" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-13T21:12:52+00:00" title="November 13, 2010  9:12PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Relationships and Needs seem to make or break play and sets.<br/><br/>the tightrope in Relationships is to be vague enough for the players to find something they identify and enjoy playing; but specific enough that it shapes interaction and calls out separate voices around the table.<br/><br/>Jason beat me up repeatedly about Needs for the "Transatlantic" play set.  The end result was much better than what i had originally stamped out.  I think it's the hardest part to write effectively and to try to create beats that frame the play set.  Needs are the carrot and the nail.<br/><br/>Locations and Objects can be generalized if need be, but there's very little reason to not have fun here and to use these fulcrums to point to Theme by providing specific color and detail.  I took the notes from my play tests and went back to these and fortified them to steer towards the general story threads that were hit on or hinted at through repeated play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300758/#Comment_300758" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-14T12:42:04+00:00" title="November 14, 2010 12:42PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm really interested in Rob's question about what your favorite playset is, and what sets it apart from the others for you and your friends.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
