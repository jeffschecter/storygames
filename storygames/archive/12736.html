(particularly in the non violent movies, like Kiki delivery service). <br/><br/>Last week we played a game session of Solipsist and I asked the GM if we could try to play in the Everyday magic genre.<br/>It was interesting, my kid nearly transformed the whole city into a magical forest and it was so tempting to solve many problems by simply changing peoples into animals. But near the end of the session, even with the heartwarming focus, it was apparent that my solipsist kid could be as scary as the psychic kid from the old Twilight Zone episode.  Well it was interesting, but regarding the everyday magic genre, the session was not entirely satisfying.<br/><br/>But I want to try again (maybe this time with a game tooled with conflict resolution mechanic). <br/><br/>From what I understand from the genre, some elements that interest me:<br/>- Resolving problems related to the everyday life.<br/>- Adding some magic issues or twists to problems of the everyday life.<br/>- Importance of relationships. <br/>- Showcasing cool details of the everyday life &amp; having slice of life scenes.<br/>- Wonderment &amp; heartwarming focus. With the possibility of having some poignant sad moments. <br/>- Not needing violence to resolve problems &amp; conflicts.<br/>- The presence of magic. And magic as a source of wonder.<br/><br/>Beside Witch Quest &amp; Yuuyake Koyake what other storygames could be interesting or tooled to explore Everyday magic genre?<br/><br/>Game experience related to the genre are also welcome. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286357/#Comment_286357" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-14T20:12:56+00:00" title="August 14, 2010  8:12PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Mortal Coil </i>would be a potentially good fit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286360/#Comment_286360" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-14T20:49:21+00:00" title="August 14, 2010  8:49PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I saw the title of this thread and thought "I hope someone has mentioned Mortal Coil." <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I think it would be a great fit, but I've only played it twice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83" title="Jumanji83"><img alt="Jumanji83" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83">Jumanji83</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286401/#Comment_286401" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-15T06:57:30+00:00" title="August 15, 2010  6:57AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder, why Mortal Coil?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy this game, and not another?

Most of the sample adventures get the characters to meddle in a known fairy tale, and help it reach a happy ending. Though the source material feels very Everyday Magic to me, the rules still include Duel mechanics for combat (with a sidebox saying we could ignore them for kids or inexperienced players 'cause they're more complex), and Sprites are actually described as pretty good warrior (+2 to her Body score when resolving a story challenge involving fighting) and they can spend essence for  incredible feats in combat. Fairies never die, they just fall asleep for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe system also uses task resolution, not conflict resolution. Though that shouldn't be too hard to modify. It's a very simple system. You have three stats (Body, Mind, Spirit) and no skills. You can pick a few gifts at character creation that give you bonuses for certain actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt should be possible, I think, to have these fairies help regular human friends reach a happy ending, using mostly magic and cleverness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286703/#Comment_286703" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T09:39:20+00:00" title="August 16, 2010  9:39AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A friend of mine ran a game of "Don't lose your Innocence"  which was based off the rules for "Don't rest your Head."  It sounded like a really easy conversion to me.<br><br>Also, Deliria has a ton of imagery and setting and tone to it, and if you peel it back to the three stat system, it goes pretty fast and loose.  Adding in all the other traits and non-sense makes it feel too.. crunchy to take in the magic.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
