It plays around with a lot of the same ideas as Gaiman's <i>Sandman</i> comics, but also rewards players for clever thinking and wordplay.   It's hard to compare the setting or premise of the game to anything, though it shares some conceptual space with Kult, Unknown Armies, and maybe Mage: The Ascension.  You play lesser gods in the contemporary world, with a fair bit of White Wolf-y social angst and emo descriptions. It's beautifully written and mechanically progressive but -- at least in my opinion -- unclear about larger structures of play, especially on the GM side of things, in the same manner that a lot of White Wolf games are. My biggest issue with Nobilis is figuring out how to structure a session of play.  I want Fronts or a GM Turn/Player Turn split or some other structural guidelines.  But the mechanics themselves are pretty awesome.  It's not a total success, through and through, but it's a solid and inspiration game that made a number of important mechanical and thematic developments.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279956/#Comment_279956" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-10T04:09:51+00:00" title="July 10, 2010  4:09AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 10, 2010 6:54AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks guys.

I've run three long running games, and a pick-up one shot game of Nobilis (while taking a 2 hour walk with some friends from out of town, where the Nobles where Bush cabinet members fighting a Nettle rite on behalf of the Founding Fathers). <br/><br/>In many ways Nobilis, at least how I run and experience Nobilis, is a game based around Never Saying No (the Monarda Law, which is indeed a critical part of the game). But as the Hollyhock God you need to be as clear and direct about the consequences of the yes as you can. The rest of the rules of the game, the setting, and the myriad creations of play (whether establishing what falls under your domain of boundaries or what the Ayn Rand Excrucian Clone might be willing to do to you) help to shape and guide those consequences. The question the game asks is never can I do this, but rather <i>should</i> I do this, or perhaps <i>should</i> I do this in this way.<br/><br/>As for GM tools, personally, opposition structure wasn't the bar that was hard to reach. It was never hard to stat out opposing Imperators, Nobles, and Excrucian shards. <br/><br/>Lastly, I also never found recruiting for Nobilis difficult, perhaps it was the concept of a Sandman RPG or what not, but as a concept I found it captured player's attention, and I rarely found the process of creating Nobles to undermine their interest. (I admit the So You've Become Enobled Pamphlet was a huge help in one of my later games.)<br/><br/>   - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279966/#Comment_279966" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-10T06:30:16+00:00" title="July 10, 2010  6:30AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nobilis is, at least in my experience, no harder to run than pretty much any other game out there, especially if you actually read the book's ton of advice on how to run it, and the example of play, and so forth. I've certainly run and played the GWB version successfully many times, ranging from epic year-long campaigns with a rotating base that capped at about a dozen players to one-shots with two PCS.

I'm enjoying it greatly, though I feel like I still have no idea how to run it.  The core of Nobilis is presenting the characters with mysterious circumstances and insoluble problems which they then proceed to tackle using their extremely-powerful-yet-bizarre-and-specific tools.  This typically creates social fallout for the characters, either within the party (due to differing creeds), or in larger Noble society.  Plots operate at three levels: personal, ontological (affecting the noble's estate), and official (the noble's role as soldiers in the war against the excrucians), and these things play off against each other.  The mechanics are shockingly effective at adjudication for a system where you can do virtually anything.<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I have not actually read the text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon" title="JBMannon"><img alt="JBMannon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon">JBMannon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279996/#Comment_279996" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-10T15:48:38+00:00" title="July 10, 2010  3:48PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I spent several years trying to peice together how to play this game.

I had a bow that would destroy the relationships of whatever you shot with it (like, I freed a prisoner by shooting the chain he was shackled with, thereby breaking its relationship with the wall).  It was actually pretty sweet.  I have no idea how by-the-book it was, but I think it was close because my buddy is usually big on RAW.

You have such good taste in games that are coming out soon.<br/><br/>I've played Nobilis (at Origins in years past!) and it was so wonderful. The concepts that come out of the game are so fun. The group we played with stuck true to the Gaiman mythos a bit, and made Big Archetypal Ideas that people could play as PC's. I played Justice, a representative of the Dark. She was blind, of course. My husband played Hope, a representative of Hell. He's a conniving bastard, so it was a perfect roll for him. Some other great Powers I remember that were in play were Guns (Kalishnakov), Greed (a golden dragon), the IRS, Poison, Riddles (a sphinx) and Emily Bronte.<br/><br/>I've since waited for the opportunity to play Nobilis again.

Nobilis is about kicking ass in a superhero kind of way?<br/><br/>I thought the rules-as-written (and certainly the way we played it) made it clear that once you're involved in physical combat, you've kind of already lost. Violence being the last refuge of the incompetent, etc, etc.<br/><br/>In the Nobilis campaign I played in, all conflict was fundamentally social conflict. It kind of has to be. EVERYTHING has some sort of person/personality behind it. Whether its the spirits of clouds and trees and cellphones or the higher elements of Nobilis and their Imperators. Any theme or idea that comes out in the story will probably have a person/personality behind it. Sure those spirits/Nobilis/Excrucians/whatever might have contrary views and sure there are attacks against Creation via such things as flower rites, but it seems to me the solution never involves dropping a building on someone. In my opinion, that's what made flower rites so cool -- they were these small stories about specific people and events whose results could echo across the world tree.<br/><br/>Our games wandered all over the place with regards to how deep the dreamlike/metaphorical space got -- we had very personal scenes where the Power of Revenge had to deal with the fall out of his old mortal life (and he didn't make things easier by making the man he hated and loved most in the world his first Anchor) all the way up to the campaign's climax which involved weaving an Excrucian INTO reality to become The Apple that Eve Ate via the Power of Seeds. And in my experience was never, ever about kicking ass as some sort of superhero.<br/><br/>-d-                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280314/#Comment_280314" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-13T08:26:58+00:00" title="July 13, 2010  8:26AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah the thing I found pretty consistently in the Nobilis games I ran was that direct, physical confrontations led to stalemates.

Just comparing Aspect miracles could get pretty boring, too. The Auctoritus (I think that's what it's called) could make things more interesting if I remember the rules correctly, because any miracle (including physical, Aspect based ones) could be messed up by the target's Spirit, so you could have seemingly weak-looking Nobles (low Aspect) shaking off your punch-the-moon impressive kung-fu.<br/><br/>If I remember correctly, there was even a Rite that upped the protection on a noble the bigger and more ridiculous the "insult" to his/her person became.

You have to bring it.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you just want "She's the wolf queen, alpha of alphas! He's the power of Love, the swain that must be wooed, not captured! They fight crimes against reality!" Well, that's a hell of a lot easier, and in at least several people's opinions, just as fun. The beauty of the game is that, even played very straightforwardly, it still produces some fantastic scenes. "Hmm, some excrucians are trying to undo the estate of Stone, but I'm sitting here as the Power of Dream, myself. Might as well put it to use. So what are the local stones dreaming of?" And before you know it you're inside the dreams of a ring of monoliths battling an Excrucian Warmain and his corrupted Mystery Cult minions, while in the background empires of man rise and fall in the blink of an eye (because how else would stones dream of the world?), and a little sign drops from the ceiling over your gaming table saying "awesomeness achieved".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280365/#Comment_280365" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-13T11:03:03+00:00" title="July 13, 2010 11:03AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Benhimself</cite>...a little sign drops from the ceiling over your gaming table saying "awesomeness achieved".</blockquote> This is my experience, but it took us hours to figure out where the switch was that opened the little door in the ceiling.

Like in Dogs, the insoluble problem forces the players and characters to make difficult moral choices.  Half the time, the PCs solve the insoluble problem through creativity, and do their best to solve the problem while making it worse.  After the PCs deal with the situation, it produces a variety of consequences and has established a moral standing for your character.  So then the GM pushes the morality a little further and/or brings in the consequences of your last action in the next Bang that they introduce.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280384/#Comment_280384" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-13T11:36:20+00:00" title="July 13, 2010 11:36AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What he said.

Or it seems to me that you can play them with a lot of conflicting forces and divided loyalties, where the characters have to make tough choices and often wrestle with conflicts with themselves and with each other.  The mechanics in Nobilis seem to me to support either play style solidly, depending on what you choose to emphasize; the examples of play seem to suggest gnostic superheroes, while the game fiction seems to support a more complex game. <br/><br/>The way I managed that level of complexity in Vampire was by thinking not of the PCs versus everyone else, but by having something like a dozen different important NPCs and factions at a time, each with its own goals.  The PCs were known to be friends, but several of the important NPCs were not above trying to drive wedges in between them, and each of the PCs had goals as well.  The end result was a complicated matrix of relationships and loyalties: the situation in the city was a tangled mess of allegiances, rivalries, and favors, and anything the characters did to resolve their problems was often the least bad option in a set of unattractive options, and often had unintended consequences.

I think its nicely somewhere between her mini-fictions that run along the margins of the book, the beautifully inspiring artwork inside, and these kickass gnostic superheros you're bandying about. I mean, I think Sandman is a better analogy, if you're talking about gnostic superheroes, right? The endless are comic book heroes, but they don't kick ass like batman. They kick ass like gods. Through trickery, deciet, slight of hand, love, history, time, illusion and belief. I think Nobilis is to White Wolf as Sandman is to DC Comics.<br/><br/>But all that said in defense of the White Book, I still agree with you. Design Matters and all that.

That's almost sublime in it's brilliance, kinda like playing "My Life With Imperator" on the side, without telling the players.<br/><br/>Kira, I'm definitely willing to believe that stuff is there. After playing Apocalypse World and seeing how approaches to GMing can be made explicit, into core principles and techniques rather than paragraph-upon-paragraph of "how to be a good GM," I kinda want to go back to the Great White Book and pull out the core principles and "moves" for the Hollyhock God.  The Monarda Law is great, don't get me wrong, and was kinda "Roll the dice or say yes" before Dogs explicitly went there, but I feel like I want more explicit principles to help me avoid just falling back on Excrucian-of-the-week or problem-in-the-Chancel or wander-around-the-World-Tree.  Something that would help keep the game grounded in characters with real emotions rather than all the craziness that can go down around godlike beings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280419/#Comment_280419" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-13T13:59:53+00:00" title="July 13, 2010  1:59PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mr. Teapot</cite>The successful games of Nobilis that I've seen worked much more like Dogs in the Vineyard: the GM sets up some tangled mess of an insoluble problem that pulls the PCs in multiple different directions at the same time.  Like in Dogs, the insoluble problem forces the players and characters to make difficult moral choices.  Half the time, the PCs solve the insoluble problem through creativity, and do their best to solve the problem while making it worse.  After the PCs deal with the situation, it produces a variety of consequences and has established a moral standing for your character.  So then the GM pushes the morality a little further and/or brings in the consequences of your last action in the next Bang that they introduce.</blockquote>\nThat's not to say, Mr. Teapot, that my game didn't contain these things. It had complex relationships, philosophy (the Locus was Plato's Cave, trying into a general theme of illusion and perception - helped greatly by the Power of Mirrors) and consequence. It's just that, after a long evening's gadabout, the players want to throw down and let their creative juices fly in adrenaline-pumping battle. I don't think the label of 'gnostic superheroes' is pejorative, nor should it be avoided in play; it's one of the better halves of the game. It is testament to the quality of <i>Nobilis</i> that it's combat requires players to be <i>twice</i> as creative in half the time - in terms of the imagination, men are forged from boys in the heat of a full-scale Excrucian incursion. Kicking ass lets players be just has inventive as dealing with complex r-maps or moral labyrinths, perhaps even moreso.<br/><br/>Besides, all this talk of 'morals' is making me uneasy. Especially when you consider how <i>Nobilis</i> presents Heaven and Hell.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284818/#Comment_284818" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-08T07:25:38+00:00" title="August  8, 2010  7:25AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://imago.hitherby.com/?p=3587" rel="nofollow">There's this now.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284926/#Comment_284926" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-09T09:29:47+00:00" title="August  9, 2010  9:29AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jessecoombs</cite><a href="http://imago.hitherby.com/?p=3587" rel="nofollow">There's this now.</a></blockquote>\nThat's a little strange.
