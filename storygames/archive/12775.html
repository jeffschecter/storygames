I am trapped within a really terrible Dungeons and Dragons campaign and I can't find my way out. My player is a horny 14 year old loser who won't stop forcing me to have sex with slutty elf chicks instead of going on quests. The dungeon master has severe attention deficit disorder and skips large sections of description when it comes to the world I live within. Please find my character sheet and bring it to a better dungeon master, preferably a benevolent one with a vivid imagination who actually knows what he's doing. Please, I beg of you to deliver me from this nightmare, before all of my hit points run out . . . </blockquote>\nPretty funny. I've been developing a pet peeve about rpg comedy through the last couple of years, though; seems like we only ever get rpg stories about dysfunctional play, narrated by people embarrassed by their hobby. Might be because functional games are indistinguishable from conventional fiction or something.<br/><br/>Anyway, not your topic - speaking of the book, do you know anything more about the author? Seems like he has several titles under his belt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/netwomble" title="netwomble"><img alt="netwomble" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh6.google.com/netwomble/R5fup6Cz6tI/AAAAAAAABIQ/mSl7x0gzHo0/s144/Womble_logo_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/netwomble">netwomble</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287273/#Comment_287273" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T12:53:15+00:00" title="August 18, 2010 12:53PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Um, I'm kind of ashamed to admit that I find <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=524538" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> pretty funny so far.

Halfway in.<br/><br/>What I like about it is, well, that it's about me and my friends and the worst players I've ever met, when I was... probably fourteen. I still remember my female half-elf Leetah Malnuthion, with giant boobs, having sex with my best friend's character Akira Bandylegs, a dwarf. And I remember people having their characters attacking everything in sight, including furniture (this happens in the book). And the DM letting the fighty character survive through all odds, just to keep the player in the game. And playing with the weirdest people just because they were gamers, because that was the only way to play. (I'm sure other people felt the same way about me, though). Etc.<br/><br/>The book has been criticized for portraying gamers as dysfunctional and socially inept. Well, when I was in my teens, <i>that was my world</i>. And probably a lot of other kids' world, too; I don't know many people who remember their early teens as a smooth ride of social mastery and joy. The things we do... man.<br/><br/>Of course, in this book, everything is condensed and pushed to the limit. Still, most of the (real-world) characters are believable... except maybe the DM with his cardboard-dragon wheelchair.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
