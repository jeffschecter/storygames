His body crawled with perspiration and he was muddy from dragging himself into position on his belly.  The rifle extended ahead of him like another limb.<br/><br/>The air was dead-still and laden heavily with moisture.  At a range of three hundred yards there was bullet drop to consider, but at least there was no crosswind.  The compound squatted in the deep V of a narrow valley, watchtowers at three stations, but the men inside wouldn't see Cutter where he lay in wait.<br/><br/>He glassed the inside of the compound with his scope, tracking silently with the rifle.  Fat droplets of warm water fell from the tree limbs above and soaked into the jungle camo Cutter wore.  Somewhere down there was Trang.  When he saw Trang, he would put a bullet in the man's head.  The crosshairs.  One touch of the trigger.  Done.<br/><br/>All he had to do was wait.</i><br/><br/>So last week <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11068" rel="nofollow">I posted a discussion about simulating the complexity of bullfighting</a>.  At issue was how to replicate the subtleties of the form (or of something like that) without resorting to total abstraction or its opposite, the flurry of dice rolls.  I think the subject may have been too esoteric.<br/><br/>Thinking about this topic further, and because <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/account.php?u=2157" rel="nofollow">FigureFour</a>'s working on a ninja game, I realized there's another situation where this kind of thing comes up: assassination.<br/><br/>In this case, the actual act <i>is</i> a matter of a single die roll.  In the example above, it's a sniper firing a single shot that will either eliminate the target or not.  When a ninja strikes from the shadows she's either going to administer a killing blow or not.  What matters here isn't the intricacy of the <i>act</i>, but in everything <i>leading up to</i> the act.<br/><br/>The sniper has to find a perfect place from which to take his shot.  It can take minutes or hours and then there's the long, agonized waiting.  A ninja creeps through a moonlit compound at night evading guards and climbing through unguarded windows to be in the exact right moment at the precise time to make her kill.<br/><br/>Sure, these things could be simulated by a series of dice rolls.  The sniper checks Perception, or whatever, to find a suitable spot, then the applicable skill to assemble a nest and then when the time comes he pulls the trigger and rolls to it.  Likewise with the series of stealth rolls the ninja makes to accomplish her task.  These things don't seem to invest much in the process and what ought to be the climax \u2014 the killing itself \u2014 is just another roll at the tail end of some other rolls.<br/><br/>There has to be a way to dramatize the steps leading up to the assassination, but I don't know what it might be.  Hence my submission to you, hive mind.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247341/#Comment_247341" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-17T11:36:17+00:00" title="December 17, 2009 11:36AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm, here's something completely off of my head.  it assumes a skill system of some sort . Let's call these complex things we want to simulate extended tasks.  There is a number of steps to the task, of which the player knows at least some of, and may know all of.<br/><br/>For your sniper/assassination case, they might be: find spot, (avoid patrol), wait, take shot, escape.  The step in parentheses is unknown to the player until the step before.<br/><br/>Each step consists of two or three options (one is possible, but less interesting, four or more may be excessive).  Each option is consists of a two-sided card (actually, cards don't have to be physically present, but they are a convenient way to talk about it).<br/><br/>Each topside of the card has a solution or approach to the step (the bushes near the road, the top of a nearby hill, etc.), a skill or a set of skills, an <i>approximate</i> difficultly, a possible benefits (phrased in terms of bonuses to later steps).  <br/><br/>Each face down side of a card has the actual difficulty and the actual benefits, and maybe some additional narrative color.<br/><br/>The player makes their choice, (which could include retreating to an earlier stage, or aborting the whole procedure (although some steps, such as those involving enemies) may not allow this), flips over the card and either makes a skill check or automatically succeeds (if it's easy enough or they have enough time -- take 10 and those sorts of rules).<br/><br/>If they succeed, they get the benefits on the card (a good location will give bonuses to the assassination shot), if they fail, they either go back and try again, or there will be consequences on the card (guards alerted!  You fall in hole!, etc.).<br/><br/>Repeat until task is done.  Don't forget to role-play each step (if you're not bothered by the"Dance, Monkey, Dance" problem", this is a good place to give bonuses for good description to avoid this process from degenerating into a purely mechanical step).<br/><br/>....<br/><br/>And by now, my debugger should have found the memory overwrite I'm looking for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247352/#Comment_247352" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-17T12:06:20+00:00" title="December 17, 2009 12:06PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could hack Mist-Robed Gate kinda.<br/><br/>1) Do a series of checks for various aspects of the preparation.

The PCs are randomly generated so it's hardly a matter of trained assassins or even trained fighters in most cases but so far it's been fun. Just as with real assassinations they also fail frequently due to bad luck and stuff. What's more is it is really hard to get away with murder in a medieval world with low population and no sniper rifles. The most successful assassination was getting a guy drunk and pushing him off a bridge, despite being an easy die roll the players cared alot about it since they had invested so much time in stalking and preparing and interacting with the NPC.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog" title="Z-Dog"><img alt="Z-Dog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog">Z-Dog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247373/#Comment_247373" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-17T13:17:29+00:00" title="December 17, 2009  1:17PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stolen from Burning Wheel:<br/>\n<br/>\nAward extra dice to add to rolls when players make their character's lives complicated, hard, uncertain...when their working against their own interest.

That's one way of addressing this kind of issue.<br/><br/>The other big-picture problem I see is, how are the discrete tasks leading up to the crucial moment systematized?  I think this was part of why the bullfighting example fell flat--not a lot of people have familiarity with what goes into a matador performance.  If I'm roleplaying an assassin, then most of what I describe will be cribbed from action movies I've seen.  Who's judging whether or not the preparation is on-target?  It's not ridiculous to think of someone at the table having military experience and therefore incorporating things into his descriptions that would never occur to me, but are significant (at least to him) in pursuing success.  But this could just as easily come up in some kind of crafting challenge, or survival, or an athletic contest.  So how is this discrepancy handled, between character understanding and player understanding?<br/><br/>Feel free to ignore me if I\u2019m missing the trees for the forest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog" title="Z-Dog"><img alt="Z-Dog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog">Z-Dog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247465/#Comment_247465" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-18T07:31:38+00:00" title="December 18, 2009  7:31AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To go along with what Daniel and I say above:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe process you outline above (a series of rolls with the final big roll just another roll) is, as you mention, boring, with no big pay-off. If you miss one roll in the series you just keep rolling until you succeed/utterly fail (death or give up). Same thing with the big roll.<br/>\n<br/>\nBW addresses this by giving choices to the player: exactly what do you want to accomplish with this roll? How much are you willing to risk? What failure consequences are you willing to accept? It also rewards you (ding!) for making the rolls tougher/taking additional risks/making your life complicated by giving you extra dice.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I love about those extra dice is you can chose to spend them where you wish. Want to save them up for the big shot? Fine...just means all those other rolls are going to be much harder. But maybe you don't give a crap about the big roll...maybe you've got a kick ass sniper skill...you want to spend it on convincing your father to loan you the gun you're going to use to kill the target. And there's no way in hell papa is going to lend you his gun, especially since he voted for the guy you're going to kill. So you chose to spend you dice there.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I like about this approach is it sets out a job for the player, and the player decides how to accomplish it, but he also gets to make statements about what's important to him by spending his dice on what concerns him the most.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247473/#Comment_247473" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-18T08:46:24+00:00" title="December 18, 2009  8:46AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 18, 2009 8:52AM by Bill_White.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The system that my brother Mel and I occasionally use for <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/ClassicTravellerOrigins" rel="nofollow">pick-up Traveller</a> actually does exactly this thing.

It's really rather exciting.\n<blockquote>You describe what you want to achieve, and you and the referee discuss the constituent tasks required to achieve it. The result is a task sequence of two to five tasks whose outcome determines the overall success or failure of the effort. <br/><br/>For each task, the referee sets the requisite difficulty (Routine 5+, Hard 8+, Very Hard 11+) as well as the general consequences of success or failure. One character leads the effort in every case; this is the \u201cactive character.\u201d That character\u2019s player describes how the character conducts the task, \u201cnarrating in\u201d up to one trait, one skill, and one item of technology in order to do so.  A trait gives a bonus or penalty according to its value (2, -3; 3 or 4, -2; 5 or 6,  -1; 7, +0; 8 or 9, +1; 10 or 11, +2; 12, +3). A skill provides its value as a bonus to the roll. <br/><br/>Other characters may be able to help, depending on the task. The player of a character who is helping another may narrate in one skill; the bonus is then applied to the roll.<br/><br/>The referee begins the task sequence with 1d6 points worth of complications. This number may increase or decrease during play. Note that a player can use up the referee\u2019s complications by introducing them himself or herself.\n<ul>\n<li>(1-3 pts) Personal Difficulty. Describe how the active character\u2019s personal limitations work against him or her in the current task and apply a DM to the roll based on the value of the trait thus invoked; e.g., if the character\u2019s . <br/></li><li>(2 pts) Mistaken Assumptions. Describe unforeseen obstacles emerging from misinformation or bad assumptions; make the player re-roll all dice and take the lower result.<br/></li><li>(2 pts) Technical Glitch. If the player uses a point of technology to roll additional dice, describe the equipment malfunctioning in some way and choose which two dice the player keeps.<br/></li><li>(3 pts) Catastrophic Error.

It's that thing about the system having teeth that people discuss sometimes, or the blog comment Vincent made about how Clinton gets him to give up his sandwich.  The means are as important as the ends or something like that; I\u2019m amalgamating from different sources so I hope someone might be able to put in a clearer way.

Then you can escalate for more dice ("stand off" escalate to "move into compound" escalate to "icepick to the ear") which would be bringing in complications as others have said, when you take fallout as necessary to keep the mission alive (you're IDed, you're being pursued, you suffer injury, you're killed by the guards who catch you).<br/><br/>It would be its own system--it's not a DitV hack with different terms for color--but the basic pattern of dice handling and fallout risking would work beautifully.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247568/#Comment_247568" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-18T19:21:52+00:00" title="December 18, 2009  7:21PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, basically what David said. While you'd have to gut Dogs of everything that made it about demons and cowboys, the "teeth" of it is what we're talking about here. <i>Dogs</i> is really the only game, that I can think of, that models the teeth-ness well. The teeth being the how is determines not only success in a win/fail way but also constrains and determines the costs and nature of the outcome. It does while being able to consistently represent thematic content based on narrative importance within the players' terms of permissiveness. That is do say, narrative actions by the players are valid so long as they conform to the groups consensus of what is possible within the game-world. However, it this doesn't result in 'freeform' because the actions have mechanical weight. <br/><br/>While for groups and players who don't need mechanical constraints to force them to role-play, this DitV's little dice game must seem tedious after one or two sessions. But I also suspect that those same people don't really want a game with as much teeth; this is why we have games from PTA to Archipelago. For the trad player whose not committed to or interested in tactical mini combat, DitV is ray of light. Simple, scalable and handles pretty much what ever you want to throw at it. FATE strikes me as similar in this regard, despite being radical different in implementation.<br/><br/>Anyways, that it for my rambling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247576/#Comment_247576" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-18T22:39:33+00:00" title="December 18, 2009 10:39PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I posted this in a couple of places some time ago.

The players get to make a plan and establish how cool and stylish their assassin is, but the mechanics would keep everything moving towards SOMETHING, so that you don't spend 4 hours arguing around a table about what the best way to assassinate the target is.<br><br>The details and the plan (which are cool) are still there, but the tedium and second guessing isn't.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249390/#Comment_249390" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-02T15:08:05+00:00" title="January  2, 2010  3:08PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm wondering how something like <i>Wilderness of Mirrors</i> works in practice, since it's supposed to indulge the players' love of planning with the draw of using all the dice the details of the plan provide.
