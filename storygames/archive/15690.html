Roleplaying is not the focus or even something many people understand as a category of game. RPGs have minimal floor space dedicated to them and tend to by hidden away. <br/><br/>But if your game falls into the Strategy, Card, Board, or Word game categories, it's much easier for a place like B&amp;N to sell them. Specifically Strategy games are their big sellers. They also break down Strategy games into \u201cadventure strategy\u201d and \u201cabstract strategy", with abstracts not selling well as adventures. <br/><br/>It seems like they care much more about the play value, clear rules, presentation, and price of the game rather than the quality of the physical components.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355899/#Comment_355899" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-25T09:41:58+00:00" title="January 25, 2012  9:41AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great interview.<br/><br/>I never would have thought a place like B&amp;N would, like, open and play the games they were selling to help them decide which games they were selling.

"<br/><br/>I think that it has more to do with "perceived value." Munchkin befuddles me as far as clear rules. You really need someone else who has played it to teach you.<br/><br/>Along the same lines, based on what Hasbro usually pushes out for the Christmas rush, you'd think that the people in charge at Hasbro really could care less about games,but the head guy at Hasbro who makes decisions on games, (Mike Hirtle, I think), is also a huge fan of intricate, well-produced games. Unfortunately, he also works for a company that looks hard at the performance of the bottom line, and what can be placed at places like Walmart and Target..and so his work really requires him to temper his opinions, and make sure that their products make money at $20 price points.<br/><br/>There was a point a few years ago that Hasbro did try to create a "hobby line" of games...but the margin just aren't there for a monolith like Hasbro to spend any effort on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
