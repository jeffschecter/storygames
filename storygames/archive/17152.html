So, maybe... I'll start with this thread. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>First things first, the book. You can find it on Lulu.<br/><a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/nathan-hook/hearts-blood/paperback/product-20062739.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.lulu.com/shop/nathan-hook/hearts-blood/paperback/product-20062739.html</a><br/><br/>The description from the author says:<br/><i>This book contains a role-play scenario inspired by Bram Stoker's classic novel Dracula. Players play out the main characters from the story, exploring the themes of lust &amp; temptation, immigration &amp; colonialism, sexuality and the role of women in Victorian culture, and in particular the theme of agency. The scenario explores agency - in the sense of free will - against a narrative that begins fixed and linear and becomes open and free as the characters struggle against the will of Dracula. The scenario uses a wide range of meta-techniques and approaches that are explained inside. The book is complete within itself. The scenario is for 2-8 players, ideally 4-6 players and 1 Organiser. Typical play time is 4 hours.<br/></i><br/>Our game had 4 female and 2 male players, plus me as the director-organizer. It lasted *exactly* four hours.<br/><br/>The game is a "jeepform", meaning that it is a sort of an impro story that all the participants play together, acting scene after scene.<br/>There are 8 main characters; playing in less than 8 players means that some of them has more than one character.<br/>The game is divided into 5 acts. Each act is made of different scenes. In the first act every scene is fixed. I say to the players: "this is our first scene; we'll have Dracula and Jonathan Harker. It's that famous scene where Harker arrives in Transilvania during a storm and Dracula welcomes him. It will end with an invitation to dinner". In act 2 the outcome of the scene will be chosen by the players during the scene itself: it's Lucy Westenra that will tell Mina which of her three suitors will be her husband. In act 3 and 4 there is a more open outcome. Act 5 is completely free: nothing is fixed (there are some suggestions) and the players decide together which scenes they want/need to set.<br/><br/>The game makes use of a wide array of "meta-techniques" to underline some themes: in the first act we have monologues, when a character can temporarily "step aside" from his public mask and offer to the "audience" a glimpse of his/her inner feelings. One of the most funny was the use of "black men" to represent the powers of Dracula (something that to all of us reminded of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ6wydS58pE" rel="nofollow">Matrix PingPong</a>).<br/>As the director, I frequently asked questions to the players, usually at the beginning or at the end of a scene. How are you dressed? What's the thing that creeps you most in Dracula?<br/><br/>The thing that I found most interesting was the way the author adapted a famous novel to a new format. The players were very excited and found it perfectly fit to start from pre-planned scenes, then gradually finding freedom to separate their story from the original novel and create new, unexpected events: in our installment, Lucy married dr. Seward and then he decided to stay with her in a vampiric afterlife, becoming the new heir of Castle Dracula, while Van Helsing was a much more uncertain fighter of the evil, and in a very moving scene he had to confront his dickensian ghosts of "past, present and future vampires".<br/><br/>All in all a very satisfying experience. After the game, we were all wondering what could it be another novel to adapt into a jeep format.<br/><br/>Has anyone else played (or read) this game? I'm curious. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Ciao<br/>Lorenzo                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matteo%20Turini" title="Matteo Turini"><img alt="Matteo Turini" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matteo%20Turini">Matteo Turini</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389209/#Comment_389209" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-04T14:01:08+00:00" title="September  4, 2012  2:01PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2012 2:01PM by Matteo Turini.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had not heard of it before, but your account made me extremely curious.
