It's that if you walk in late, you don't know what's already happened in the fiction. You don't know things the other players know, so it's harder for you to make something that fits whether you know it or not. You have a higher risk of creative veto because "oh, you didn't know about this other thing that already happened that makes your thing make no sense." In Microscope, a new player could walk up to the table on any turn, sit down and start playing. But I desperately recommend against it, because they would have no way to build something that worked with what had already been created.<br><br>To back up even farther: gaming is about creating this shared fictional space, where we all have basically the same idea of what is going on in our agreed upon make believe. So games often start slow and pick up speed as we all become more confident of what is true, what is important, etc. Coming in late is much like starting again from the beginning, but even worse because everyone else knows what you don't.<br><br>If you wanted to actively pursue this model, make something where the ignorance of late arrival is an advantage. Embrace that they are clueless, that everyone else at the table knows things they don't, don't try to gloss over it.<br><br>The downside is that you usually can't be sure you'll have walk-ins, so it might be tough to play a game where it was a central concept.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332392/#Comment_332392" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T23:21:31+00:00" title="June 29, 2011 11:21PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I did this the other night with On Mighty Thews.

In Fiasco, you can only ever be an NPC. (In Lacuna, InSpectres 3:16 and so forth, it's much easier to slot someone in.)<br><br>There's two things. Firstly, I think we've moved towards frontloading games with relationships and worldbuilding. There's something cool about that, but I don't want it to be the only way. You can come in late to a Diaspora game, but you'll never be involved to the same extent: none of the planets will be yours. Wouldn't it be more fun, in Diaspora, to point at a bystander and go "Hey, you, design a planet"? Or, in Fiasco, to say "Here's our playset. Take these dice. Work out some connections with other people. We could do with another Object."?<br><br>Secondly, I think many games demand an exact chunk of your time. Fiasco, say, plays through in about two hours. But what if I don't have two hours? What if I want a one hour game? Or what if someone wants to drop in for five minutes? Or someone's here for the next hour, but then they have to leave? I want games where you can slot people in and out, but still make their contribution meaningful. I want them to build the world too.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332421/#Comment_332421" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T04:38:06+00:00" title="June 30, 2011  4:38AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part of the problem with relationships is that you can, if you're not careful, get a combinatorial explosion of relationships.

It's hard to add someone into that. You might, say, give a new characters two relationships with the existing characters. But they'll always be slightly on the periphery. (You see a similar effect in LARPs, where there's a core of people who matter and a periphery of people who are merely connected to the core.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332424/#Comment_332424" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T04:58:48+00:00" title="June 30, 2011  4:58AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Archipelago, you can drop in for one turn (1-15 minutes, depending on yourself) or a whole campaign. <br/><br/>(In fact, it could be interesting to run a game where one new player joins in, and another one leaves, each round, just to see how information is retained/changed...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332426/#Comment_332426" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T05:01:46+00:00" title="June 30, 2011  5:01AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Given your point about LARPs, it's possible that the issue has also something to do with how many relationships a person can meaningfully form and sustain in the short period of time in which a game takes place.

Incorporating a new player needn't grind the game to a halt nor make it worse.<br/><br/>I think there's a false dichotomy, between <i>prolonged-invested-meaningful-fun-bondedtogether</i> and <i>quick-lackofinvestment-casual</i>. Games can be short, yet meaningful. Someone can be incorporated into a social group quickly. You can invest time in a game, but still enjoy inviting someone else to play. Your Halo example is an interesting one: a Halo session can be a quick, immersive, bonding experience. So can giving someone the controller while playing L A Noire. Why can't RPGs do that more?<br/><br/>For me, there's an interesting barrier between being a full and partial participant. If I come in late to Jason's Fiasco or JD's Prime Time Adventures, they'll find a role for me, as NPC or Nielsen audience. This is a good thing. Now, in Fiasco, I can't transition to being a full character (hey, here's a character sheet, join in). In Prime Time Adventures, I possibly can. So that's an interesting thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332632/#Comment_332632" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T05:03:53+00:00" title="July  1, 2011  5:03AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 1, 2011 6:42AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm pretty much playing devil's advocate at this point - I'd like to see what you are describing succeed.<br/><br/>Much of this has to be colored individually, but the best co-op video game experiences for me have always happened after hours and hours of team play.

I'd like playing games to be satisfying in the way that kicking a ball around is satisfying (even if just for a moment).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332637/#Comment_332637" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T05:42:03+00:00" title="July  1, 2011  5:42AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When introducing people to a long-running game with a distinctive setting and established relationships, one technique is to make their PC an outsider, that way they can learn about the setting details and relationships in character.

I know this guy in Fresno."</b></blockquote>This worked well for me in the game you've had going for 20+ years. All I knew was that they were a little trigger happy and that I'd have to keep my nose clean for the first year or so. It's pretty amazing to hear the warstories in character and the background is so rich now that without other players as guides it would be daunting to just jump in (I mean, has anyone actually played Sky Realms of Jorune? - rhetorical question). It's also interesting to see the group dynamic shift a bit as I become more integrated in the group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332799/#Comment_332799" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T14:07:02+00:00" title="July  1, 2011  2:07PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know this isn't what you're quite looking for, but I'm gonna say it anyway. <br/>There's a difference between observing a story for awhile, jumping in when you figure out what's lacking, then just jumping in blindly. <br/>I'm sure there'd be a mechanical way to speed that up.  Like assign all the archetypes that will appear in the very beginning of the game.  The GM would get the leftover archetypes that the players didn't choose; as NPCs. <br/>Whatever player shows up after that step; picks from the GM's archetypes..                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
