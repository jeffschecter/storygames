The idea of the game is that each player plays a character that is the survivor of a lost war or conflict. The theme is closer to Trojan Women then firefly however as it takes part directly after the winning military take over. The idea of the game is to tell stories of people who are fighting to hold on to what they had whilst surviving the changes put upon them and the inevitable loss caused by the conflict.<br/>The system is GM-less or rather everyone is a GM. The conflict itself gets set up prior to the games opening scene by the players and thus gets a character all of its own. <br/>The bit I'm currently wrestling with is whether or not to include dice. The dice in the system would be a measure of a characters traits. For example you might write the trait "I work well with my hands" and give it a d6. This was also going to be the system for assigning traits to the conflict, e.g "they used chemical weapons" d12.<br/>However I'm getting turned off on the idea because it seems to set a value on how bad a certain even in the conflict was. This is something i want to avoid doing because those values are up to the people who experience them (In this case the PC's) rather then an arbitrary system.<br/>Doing away with this i came up with a system of statistics for player characters based on point allocation and beads. <br/>The stat line reads as follows: HOPE<br/>                                             DIGNITY<br/>                                             LOVE<br/>                                             NUMB<br/>                                             FEAR<br/>                                             DESPAIR<br/>                                             INSANITY<br/>The idea being that in given situations characters would survive by shifting point from one statistic into another (hence the beads). An example of this would be the issue of not having enough money to pay the new taxes. A character might put one of her points of HOPE into NUMB to show she is hardening to the new taxes and is accepting her fate. Another character might might put a point of DIGNITY into FEAR as she attempts to sell her body for the money needed. However points can move across players if the groups can make it make sense. For example the mother of the group might put a point of her HOPE into the LOVE of her daughter.<br/>Its deciding a starting number of points to put into the stats that will come through once i can playtest the system.<br/><br/>The last thing about the game (sorry for rambling here) is the scene structure. I enjoyed another GMless game called road to lindisfarne which had a set number of scenes set up followed by an ending that must end one way or another. I think for this game a group must choose the amount of scenes leading to the end scene. The end scene i debated with the idea of it being fixed. The fixed point was going to be "The characters separate, how?" but i am starting to think that IF the characters separate is the more interesting question.<br/><br/><br/>Writing this has helped me settle some stuff in my head haha!<br/>What do you guys think? I want the game to make people think about the lives of the fallen in a serious way. About what people do to sacrifice and about what hold people together. I am putting a lot of research into the results of conflicts and wars. The game so far features three different time period options for conflicts and so example traits of things that may have occurred in that conflict.<br/>I need advice on how to make this reasonable but honest in terms of theme and engaging and emotional in terms of gameplay.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading and thanks for existing as a website!<br/><br/>.Dan.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415862/#Comment_415862" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-10T04:12:14+00:00" title="June 10, 2013  4:12AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds fun and interesting!

Maybe you want to actually group the traits that way and make it so that changes in one direction work differently than in the other direction. Maybe you can move a bead from positive to negative whenever you want, but moving from negative to positive requires group consensus or something. I like the idea that if you move all of your beads into the negative traits, then something bad happens - you look at the trait with the most beads and narrate a bad ending based on that.<br/><br/>I'd maybe take out Insanity. It seems like more of a conclusion than a gauge. It's the only thing I saw that raised a red flag in what you're saying so far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
