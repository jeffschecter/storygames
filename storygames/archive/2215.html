                    So. Fetishization.<br/><br/>I only see the word used as a pejoritive, but I think it's an interesting phenomenon and I'd talk to talk about it.<br/><br/>I'm having trouble formulating a more precise statement of intent than that, really. I just kinda want to talk about it. The only concrete thoughts I have are as follows:<br/><br/>*Harnessing gamer fetish is a powerful marketing/selling tool (yes? no? thoughts? data points?)<br/>*When the enjoyment garnered by a gaming fetish outweights the activity of gaming itself, thats problematic. But, is there any reason to care about this on more than a personal level? Is eliminating fetish objects going to get more actual play happening?<br/><br/>And, like, whatever you wanna talk about as well.                </div>

                            Well, let's back it up a step to see what the definition of Fetish is so as not to go all over the place:
<blockquote><br/><b>Fetish</b><br/>1.	an object regarded with awe as being the embodiment or habitation of a potent spirit or as having magical potency.<br/>2.	any object, idea, etc., eliciting unquestioning reverence, respect, or devotion: to make a fetish of high grades.<br/>3.	Psychology. any object or nongenital part of the body that causes a habitual erotic response or fixation.<br/></blockquote>
and 
<blockquote><br/><b>Fetishism</b><br/>1.	belief in or use of fetishes.<br/>2.	Psychiatry. the compulsive use of some object, or part of the body, as a stimulus in the course of attaining sexual gratification, as a shoe, a lock of hair, or underclothes.<br/>3.	blind devotion: a fetishism of sacrifice to one's children.<br/></blockquote>
Well, the obvious connotations after reading the actual definition lead me to think that, yeah, saying "fetish", "fetishism" and "fetishization" (which isn't really a word, but it's not hard to see it as 'the process of creating a fetish') <b>pretty much is pejorative</b>.<br/><br/>The only things I can think of that involve gaming and fetishism are the following:<br/><br/>1) That dice, or character sheets, or combat manuvers, etc <b>must</b> be used in a roleplaying experience, thought by some players and designers. (the definition of fetish as eliciting unquestioning devotion) And yeah, it happens sometimes. Other times, it's not really "fetish", it's just "strong preference".<br/><br/>2) The real fetish of believing that spirits or luck-gremlins or whatever inhabit dice. There's a lot of funny gaming stories out there about microwaving or drilling holes into "bad dice", leaving dice naturally set on the face you want them to come up the most to "train them", etc.<br/><br/>In either case, I'm not seeing any practical application to game design or play here. Unless you create a game that makes people punish their bad dice and the like.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            OK, I'm not quite sure how to define fetishization, but I figure it has something to do with the gamer's obsession with the physical bits of the game. So some examples of fetishization in action would be:
<ul>
<li>The physical act of handing a helping dice to another player in Burning Wheel</li>
<li>Placing dice on a conflict in Capes</li>
<li>That little stack of gift die the players start with in TSOY</li>
<li>Iconizing game elements onto cards, a la Magic the Gathering</li>
</ul>
Is that along the lines of the stuff you want to talk about?                        </div>

Which is a great idea.  <br/>

Anyway, compulsive collecting seems common among gamers, has fetishy undertones, and would be easy to exploit for financial gain.  Like, say, by extending necessary rules or vital meta-plot across multiple $30 hardbacks or something.  But that's crazy talk - no one would go for that.  Oh!  Or what if you had cards, and they were essentially random, and you had to buy a crap-ton of them to ... no, also crazy.  It's possible that, viewed through a certain lens, those marketing practices could be seen as taking advantage of collection fetish behavior.                        </div>

<p>Agreed. Ewen Cluney was also mentioning that this is taken to an even greater extent in certain subcultural markets in Japan, you care to weigh in on that, Ewen? Sanrio's seemingly-bizarre array of Hello Kitty branded objects come to mind here (a friend of mine owns a Hello Kitty toaster whose heating element is shaped such that it brands Hello Kitty's head onto your toast (this is my favorite toaster despite the fact that it toasts unevenly to the extent that the toast it makes is inedible)).</p>
<p>I don't personally think that eliminating fetish objects will make more actual play happen, but I do think that consciousness of fetish-impact can only improve our design work. I see a lot of good game designs dragged down by interface-fetish conservatism (i.e. "dice and character sheets are the way to do this", no examination of that decision appears to occur).</p>

                            Since we're starting with basic terminology here, I'll recommend Walter Benjamin's seminal essay on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Work_of_Art_in_the_Age_of_Mechanical_Reproduction" rel="nofollow">Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction</a> .<br/><br/>In particular, his concept of "<span style="color: #FF00CC;">aura</span>".<br/><br/>Wikipedia defines aura as: <i>the sense of awe and reverence one presumably experienced in the presence of unique works of art. According to Benjamin, this aura inheres not in the object itself but rather in external attributes such as its known line of ownership, its restricted exhibition, its publicized authenticity, or its cultural value. Aura is thus indicative of art's traditional association with primitive, feudal, or bourgeois structures of power and its further association with magic and (religious or secular) ritual. With the advent of art's mechanical reproducibility, and the development of forms of art (such as film) in which there is no actual original, the experience of art could be freed from place and ritual and instead brought under the gaze and control of a mass audience, leading to a shattering of the aura. "For the first time in world history," Benjamin wrote, "mechanical reproduction emancipates the work of art from its parasitical dependence on ritual.</i><br/><br/><br/>Of course, mechanical reproduction begat the "limited edition", autographed copy, rare variant cover. Reinstating  re-instating aura to otherwise-less-than-unique fetish objects.                        </div>

                            Let's see... In trying to work on an RPG inspired by the Superflat art movement -- which uses deconstructions of otaku culture to examine Japanese culture in general and the Japanese's relationship with art in particular -- I've been seeing some parallels between the two geek cultures, especially when comparing the Akiba-kei otaku and hardcore traditional D&amp;D gamers. Some day I (or possibly someone smarter than me) needs to write an essay about this. Anyway.<br/><br/>What I would call the core activities for otaku -- watching anime, reading manga, playing video games -- are somewhat similar to RPGs in that they require a relatively limited investment in physical goods, and those that are actually required are mostly 2-D content and the means to enjoy them. Most fans go quite a bit beyond their basic needs, however. You don't need lots of sourcebooks, minis, and sparkly dice to play D&amp;D, any more than you'd need to buy figures of Rei and Asuka in Chinese dresses holding pistols in order to sit down and watch Evangelion. The amount of time and money one can spend on these subdivisions of the base hobby is enormous, sometimes enough to dwarf the original in the first place. (I really need to spend more time roleplaying and less time on message boards about roleplaying...) Most don't complain about this though; they actively embrace it.<br/><br/>Part of what supports this is manufacturers playing to people who like having tidy shelves of neat stuff, the fetishization of the physical objects of a mostly mental hobby. Geek subcultures also highly prize arcane knowledge, however. For otaku there is a sort of evolving canon of necessary otaku knowledge -- if you want to be a true otaku, you've got to know your Gundam -- which is in turn reinforced by creative works with a marked tendency for referencing the canon (like in Keroro Gunsou, how Keroro is always building Gundam models, or Nakagomi's penchant for dressing up as Char in Akihabara@DEEP). I don't think it's by accident that it's games like D&amp;D and Exalted, which encourage and reward the accumulation of arcane knowledge, that struck a chord with geeks.<br/><br/>Evangelion is interesting from this perspective, since it very deliberately has a lot of this kind of technobabble and intrigue going on, but it very deliberately goes nowhere. And despite being very artistic, it was a mega-hit that saved Studio Gainax from going out of business, and they've been relentless in merchandising it any way they can over the past 10 years. Where some creators -- like the people behind Cowboy Bebop, or Bill Watterson -- shy away from excessive commoditization of their work, Gainax, being created by and for fans, embraces it.<br/><br/><br/>I was going to start a thread about this when I got my thoughts together more, but I really want to see what'll happen if we try to deconstruct D&amp;D the way that Superflat deconstructs otaku culture. I'm not sure what would come of it, but that "FARP" game that never got released (about a society founded on ironclad misinterpretations of the PHB), Drowning &amp; Falling, and the owlbear meme that swept through here a while back all point in that general direction.<br/><br/>That's all I've got for now.                        </div>

<p>Hmmm. I recall some of the early discussions of fetishes in RPGs, like Rob's Infamous Five, were focusing less on actual RPG procedures or props and more on the Color focus of the RPGs. In other words, something like Andy's Example # 1 (the obssessive need for an object,) but focused on dark elves or ninjas or something. I see fetish needs as being one of the primary causes of lasersharking: you can't just have a shark as a danger, you have to have that sci-fi add-on to make the game "better". It's also possibly a major force in the fantasy heartbreaker phenomenon: you can't just make an RPG about a focused concept, you have to throw in a whole lot of baggage you've accrued from years of playing your favorite RPG.</p>

I dig that. Also, it gets us past the possible trap of using the word fetish, which indicates pretty bizarre things at the extreme.<br/><br/>(I'm gonna follow the discussion for a bit, nothing more to add quite yet, but my wheels are spinning).                        </div>

                            Huh.  It's interesting that Curly is basic pointing at an earlier version of <a href="http://www.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/visualarts/Institutional-theory-artworld.html" rel="nofollow">the institutional theory of art</a>, which describes creative works as socially constructed things that only really have meaning when you have an "art world" (an audience) that knows how to appreciate them in the appropriate fashion.  Walter Benjamin was unfortunately wrong though, since people still attach high importance to objects, ownership, and structures of power even when creative works can be mass produced.  I think, to get at this, we need a real good analysis of roleplaying's artworld, our fandom, our market (which are all closely related ideas).<br/><br/>I know my brother and I are really interested in the recent movement towards promoting "comics as literature" instead of "comics as collectibles."  The comic collectors' market, which dominated in the late 80's and most of the 90's, didn't really care so much about the content of comics as long as you could buy them for cover price and, ideally, sell them down the road for cash.  But how much does WILDCATS <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> sell for nowadays?  The bottom dropped out and the comics market took a dive.  But if you're more interested in reading comics (because, hopefully, they're actually entertaining) rather than just owning them, things work differently.  Heck, you don't have to own them at all.  Comic libraries become a real possibility.  The whole approach is different.<br/><br/>Roleplaying games are slightly different, sure.  There isn't a huge market for a first printing of the Player's Handbook.  But there's still this strong emphasis on collectibility  and owning books, dice, miniatures, cards, and other related stuff.  There's this huge emphasis on the "industry" and publishers and the new book that's coming out and all the commercial aspects of the hobby that are not related to roleplaying at all.  THAT, to me, is fetishization, all this time spent focusing on something that's not really related to roleplaying.  Imagine what things would be like if it were more about "roleplaying as activity" instead of "roleplaying as publishing."  You wouldn't feel the need to buy things in order to play.  Whole swaths of things would become irrelevant.  And that, in my mind, is a community that I could get much more excited about.                        </div>

                            Andy, I don't find "fetishism" to be a perjorative.  I use it meaning the second "Fetish" definition and the third "Fetishism" definition.  To avoid the hassle of scrolling back up, those are:
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><br/><b>Fetish</b><br/>2.	any object, idea, etc., eliciting unquestioning reverence, respect, or devotion: to make a fetish of high grades.<br/><br/><b>Fetishism</b><br/>3.	blind devotion: a fetishism of sacrifice to one's children.<br/></blockquote>
Psychiatry has appropriated fetishes to refer to sexual matters; we don't have to.  The key thing for me is when a gamer invests a ton of import into something, often because it is lionized in game texts, without doing any research on the subject or gathering empirical data.  At that point, we have people attributing "unquestioning reverence" to these ideas and objects, propped up by a "blind devotion" that their attributions are correct.<br/><br/>As example, I offer up: the katana.  Oh, the katana is the best sword in the world, and should always have the highest damage rating in the game, and they're so freaking cool my character is going to weild two of them at the same time.  All of which doesn't even begin to touch on eastern fetishism and all the gamer wanks in the world who think that bushido is really cool when in fact it's a restrictive nightmare of an ideology that fashions you into a tool of despots and prevents you from being a human being.<br/><br/>I think fetishism is a big problem in gaming, inasmuch as gaming has "big problems."  Why do I think it's a big problem?  Cause it gets in the way of the role-taking and meaning-creating process that's core to what I appreciate in roleplaying.  If the katana, and whoever wields a katana, are always and automatically the best choice, then what's the point of trying on different roles or creating different meanings that aren't backed up by martial power?                        </div>

I seem to recall Tom Peters saying in one of his books that if your product is intangible, it's very important that you have good tangibles (business cards, brochures etc.) to distinguish yourself from your competitors, while if your product is tangible, you need good intangibles (customer service, etc.). I'm not sure if I believe him, but I offer it as a parallel.                        </div>

                            Hi!<br/>
  I have seen that by-and-large fetish, and its derivatives, are used to say "New ways are good, old ways are wrong" and I am not sure if some open discourse will really change that. I think that we have to accept that when someone uses a form of fetish that the discussion has been reduced to the level of hyperbole. It is sad to say so, but to expect more might be too much to expect from the internet, lol<br/>
  I think even a word with some amount of charge, or negative connotation, like "obsession" might be a better word to communicate this idea.<br/>
  Ultimately, I think this is an issue of what props are needed to play and how much time is devoted to handling them. Of course, I think there is more than one right answer, some games can benefit from props and handling time and for other games these things will only detract from the fun...<br/>
  Well, that's my 2 cents on the subject, no change please,<br/>

                            Howabout the fetishization of "indie"?  <br/>Or of the 'story games' label vs. 'role-playing game'?<br/> Or fetishization of a given designer's name recognition?<br/><br/>Perhaps it will be easier to contemplate this concept if we look at something other than rpgs.<br/>Here's an old <a href="http://www.bmxbasics.org/new/bmx0399.html" rel="nofollow">column</a> about the<br/>state of the BMX bicycle industry, at a time when "rider-owned" companies with rebellious-sounding <br/>names like "S&amp;M", "Homeless", and "Standard Bykes" were riding a wave of indie-cred, in a<br/>battle against the 'fat old men in suits' at GT, Redline, and Haro.<br/><br/>I think this will be a fairly painless case-study, because the smalltime bmx guys are faulted for things<br/>like poor customer service...  things that indie rpg designers often pride them themselves in doing-well online.<br/><br/>BMX has many lessons about fetish vs reality, if anyone's interested.  Over there, there's long been<br/>a fetishization of aluminum bike frames vs. cro-moly steel.  (The former is ostensibly 'lighter and stronger',<br/>but rather than absorbing shock in a springy manner-- aluminum tends to shatter like glass.)  And there's <br/>a strong BMX fetish for untested high tech novelty <a href="http://www.bmxbasics.org/new/bmx0400.html" rel="nofollow">gimmicks</a>.  In a sport where children risk becoming<br/>quadrapalegics, no less.                        </div>
