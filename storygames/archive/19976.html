It is more on the traditional side of gaming. But it has a formal Respectability system which is your standing in the family. A respectability check (rolled secretly) determines if the bosses try to whack you when you do anything against the family or break the code in an any way. There are no rules for escalating tension (like I said it is on the traditional side) but every character has a Personal Goal and family goal each adventure. Both are secret and the family goal is given by the GM based on the needs of the family (and it can include killing a fellow player character). This really adds to the sense of paranoia. Think Donnie Brasco and Goodfellas meet The Sopranos. There is also a racket sub system. We do handle promotion and rank but that is mostly as guidelines. The guide to organized crime goes into that in more depth (it also offers a more detailed optional racket sub system). <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441676/#Comment_441676" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-19T08:52:09+00:00" title="January 19, 2015  8:52AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mobsters ( <a href="http://www.burgergames.com/G1.PDF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.burgergames.com/G1.PDF</a> ) by Ville Vuorela is a traditional roleplaying game for managing and expanding a mafia family in some specific city of USA during the prohibition.
