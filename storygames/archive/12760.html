You'll see a couple of them in the future, through more official channels. But this one... this one I couldn't wait to show you. This one needs some actual play to sharpen its edges and, I figured, why just try it out myself when the Internet is full of great <i>Fiasco</i> players like you?<br/><br/>It's called "All The Damn Time." Here's the gist of it: Sam Howard is a man unstuck in time. Some kind of quantum-level shenanigans have him traveling to and from key moments in his life. But if one Sam Howard managed to mess things up the first time, who\u2019s to say that even more meddling Sam Howards can make things any better? Will Sam improve his life by futzing with his own history or will he turn a life of perfectly ordinary mistakes into a paradoxical catastrophe?<br/><br/>Who plays Sam Howard, by the way? <b>You all do.</b> You play Sams from different points in time. <br/><br/><a href="http://wordstudio.net/thegist/?p=2237" rel="nofollow">Drop by my site and pick up the playset.</a> It's free! And actual-play notes may be incorporated into a future edition for wider distribution.<br/><br/>Thanks in advance!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286936/#Comment_286936" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-17T09:06:26+00:00" title="August 17, 2010  9:06AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds like it's made of nuts and awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286940/#Comment_286940" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-17T09:17:32+00:00" title="August 17, 2010  9:17AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is brain-destroyingly cool.

Even if I had played it once with my own group, that'd hardly be enough information to go on when writing advice on how to run the thing.

So most of the stuff that has happened happens "to him" instead of him "driving the action". In other words, he's generally a nice guy doing what you would expect a nice guy to do. And therefore EVERYONE is playing a nice guy...there is really noone chasing a need in a completely desperate manner.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I'm not sure if this is because of the subject matter where there is this sort of need to explain the time traveling linkages, or fear of stepping on each other's timelines, or this is something that the playset created. I know that there has been a concerted effort to keep the science and the world "realistic" as opposed to following ridiculous plots. Or just the player's themselves who are pretty new.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has been an interesting change of pace playing Fiasco is a more quiet and retrospective manner. however it does make the awarding of the dice a little harder to figure out since there's nothing like polar bear rapes going on. I'm sort of fearful that the tilt might change this tone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327540/#Comment_327540" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-02T11:10:07+00:00" title="June  2, 2011 11:10AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have a conversation about tone and what you want.

The set's designed to be decidedly subdued for the subject matter, with the understanding that <i>Fiasco</i> itself, the playset premise, and eventually the Tilt will all add some more gonzo elements to the proceedings. If you end up with a more contemplative, slow-burn tale, just embrace it for as long as it's satisfying everyone. This set requires a lot of negotiation between players to work, so wear your heart on your sleeve when the Tilt comes and let everyone know that you think things should maintain some of that pre-Tilt tone. It might even work! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I've never seen or heard of actual play, outside of your forum game, that takes so much care to make sure the various Sams are recognizably the same dude. More often, I see people play him as similar guys, with a lot in common, altered dramatically by years and mayhem. I dig what I'm seeing in that thread, for sure\u2014it's one of several great ways to play with the set, in my opinion. <br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Will                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
