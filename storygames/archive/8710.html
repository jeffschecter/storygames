I played this game at <i>HolmCon</i> this weekend (a con in a town in Norway). <br/><br/>None of us knew the game very well. I had read it 1,5 times, and taken some notes to facilitate playing it (no real overview of the game-flow presented within the game-text). <br/><br/>The game lets the players make the world first, in a way that we all found very entertaining. We opted for a fun twist of space-opera mixed in with some social-democratic cliches from the sixties (Labour Party governed Norway being attacked by small Martians, and an appliance-crazy housewife figuring as one of the great powers of the game ...). This kind of silly play is ok sometimes. We were 6 tired players after a long weekend of serious gaming, so we opted for easy, laidback fun.<br/><br/>Jumping form setting-creation to character-building went well. The players were experienced and took the simple format in stride, building characters well suited to the setting, with fun names and traits. We struggled a bit with putting all info on the sheet, but in the end all of us had a full overview over the characters. We were ready to play!<br/><br/>Playing the game felt clumsy. None of us had played it before, and even though we had some very strong players around the table (amongst them the designers of <b>Until we sink</b> and <b>Itras By</b>), it failed to produce real flow. Some scenes were hilariously fun, but not due to the method, more due to us being as inventive and character-driven as usual. Some of the players did not use resources at all, due to them being content with all the happenings in the game anyway. And perhaps due to the flow of the game being, even though it was quite simple, hard to grasp. The game need flow-charts for all players to have, on a sheet of its own.<br/><br/>At the end we tired, and found a suitable place to end it. Most of us found it fun, but clumsy.<br/>___________________________________________<br/><br/><b>Epitaph ...</b><br/>This kind of story-games is not my favorite kind of role-playing. I have seen a lot of them the last years, and have heard others praise them no-end. I do not agree to the praise of games that let the players be "free" to produce a never-ending stream of sillyness. For me <i>Oskrivna blad</i> place itself in the shelf besides <i>In a Wicked Age</i>, and will be left there with their high tales, not to be played often by me.<br/><br/>Games such as this one, are prone to produce sillyness more than anything else, in my experience. Although some silly laughs can be fun from time to time, it is not what I aim for in my gaming any more. Objectively such games may be argued to facilitate more serious gameplay too, but they seldom do. <br/><br/>I will try <i>Oskrivna blad</i> once more, and aim for a serious theme, but I am afraid it will fail to deliver any gameplay of significant quality for me.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192712/#Comment_192712" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-16T03:44:53+00:00" title="February 16, 2009  3:44AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have not played Oskrivna blad, so I can not comment on the game as such.  But the Epitaph contained one sentence that raised my interest.<br/><br/><span style="color: #CC0066;">"I do not agree to the praise of games that let the players be "free" to produce a never-ending stream of sillyness."</span><br/><br/>Could you give a few examples of games that do not allow players to produce sillyness? Preferably games that you also enjoy.<br/><br/>I can sort of relate to what you are writing about.  I have played lots and lots of Universalis, and in my experience the first session with new players always turns silly. The freedom makes people want to test the limits of the game, which usually ends up in sillyness.  But once that first game has been played and everyone knows how it works there are great stories to be had, as long as you have a shared creative agenda.<br/><br/>For that reason I avoid playing Universalis with people that I don't expect another chance to play again with later. The first session will be 'wasted', but that is what is needed to learn the rules and the form of the game. <br/><br/>I think that the sillyness is a matter of attitude amongst the participants rather than something that is inherent in a specific genre of games. (Not counting Toon, where sillyness is the objective of the game.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/olepeder" title="olepeder"><img alt="olepeder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/olepeder">olepeder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192728/#Comment_192728" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-16T05:48:48+00:00" title="February 16, 2009  5:48AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's what I posted over in the other thread, before I saw this one: \n<blockquote>It would be cool if my game would be played in Norway, but I'm not too concered about sales (I don't make money from it).</blockquote> HolmCon was this weekend, and Tomas ran Oskrivna blad. I attended as a player, and have not read the game itself. I'm very, very fond of the mechanics for creating the setting and intrigues. Matthijs; we might want to look into this scheme for setting up a campaign for our next Draug-group-thing. <br/><br/>To me, actual gameplay seemed a bit clunkier than I would have preferred, but this might be down to us not being familiar with the rules.<br/><br/>Our concept was "catastrophe film as envisioned by Norwegian state TV sometime in the sixties." There were Martians, Stay Behind groups, desperate housewives with high tech appliances, The Museum of Geobiology and The Norwegian Labour Party. Many enjoyable moments, but with the traditional GM-free Story Game tendency of generating lots of loose threads.

(It's no secret. They are silly people.)<br/><br/>Archipelago was written quite specifically to address this problem - at least, I see it as a problem. It's got techniques that players can use to keep their vision united, to stop the game from spinning freely in random directions; it also has techniques to make sure that if someone gets too weird, the other players can guide them back on the track.<br/><br/>I kind of see this issue from two sides. On the one hand, it's pretty obvious that if a game crashes due to silliness, the players have themselves to blame for going silly in the first place. On the other hand, I've never seen Shock: go silly in the same way as some other GM-less games do. So some games are probably more effective in creating emergent serious play, so to speak.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192758/#Comment_192758" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-16T09:37:03+00:00" title="February 16, 2009  9:37AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Oh: One thing that seems to go paired with silly play is pastiche.

When writing that rule, I had in mind a playtest many years ago of "Will the Emperor Fall" with Ole Peder and Magnus (who you played "Oskrivna Blad" with)... <br/><br/>The rules on domains and vetoes make sure that there's a "the buck stops here" instance for the most important parts of the setting. "Oh, and at the court of Bibliolalia everyone farts before dinner!" "No."<br/><br/>The destiny points are to make sure that play has a goal, instead of roaming freely in random directions based on momentary whims.<br/><br/>(Again, I'm not commenting on Oskrivna Blad at all, since I haven't read it nor played it!

To a point, I agree that there is little preventing the game to get silly. There's the dictator rule, which is when the group overrides the individual (should not be used lightly) and there's the description words for the setting, created in the very beginning. For me, that's where I get the authority to say "is that really appropriate in this game?".<br/><br/>Part of this lack of constraitns is that it's not a problem I have experienced much. I've seen it happen when playing with a newly formed group, but the game is written for campaign play, and as such played generally with a cohesive group. <a href="http://www.rollspel.nu/forum/ubbthreads.php/ubb/showflat/Number/604130" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is, for those who get Swedish, a play report of an independent playtest of the game, with slightly different rules (no Dilemmas, for example), and it might not be profound and deep, but I wouldn't call it silly. It is, incidentally, also set on Mars.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's my two cents on the sillyness thing. There isn't much in the game to prevent it, no, because in my experience, that only happens in one-shot games. Though Oskrivna blad works for one-shots, the point economy is really meant for extended play, and the game is built with that in mind. I'm more interested in the failings of the point economy (people not using resources sounds like they're simply not calling for conflicts, which is, by the way, the default method for handling people introducing unwanted stuff, and also an important method to produce unexpected outcomes) and the "clumsiness". What, specifically, needs flowcharts?<br/><br/>Might part of the dissonance result from my liking games that are as tools, and don't direct play but rather lets you form the play you are creating in your mind?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_192813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192813/#Comment_192813" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-16T16:39:31+00:00" title="February 16, 2009  4:39PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I consider role playing games tools for making stories.

Of all the "make-a-roleplaying-setting-quickly" techniques I've tried, this is my favourite. When we actually started playing the experience faltered a bit, but there were still lots of fun moments.<br/><br/>Our main problem, I think, was a lack of cohesiveness, a feeling that we weren't getting anywhere, the realization that we weren't succeeding in tying these fun single scenes into an interesting story. Of course, on a good day roleplayers who are used to that sort of thing can improvise an interesting and cohesive story out of nothing. When we don't strike gold, though, I prefer to get some improvisational help from the system, and I dont' think we got enough of that here. Also, the economy system felt somewhat superfluous. Then again, I haven't actually read the game, so it's very possible that there's some part of it that we overlooked.<br/><br/>All in all it seems like a good game, but it still didn't quite hit the mark for me.<br/><br/>(Concerning silliness: I don't think that was the problem. True, it's my experience that GM-less games often become silly, but in this case we actually <i>set out</i> to be silly, so we can't blame the system.
