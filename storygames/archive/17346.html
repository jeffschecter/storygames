I have never played it myself, just heard it mentioned online. There are also games like Storycubes and Nanofictionary. These type of games do not really seemed to be aimed at RPG Gamers, but I imagine they might appeal to some people here.<br/><br/>Any other non-roleplaying Storygames you know of?

While being a really good game-game.<br/><br/>(I bring it up because I think that's kind a common standard in most potentially-story-making games outside of roleplaying.

Something like "take turns writing one sentence, adding to the previous one" is another example of the same thing.<br/><br/>I know of very few storytelling games (without roleplaying) that do create good, moving, coherent stories. There have been many attempts made in Iron Chef game design competitions and the like, but Universalis is probably the only published, consistently well-reviewed game of this sort.<br/><br/>However, there is a fellow in Montreal named Jonathan Benn who has long been at work at designing such games. His main project is called "Muse", and it's a very fun and functional game currently in its final or near-final draft (you'd have to ask him). <br/><br/>When he first posed the challenge to me ("I want a game that tells good stories without roleplaying!") about five years ago, I designed a game called <i>Musette</i>, which works very well, and I've been playing that game in its final form for a number of years now. Both games are very easy for non-gamers to pick up and play. If anyone is interested, I can post the rules document for my version of the game; it's not currently available online.<br/><br/>There was <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/5514/muse-a-new-storytelling-game" rel="nofollow">a thread about Muse</a> a while back, as well as a <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/15223/muse-vs-universalis/p1" rel="nofollow">Muse/Universalis comparison</a>, and the latest version of the rules (I believe) are available for free <a href="http://www.benn.ca/muse" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>There is also the family of <a href="http://hamsterpress.net/" rel="nofollow">Engle Matrix Games</a>, some of which definitely fit this definition.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.evilhat.com/home/happy-birthday-robot-3" rel="nofollow">Happy Birthday Robot</a> also deserves a nod of the hat here. Whether it "tells a good story" or not is up to you! (I could easily argue for either side on this one.)<br/><br/>Edit: 1,001 Nights is an RPG where you tell stories "in character". So the majority of gameplay is spent in "storytelling mode", but you're supposed to playing characters telling the stories (like, to some extent, in Baron Munchausen). I suppose it's an edge case!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393008/#Comment_393008" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-10T11:48:21+00:00" title="October 10, 2012 11:48AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If everyone plays aspects of a single character, does that violate "non-roleplaying" requirement?<br/><br/>[What's the name of that game where everyone's portraying one character...? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> ]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393011/#Comment_393011" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-10T11:54:58+00:00" title="October 10, 2012 11:54AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Any other non-roleplaying Storygames you know of?

I've played games like Once Upon a Time, and found them entertaining but otherwise unfulfilling (it's hard to create much of a meaningful story, the game rules don't help you very much). So I'd consider them more like "party games" or "entertainments".<br/><br/>I've played <i>Muse</i> and <i>Musette</i> quite a bit, and had quite a bit of fun with both of those games! They're based on similar rules, just with a slightly different focus. <i>Muse</i> is more of a long-form story with a focus on plot, like a Hollywood film, whereas <i>Musette</i> is a little shorter and more intense and character-focused (you often end up making surprising judgements on the characters involved as the story wraps up). Both games reliably create a very strong climax and resolution, and are very easy to learn and play.*<br/><br/><br/>*: In theory! There has never been a blind playtest of either set of rules, to my knowledge. But games with the creator present have always gone easily and smoothly, so I see no reason it wouldn't be the same without the creator, unless there are errors or unclear directions in the text(s).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393023/#Comment_393023" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-10T13:10:09+00:00" title="October 10, 2012  1:10PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Edit: 1,001 Nights is an RPG where you tell stories "in character".

So in some sense it is a game within a game.  You play the courtier telling stories, and that courtier plays a role in each story told.  By the rules of the game, your courtier is defined by what you envy in each of the other PCs, and this informs how you create the story you are telling.  You also define qualities for every sense about your courtier, to make them seem more vivid.  <br/><br/>The game I organized at Big Bad Con this past weekend was one of the best for me, with lots of role-playing of our characters that spilled out to outside the stories.  We stayed more solidly in character than most tabletop games that I know of.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393073/#Comment_393073" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-10T18:46:27+00:00" title="October 10, 2012  6:46PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kind of obvious, but Microscope can be played without roleplaying -- there are scenes, and one option is to have people temporarily take on roles in the scenes, but there is also an option for the active player to simply monologue the result of the scene, and the game works fine either way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jda1974" title="jda1974"><img alt="jda1974" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jda1974">jda1974</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393075/#Comment_393075" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-10T19:03:18+00:00" title="October 10, 2012  7:03PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 10, 2012 7:05PM by jda1974.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Several card games I like have already been mentioned (Gloom, Once Upon a Time).

Each set is based on a different b-movie genre (my favorite is the 70's themed Bell Bottomed Badasses on the Mean Streets of Funk), and you can mix different titles together.<br/><br/>* Ace Detective: Not out yet, but one I've Kickstartered. It appears to be similar to Once Upon a Time as far as laying cards down to continue the story, but it has more structured mechanics. The theme is detective noir.
