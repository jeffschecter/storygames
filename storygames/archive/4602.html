This is the only book that you really need to buy, and the only one that I personally recommend (though the Book of Grey isn't bad).<br/><br/>Story Engine is a generic rule set spawned from the system that drives Maelstrom Storytelling. This standalone product is sometimes referred to as "Version 2" of the Story Engine (Version 1 being that present in MS).<br/><br/>Decartha Prime is a setting book (it and Tales From the Empire were the two books that I never bought for the line).<br/><br/>Book of Grey is a digest-sized supplement for Maelstrom written from the perspective of a setting resident, and also (IIRC) contains the 'Quick Play' rules known as "Story Bones".<br/><br/>Tales From the Empire is a setting book (for the city of Diodet) and contains minor system revisions/additions.<br/><br/>Precis Intermedia now owns the rights to the game and offers all books <i>except</i> the Book of Grey as PDFs or POD books.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106578/#Comment_106578" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-04T14:43:28+00:00" title="November  4, 2007  2:43PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lacuna: You're a Mystery Agent, descending into a mind-world.

The rules, alas, while not bad, are already fading from my mind, leaving only vague impressions.  I think if I were to ever run the setting I'd probably port it over to CN's Solar System (there being a fair number of thematic similarities between the Maelstrom and TSoY settings which I think would make it an especially good fit).

Like, where I sit down, not sure what to expect, and come away thinking, "Wow, this totally changed my thinking about what a roleplaying game can be about."  Not after reading the whole book, not after thinking about it for a while and coming to some realization, not even in the way that <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> made me think, "Wow, this is the tightest design I have ever read."  I mean games that, after reading the first couple chapters, I had to put the book down and just think about it for a while, realizing the ramifications of what I'd read, before continuing.<br/><br/>These games are <i>Continuum</i> and <i>Nobilis</i>.  One is the greatest time travel game ever written (though one of the most paperwork intensive to play), the other is the crazy love child of <i>Ars Magicka</i>, <i>Amber</i>, <i>Mage</i>, and <i>Kult</i>.  I thought roleplaying was, you know, this big &lt;----------&gt;.
