How do you usually map a given locale into zones? Let's say I want to replicate something like the scene on the cover of the SotC book: some PCs are on the zeppelin, some are in mid-air, some are struggling with an gorilla on a bi-plane. How would you map that scene into zones? Would large distances be handled with lots of zones or just border values?<br/><br/>Also, how do you normally represent zones? I usually bring a small whiteboard with me when I GM; I figured I would map things out on that for all the players to see. Seems like one could even use minis for such a thing...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70857/#Comment_70857" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-21T11:57:11+00:00" title="May 21, 2007 11:57AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite>How big are zones?

I tend to size them according to different "pockets" of action. So, on the SotC cover, the zeppelin, the bi-plane, and the air between them are each a zone in my mind. In a social conflict taking place at a large ball, different cliques of people might be zones.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70864/#Comment_70864" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-21T12:07:37+00:00" title="May 21, 2007 12:07PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I were doing the cover scene, the zeppelin would probably be a few zones itself ("above" and "below" at the very least, probably the cupola, too), and there would be several air zones for the bi-plane to move around in. The plane would be a vehicle (not a zone) in that layout.<br/><br/>I like a zone to have something interesting in it, and to possibly have at least one unusual border.<br/><br/>So, first, sketch your map. Then put some interesting stuff in it: props, weird surfaces, lighting/darkness, etc. Then you can chop it up with zone borders and give some of the borders some interest: height difference, visual barrier/concealment, stuff like that.<br/><br/>I like to think conceptually, or like a movie set. What areas will make for cool shots and stunts? Those are your zones.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Faerieloch" title="Faerieloch"><img alt="Faerieloch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Faerieloch">Faerieloch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70944/#Comment_70944" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-21T17:09:21+00:00" title="May 21, 2007  5:09PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 21, 2007 5:10PM by Faerieloch.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think of zones the way their described in the book: if you can get to the person *now* you're in the same zone.  If you have to say something like "I run towards the villain and *stab*", you're probably one zone away because you have to move first to get to the villain.  If you can't run and stab, but you can throw a knife, you're either one or two zones away (one, if you just want to be cool, two if you just can't get there NOW to do something).  If you can shoot someone (or have a fantastic throwing arm) and nothing else, you're likely three zones away.  If all else fails, default to the 10ftx10ft room, conceptually.<br/><br/>In the same room, but there's a table in the way, I would say is a barrier since you have to dramatically jump over it or run around it to get at the villain.<br/><br/>Physically, the same room (unless it's big like a warehouse or ballroom) is the same zone.  The next room is one zone away.  Two rooms away is two zones away.  Inside the shack is one zone, outside the shack is another.  The bi-plane is one zone, the zeppelin is one zone, the Jet Black is in a zone all to himself unless he's flying right next to one of the other things.  I would say the gap between the two is a barrier simply because it's hard to jump from one to the other.  Conversely, you can up the difficulty of jumping from one to the other 'cause hey, you're flying!<br/><br/>Hope this makes some amount of sense!<br/><br/>--Nancy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
