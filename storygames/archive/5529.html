Again, the system delivered what it promised: intra-player conflict.<br/><br/>I won't go deep into the details (although players, feel free if you want to post about it) but it was tragic.  Especially for poor Hadish.  Poor, poor Hadish.<br/><br/>This time was by far my longest session (almost 5 hours).  Despite the fact that there was a lot of stabbing it took a while to get to the stabbing.<br/><br/>Almost no PCs got their best interests - the one who did turned into a GIANT villainess.  Like, "I've taken the power of a god!" psycho spurned lover bitch villainess.  <br/><br/>But most of all, I really liked the ability to say "hey, let's play an RPG this afternoon" and although it wasn't the afternoon for everybody... we still got to play, and it was great.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20Ulricht" title="Thomas Ulricht"><img alt="Thomas Ulricht" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20Ulricht">Thomas Ulricht</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124101/#Comment_124101" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-03T08:30:54+00:00" title="February  3, 2008  8:30AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like your Play Now initiative.

I decided that Walita should be one.  The dagger came out and everybody's dice were chipped away.  There was a point where everyone was one lost conflict away from being out of the session except for Walita.  She had full dice (she did through the end of the session).  It was actually quite an excellent coincidence of narrative events and mechanics.  She had just absorbed the divine essence and become a goddess and at the same time, no one had sufficient dice to stop her.  She then tried to force Hadish to stay with her, but he had just enough dice left to take the exhaustion and escape her, leaving her alone forever.<br/><br/>Hadish started the session where Walita ended up-- cursed.  He couldn't touch another living person and was cursed for the murders he had done.  Like Walita, he loved someone who had no interest in him.  Hadish ended up being battered by pretty much everyone.  Only the emissary Xi Feng didn't really have any direct designs against him and he still opposed Hadish because Hadish tried to scatter the divine essence so no one could have it (Xi Feng wanted it as well).  Walita ended up bargaining with Xi Feng for his life and he agreed to her having the divine power.  She contemplated for a moment to go back on her word and kill him anyway now that she was eternal, but saw that his rival Ipash, though bloodied by her knife earlier, still hungered for Xi Feng's life and that if he left, Xi Feng would meet his dagger.<br/><br/>Sure enough Xi Feng crossed paths with Ipash, but it was Ipash who died as a result of that conflict.  So Xi Feng left with Amira (who wanted him) and Hadish (who wanted Amira but could touch no living person).  This left Walita with her priestesses but utterly alone (both her love Hadish and her best friend Amira had rejected her).  So the Temple of the River God became a dark place where the priestesses would kidnap young men who resembled Hadish to sacrifice them to Walita to appease her unfulfilled desires for first love.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_124230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124230/#Comment_124230" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-03T21:28:09+00:00" title="February  3, 2008  9:28PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hate it so bad that I missed this.

I think we had a bit of a problem with character knowledge.  One character didn't want to be seen by anyone and other characters had best interests related to that character.  It also wasn't great that when people did discover him, Hadish's first move was always to run/disappear.  Once it was finally established that everyone knew about him, things started coming together a lot faster.  Everyone got into the same place and it all went wrong... so very, very wrong.<br/><br/>It was a great game even if it wasn't a short story.   I think it was the right length for *that* story, but it would have been cool to have two chapters in that time.<br/><br/>Also, I suspect using map tools in terms of spacial relationships while cool, probably dragged things out a bit.  In IAWA, how far people are from on another, the floorplan and other such stuff is largely irrelevant.  Aggressive scene framing takes care of all of that.  Instead up popping up a floor plan, perhaps an image of a ziggurat for the temple, a picture of a boat, a picture of a forest path.  That sort of thing.

It's meaningless if someone is 10 or 50 feet away if I declare that I'm rushing and stabbing them.  They're opposition in the conflict might be-- I get out of there before he gets anywhere near me, but it's time to roll dice.  And if I win, however it goes down, exhaustion or injury will happen if that's my goal.  Stab! Stab! Stab!  I didn't have a great grasp of the game system going into our game, but now that I have played it and gone back and read the rules again, now I see that all that stuff related to who is where is meaningless.  I get that you were teaching other people how to play (and thanks for that) though.  The answer to "but where am I?" is "where do you want to be?" and everyone else gets to say yes or roll dice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_124408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124408/#Comment_124408" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-04T16:08:02+00:00" title="February  4, 2008  4:08PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's important though that there is a visual in front of the players, especially with Skype.  99.9% of computer use is with monitor on and looking at it, and when you don't have that visual I think it's very tempting for people to fire up Solitaire or check their e-mail.  <br/><br/>The other thing is I really have felt lost in games where I can't see anything.

My character "escaped" in a scene, then I moved him back around to place him on a rooftop, overlooking the remaining two characters. I was able to communicate that my character was still involved in the scene without having to go "hey guys, my character is right there, overlooking you." (for the record, I did say something to that effect, but it was taken in stride, as they already realized that I was there.)<br/><br/>Our session was also somewhat long, but that's probably more my fault than anything else. I'm a little bit of a system monkey.. Even if I'm not necessarily trying to game the system for maximum advantage, I want to know how everything works so that I make any decisions, either for maximum effectiveness or otherwise, from a position of knowledge. I asked a LOT of questions during set up, and more than a few during the play of the game, as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/M%20Eryesen" title="M Eryesen"><img alt="M Eryesen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/M%20Eryesen">M Eryesen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124419/#Comment_124419" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-04T17:34:47+00:00" title="February  4, 2008  5:34PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah, I felt totally free to move my token, the tokens of non-statted NPCs, etc.,.<br/><br/>More than anything, the sessions going long are probably more to do with all of us who are new to the game than anything else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_124428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124428/#Comment_124428" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-04T18:42:00+00:00" title="February  4, 2008  6:42PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The reason I posted this thing and called it "Further Success!" is that I was impressed that we managed to go from zero to game off of the play now list.
