This is intentional!  When you\u2019re under pressure, feeling like crap, or just having a bad day, it\u2019s much \u201ceasier\u201d to show contempt than compassion, and the game works that way.  Just so you know, 7-9 is always a \u201cweak success\u201d and any time a move has a \u201cbad\u201d result, it\u2019ll be listed as a \u201c<b>miss</b>\u201d, along with the roll result and, unless there\u2019s actually mechanics listed, whatever is written in that \u201c<b>miss</b>\u201d section is simply secret code to the MC to make a move as hard and direct as they like\u2026<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452022/#Comment_452022" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-02T04:25:14+00:00" title="April  2, 2016  4:25AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting stuff.

I'm going to assume you're looking at source material like Gray's Anatomy and House. A typical doctor show might have the protagonist facing a patient with a mysterious illness, while also having to deal with a nasty breakup and a suspicious administrator who thinks the protagonist is unfit for their job.  How would these moves be used in those kind of situations? <br/><br/>This is a subject of much interest to me since I work in a hospital and once spent a month trying abortively to create a Fiasco hospital playset.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soyosauce" title="soyosauce"><img alt="soyosauce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soyosauce">soyosauce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452753/#Comment_452753" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-28T18:59:53+00:00" title="April 28, 2016  6:59PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seems neat! I love Pbta, one thing I suggest though, would be to step aside from what is going to happen on a miss. Even if it's things go poorly etc, the MC will handle misses. Sometimes you could say in addition to what the MC - this happens. But I think overall it's unnecessary, the fiction is going to move forward with the appropriate move from the MC.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
