I really liked getting the opinions and experiences of people who apparently had only played "old school" rpgs, as that pretty much describes a lot of the people I play with. Im wondering if its a valid game to play with 2 people though...</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: reaction</cite>Yes.</blockquote>\nThat's my experience too. It works surprisingly well head-to-head, so long as you stick to the rules and play your cards close to the vest. Don't give away your ideas until you spring them. It may even be more fun than usual because you're riffing straight off of what the other person just said (if you want). It can create a very tight creative feedback loop.<br/><br/>Anybody else have two-player Microscope anecdotes?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366840/#Comment_366840" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T11:31:23+00:00" title="March 12, 2012 11:31AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Holy crap does it ever work!!!<br/><br/>The wife and I decided to give it a shot.

I did a head to head thing where we did something like Palladium's Nightbane and an eclipse struck that transformed people into disgusting monsters. Our main focus for most of the game was a guy who transformed in a hulking beast with fangs, lost his wife, but then became a celebrity and professional wrestler. He died thinking about her, though, and wondering what happened. It was really cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367247/#Comment_367247" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-13T14:27:37+00:00" title="March 13, 2012  2:27PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That game sounds excellent, Kenny! I think using an existing story as a springboard is a great idea.<br/><br/>My best two-player game started off with the Nazi's winning World War II (like they do) and slowly dominating the world. Because the Nazi's didn't get shut down by the Allies, the German people had to eventually reconcile how they felt about what they had done, all on their own. Without external enemies, the mainstream government backs well away from extremism, which of course gives birth to secret inner circle of old school, diehard fascists, The Ring of Fenris. Surprisingly thoughtful story, along with some near future iron sci fi machines-of-war action.<br/><br/>Bret, was that the game with the famous exchange:<br/><br/>you: (blow up beautiful city)<br/>her: "Why would you do that?!?"<br/>you: "Because I'm evil! Let's play!"<br/><br/>Because I still love that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367251/#Comment_367251" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-13T14:47:52+00:00" title="March 13, 2012  2:47PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That wasn't me!
