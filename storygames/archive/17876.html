Andy gave me some great tips but they were the sort of tips that only made sense to me after I\u2019d run through the setup on my own. <br/><br/>I\u2019m coming from a lot of Burning Wheel, so the BW-ish elements of TBZ really spoke to me: explicit flags and character-driven drama, specifically. But it\u2019s kind of an illusion. Since the GM is obligated to provide a scenario-specific flag, a \u201cDestiny\u201d, to the players, that requires the GM bring at least an outline of a scenario.  And that means prep!<br/><br/>I had a heck of a time working out the right sequence for my prep. I wanted to show off the variety of character options and let the game be character-driven, but then you need a scenario/situation/problem already in place as well as little scenes sketched out to bring each character up to speed. I ended up treating the whole exercise as prep for a convention game: I picked a subset of 5 pregens (for a 4-player + GM game), wrote Destiny goals/emotions/whatevers for each, and then worked out their Zero Act introductions backwards.<br/><br/>I settled on a rough outline: A mysterious gang is harassing the coastal villages of the kingdom. It\u2019s suspected that a nearby kingdom, after several years of an uneasy truce, is waging a new war-by-proxy by equipping the gang with materiel and even a yoroi armour. The pregens are mercenaries, hired by the Regent for plausible deniability to go in and be aggressive problem-solvers. The Regent is also sending in her daughter and the family\u2019s own armour (because I assumed nobody would pass up the sweet ass armour pilot pregen).<br/><br/>Once I had that outline in place, I looked through my short list of \u201ceasy\u201d pregens and their baked-in Fates for guidance toward their Zero Act scenes. The armour princess got a right-now scene (introduced to her armour and then instructed to blow away some convicted criminals set loose in the countryside), the samurai got a mix of past-and-present scenes (first to show off losing something precious, then flash-forward to receiving the mission as a result of the sacrifice the samurai made \u2013 this was possibly a mistake but I had no idea how else to tie in the samurai\u2019s fates and the situation). The annelidist and the kujin cyborg both had flashback-type scenes.<br/><br/>Total prep time was around 4 hours. That was me picking the \u201ceasy\u201d pregens, reading up on their special rules, looking at their fates, working out the scenario, and doodling up Zero Act scenes. Choosing characters and talking through what\u2019s actually on the character sheets was probably 30 minutes.<br/><br/>In actual play, the Zero Act turned out to be kind of tricky for me the first time. My main dissonance is in the admonition to keep the Zero Act short (as in 5-6 minutes, for reals), and providing enough breathing room for the player to find their legs and earn some Aiki chits. For our first go, I ran the Zero Act with scene judge rules: the player to the left was given 3 chits and the session log, and instructed to pass chits in real time. I figured this was a nice way to individually teach everyone how to be a good Audience member.<br/><br/>Well, earning a chit every couple minutes is a pretty torrid pace to keep up with, both as the focus character and as the scene judge. When my first player started out kind of timid, I made it clear that TBZ is a total ham-fest, and that if he wants to earn chits he needs to play to his Fates, hard. Still, he needed some breathing room. So it took more like 15 minutes to give him time and material to work with to get his 3 chits. The princess\u2019 Destiny: Defeat Ebon Hell, the armour being used by the gang to terrorize the coastal villages.<br/><br/>The annelidist was better. It was a flashback to when he first got infected, and his village (which will later be revealed to be the latest village razed by the gang) rejects him for being gross. Still, I had to keep prompting him with NPC input to get him to really ham it up. This might have also been some shyness on the part of the next scene judge \u2013 I would prompt the judge to pay up whenever I felt like he was being tight-fisted (this was a recurring problem, probably BW damage on our part!). The annelidist\u2019s Destiny:  protect the people of Sendai.<br/><br/>Then we did the samurai, who started in the past fighting for the Regent during the last big flare-up. He\u2019s faced with either losing his brother to the war or his wife to raiders, so chooses loyalty to the Regent and lets his wife die. He gets a promotion and decorations, leaves the military, goes in for samuraization so he\u2019ll never lose anyone again. Then we flash forward, and he and his gang (the annelidist and the kijin, who hasn\u2019t yet had his scene) are brought again before the Regent to receive their secret mission of stopping the gang and proving that they\u2019re working for the Regent\u2019s old enemies. Destiny: Ensure the safe return of Ghost Light, the family\u2019s armour entrusted to the princess. (This I thought was more interesting than \u201cgo beat on the gang,\u201d but I might have been a bit too clever here.)<br/><br/>Finally we do the kijin, and I think his scene was about perfect. We start with him getting blown to pieces in the same final battle the samurai fought as he was losing his wife. Then he\u2019s getting mechanized by the \u201cbad guy\u201d enemy Regent, who turns out to be a perfectly decent dude on the other side of the war. Then he goes home, and his wife is horrified at his transformation. He gets physical and threatening, and she leaves him. Destiny: Make Kugo, his old master and probable puppetmaster behind the gang, pay for the pain he\u2019s caused.<br/><br/>Zero Act took maybe\u2026 I want to say 90 minutes total. Lots of talking about how to be a scene judge, talking about what to do with aiki chits later, why it\u2019s important to play toward them, and so on. I had one really excellent judge who was generous with chits for good lines, touching moments, all that. I had one really excellent player who played toward his fates with gusto.<br/><br/>Probably the most interesting element of our Zero Act scenes was the Emotion Matrix rolls. They\u2019re a Big Deal during Zero Act because they\u2019re actually mandatory, which is interesting. They ended up being random extra Aiki, as the rolls would produce weird or difficult initial emotions and I\u2019d quickly pay out extra Aiki to move the result to a more suitable result.  I\u2019m still mulling over the three-way tension between the player\u2019s desire for authorship (pay Kiai to say \u201chell no, this is what I want to feel toward this NPC\u201d), performance (suck it up and play whatever comes up because you\u2019re just that awesome), and fishing for Aiki (because they see that I\u2019ll pay them to move the result). Thinking about how best to use that system. It seems abuseable but only in a Being A Dick kind of way.<br/><br/>Continued! --&gt;                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404519/#Comment_404519" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-25T07:58:07+00:00" title="January 25, 2013  7:58AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Then we had time for our first Intermission, between Zero Act and Act 1, and that was interesting too. I really like how personalized/customized everyone\u2019s Fates get after the Zero Act \u2013 I\u2019d have no hesitation handing out four identical whatevers (samurai, ninjas, monks, etc.) and letting them differentiate during Intermission. Everyone cranked their Fates as high as their Karma would allow. The armour rider experimented with her suit\u2019s inherent Karma, taking on some of the armour\u2019s Karma so he could raise a second of her Fates to 3. Nobody rewrote any Fates to start. Oh, and one of the players paid the armour princess a chit to take the Fate \u201cEmotion: power hungry.\u201d That was pretty cool. <br/><br/>Intermission took another 30ish minutes. So, about 2.5 hours for our first go. I can see Intermissions getting much faster! But I have no idea how long Act One scenes are going to work out to be, especially as we\u2019re learning the systems.<br/><br/>Highlight reel:<br/><br/>\u2022\tSetting up the Zero Act was unintuitive to my existing skill base, but is certainly something you can learn.<br/><br/>\u2022\tMy Zero Act scenes were probably too long but I don\u2019t see any other way to give the players enough time to gel their performances in 5 minutes.<br/><br/>\u2022\tPlayers really liked the quick-cut cinematic style to scene framing.<br/><br/>\u2022\tI am going to need to experiment with the Emotion Matrix dynamic of players spending Kiai versus GM granting Aiki. I fear at least one of my players will just milk it for Aiki by holding firm to whatever the initial emotion result is, especially given there\u2019s no real teeth to the result. It seems like the kind of thing that could go sour in a group with a culture that doesn\u2019t embrace the fun of jockeying for the right spot and/or doesn\u2019t play toward that first result in a serious way. Proceeding with caution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
