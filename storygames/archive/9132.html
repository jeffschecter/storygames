In Mouse Guard, when PCs team up to work toward some goal, only one player rolls dice; the other(s) "help", adding dice to be rolled.  In order to help, you have to say <i>how</i> you help.  <br/><br/>I heard this rule and shrugged.  I'm quite familiar with "Action B gives you a bonus, now explain/justify Action B in terms of the fiction", and as often as not, I've found it's led to uninspired narration.  Combat actions become variations on "I swing really hard", stealth actions find new (or old) ways to say, "I move slowly and carefully", and a lot of lines are delivered quickly and thoughtlessly so we can get to the die roll, dammit.<br/><br/>In this game, however, one of the other players (Jonathan) approached his "helping" narration opportunities with great creativity and gusto, at times bordering on stealing the scene from the "primary" PC.  I was initially a little disoriented by this, but by the end of the session, I was wishing I'd followed suit and milked more out of my own narration spots.<br/><br/>I'm inclined to think that this is a matter of player experience.  I have more experience doing "trad" gaming, and some recent GM-less story-gaming play.  So I know that I like authoring, but I'm not used to doing it when someone else is the GM.  However, I don't want to rule out the possibility that there's something going on in the Mouse Guard rules that's more conducive to this kind of play than, say, the rules of Rifts.

This is something I witnessed while playing the storytelling game <i>The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen</i> (from Hogshead publishing) with people ranging from kids to non-gamers to rpg players. "Trad" rpg players who didn't gamemaster consistently had the hardest times telling improvised stories. I think a lot of "trad" rpgs make it taboo to try to narrate the story (that power is reserved for the gamemaster!), and that, more than ability, holds people back.<br/><br/>Mouse Guard isn't the only mainstream rpg that has little spots where players take over narration. White Wolf's <i>Exalted</i> has bonuses for adding description. Of course, around here it seems like almost every game has players narrating, and most of us are used to playing such games, so it's easy to forget that some people aren't entirely comfortable with doing it.<br/><br/>Experiment with different degrees of narration and find the balance between narration and getting on with it that makes you most happy, then stick with that, and let everyone else in your group find their own happy balance, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201872/#Comment_201872" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-13T17:03:00+00:00" title="April 13, 2009  5:03PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I shrug because I'm bored.

That, all by itself, is just a huge help in my mind -- now *all* the mice are angry or hungry or whatever.

Mouse Guard is a fairly light system, compared with (say) Burning Empires. BE uses specific scene types where mechanics are under-emphasized to ensure colour is not left by the wayside, but Mouse Guard doesn't need these types of scenes as the relative lack of crunch invites players to narrate more.<br/><br/>In my experience with D&amp;D4E, I'm finding it difficult to ensure the colour is added in - there's just so much tactical crunch going on that dramatic swordplay and forest fires (those missed Dailys have to hit <i>something</i>, right?) seem like unnecessary distractions.<br/><br/>My best example of this comes from a playtest I did recently of my zombie-game-in-progress (everyone has one, right?). The game is scene- and card-driven and rather strategic, at least on the surface. The cards act as a sort of currency, such that players will want to hoard certain cards to complete in-game tasks and goals. However, even without playing cards, players can narrate all manner of advantages which amount to nothing but colour. I saw the introduction of colour as a self-rewarding activity - after all, colour is what RPGs amount to in the end, isn't it? - and fully expected people to engage heavily in it. After the first round of scenes, play stopped entirely, with the playtesters questioning what the <i>purpose</i> of their narration was - why didn't we just play it as a boardgame? My assumption, grounded in the feedback I received from that short session, was: if the game had had less <i>game</i> to it, less of a formal scene economy, less currency, less constant interfacing with system - people would have been more apt to seek their reward in narrating story elements, even if those elements didn't have a direct impact on game balance.<br/><br/>So I guess my point is, if you want the players to naturally emphasize narrating colour, use a system that doesn't distract them from that task with lots of crunch. Compare: three-course meals are really good, but not conducive to encourage dungeon crawling, so you're better off just putting out a bowl of pretzels. Does it sound like I'm on track there?<br/><br/>FWIW, I really dislike the widespread "try harder next time" GM hammer. I find a nice happy medium to be the GM asking "do you think that's worth a helping die?" of the player, if s/he questions it - if the player says "yes", give it to them, no questions asked.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201899/#Comment_201899" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-13T21:19:19+00:00" title="April 13, 2009  9:19PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Keep an eye out for Tenra Bansho in a few months. It does this very, Very VERY well.<br/><br/>So you build up and spend Happy Fun Points ("Kiai"). These turn into Karma. Karma raises, and will make you an evil NPC unless you reduce it.<br/><br/>You reduce it by changing or erasing your relationships, goals, etc.<br/><br/>So you can min-max (use the mechanics to your advantage) and spend a fistload of these Happy Fun Points. You can calculate just how many you can spend over the "you become evil" line, where you can change/erase relationships to push that number back down below that line.<br/><br/>For example, in the very last combat of the very last scene, my karma is at 100. The limit is 108. I have a shitload of HFP. I calculate carefully. I then spend exactly 28 HFP, which will raise my skill to max, and give me fistfuls of bonus dice. Yay. But now my karma is 128, 20 over "the line". That's OK, because I calculated in advance. I erase one relationship ("Love the Princess"), and change a goal ("Protect the nation" to "Leave the nation and find a new home"), and boom my karma lowers down to that line - 108 - again, and my character is "safe".<br/><br/>But ah! What color that move produced!  By min-maxing, I basically set in motion the story events, the "Color" (Brits: "Colour") that will change my character in the epilogue of the story. I used the mechanics to my advantage, and in doing so i produced not just good, but HOT color: I decided to "change one element and erase another" to get my karma level down, and in the process of doing so I decided exactly what that meant to my character, and the story.<br/><br/>Gotta go, working on editing of the game this very moment.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ru_Baraba_Dom" title="Ru_Baraba_Dom"><img alt="Ru_Baraba_Dom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/559/n1DT8PKZTUJ28.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ru_Baraba_Dom">Ru_Baraba_Dom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201905/#Comment_201905" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-13T22:48:23+00:00" title="April 13, 2009 10:48PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 13, 2009 10:49PM by Ru_Baraba_Dom.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Exalted has already been mentioned; it's like an entry-level college course in narrative bonus work.  It pushes players to try to hit the 3-die stunt.  I'm the gm frequently, so this is sometimes fun for me since it makes a lot of descriptive color (sometimes not; an extra experience point in that game can be gained by a three die stunt, and that used to occasionally make for narrations that were way way over the top (yes, for a solar exalted game.  Just too darn long.  I had exceptional players.))  Case in point.  Anyway.  I was sick of stunting for a while, as a result, but we talked about it and kind of developed a mutual understanding about brevity and wit, etc, and now it's cool.  Still not fond of gm-adjudicated bonuses for cool narration, though.<br/><br/>Other side of the story: I didn't enjoy stunting or narrative bonuses in conflicts again until I had the amazing realization that you don't have to make your character look cool.   You can make them look like an oaf, or lucky, or like you're getting the stuffing beat out of you.  There's no mechanical difference as long as you're making good story.  Trying to sound cool all the time was an annoying burden before I figured out the disconnect between narrated character skill and mechanical effect.

I think there's just a social stigma attached to RPGs in general and sometimes you have to winkle people out of their shells.

This discussion comes at a very nice time. I've been thinking about a co-operative narration mechanic that someone suggested at my last playtest, but couldn't really articulate the challenges in implementing such a thing. I just wrote a somewhat lengthy blog post about it <a href="http://gobi.livejournal.com/745109.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>In the next playtest, I'm going to run an experiment to see how little mechanical incentive is necessary for a cooperative narration mechanic. In Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple, there are Trouble Cards that ech describe an ongoing problem. You pick one, you resolve it, and then draw stones to see if there are negative consequences of that deed. (There's never a question of <i>if</i> you do something, just what might happen <i>after</i>.<br/><br/>Some Trouble Cards have stars drawn on them over the course of play. A star means that in order to choose this card, you need to ask another player to describe how their pilgrim helps yours solve the problem. More stars mean you need more help. You can see further details in the link.<br/><br/>Otherwise, I'm not adding any further mechanical incentive to this contribution. No dice roll to rush towards, no shared risk of injury or malady. I'm curious if that's sufficient. It'll be interesting to see.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201962/#Comment_201962" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-14T10:48:11+00:00" title="April 14, 2009 10:48AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lachek, <br/>My experience supports your "minimize crunch" suggestion.  I've played several games whose mechanics are <i>just</i> there to provide color, and succeed in this.  Right now, though, I'm wondering about something different.  There's some nice synergy in those cycles wherein color just naturally comes out of going for strategic optimization and success.  I want to understand that better.  I imagine there's some limit to "low crunch" past which the strategy component becomes too weak to motivate anyone, but perhaps that's not inherent...<br/><br/>Andy, <br/>That's a really interesting example.  If I understand it correctly, the game is mute on "how do I describe my combat actions", but grabbing combat bonuses gives you seeds for story to follow.  This later story then has all sorts of neat springboards (changed relationship, and perhaps the combat victory as well?) to inspire colorful narration.  Is that right?  So the formula is not "min-max -&gt; color" but rather "min-max -&gt; situation" and then presumably "situation -&gt; color", right?  <br/><br/>I ask because I've had varying levels of success with "ooh, cool situation with change and drama and relationships!" actually churning out quality color in play.  The best experiences I've had have included a high degree of context and prior investment and interaction in play with whatever the situation's about.  Like, y'know, if no one cared that you loved the princess, no one cares if that changes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_202029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis" title="Grant Davis"><img alt="Grant Davis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis">Grant Davis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202029/#Comment_202029" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-14T15:20:15+00:00" title="April 14, 2009  3:20PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This reminds me of Torg. There were a couple of places where you had to come up with some fiction to justify the mechanics: "approved actions" and card trading. People tended to put some effort into approved actions but were notoriously bad about justifying card trading, until it got to the point where one didn't even try. Perhaps it didn't matter as much because card trading was fun in and of itself.<br/><br/>-Grant                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202036/#Comment_202036" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-14T16:21:25+00:00" title="April 14, 2009  4:21PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 14, 2009 8:51PM by John_Harper.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can vouch for Tenra Bansho.

If you're not trying to do that all the time, without a reward... something has gone wrong along the way. In Mouse Guard, you don't <i>justify</i> the helping die. Giving the helping die is an <i>opportunity</i> for you to say cool things, in the spotlight.

When the goal of the player using the mechanic is to produce good colour.<br/><br/>How do you make a mechanic which provides an advantage produce a good colour? Much harder to answer, but I think that what Andy and some people propose are ways for you to produce good colour not in-spite of what the player does, but regardless. Mechanics which produce "good colour".<br/><br/>The thing is, "Good colour" only matters when the players care for it. If a player <i>only</i> cares for the min-maxing, then the colour produced is good, but it's aimed at the other players, because they couldn't care less. If the whole group doesn't care for the colour produced, you get "I attack with my sword". If you care about producing good colour, you will produce it anyway, and the mechanics should provide you both incentives and rewards, and of course, things you wouldn't have thought of otherwise... (randomness, the TBZ or 9W's Muses: Where you <i>need</i> it, so it brings forth change that you may not have brought otherwise).<br/><br/>But in the end? Players produce good colour. Good colour only matters as far as players care for it. The "colour" the mechanics provide may be deemed "Good" to people who hear of it later, like what Andy describes, but if the players in the game don't think highly of it, it doesn't mean squat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202043/#Comment_202043" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-14T17:23:06+00:00" title="April 14, 2009  5:23PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thing I hate is when the rules <i>get in the way</i> of Saying Cool Stuff. The most obvious situation for this is the repeated action: <br/><br/>I'm playing 3E D&amp;D, first level fighter. I want to participate in combat, which (depending on the GM and the grou) basically boils down to attacking every round and trying to make sure I'm in a spot where I can take AoOs on enemies. I try real hard to describe the cool stuff I do, Saying Cool Things when I can. Problem is, with maybe a few dozen swings per combat I quickly get tired of thinking of new, cool ways to say "I attack the orc."<br/><br/>There's a couple of ways I've seen games get around this, either by using a broader scale (now I get to describe how I beat the orc after my roll, not how I attack him) or by giving more options (see 4E D&amp;D). Sometimes while reading a game it's hard to tell how well it does, the first time I read My Life With Master I thought I'd get tired of the mechanics after about two rolls, but the way rolls are called for means I'm often describing something cool, not just "I attack again."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
