It is not used constructively; it is used to identify an unwanted behavior.  As yet, nobody has really got behind the technique to advocate for its actual utility, if any (although Ralph seems to be sliding towards that as a devil's advocate).  A lot of 'storyboarding' discussions remind me of the old Beeg Horseshoe discussions where folks argued whether or not Simulationism actually existed.  It's an incredibly one-sided discussion of questionable value.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, players complain about storyboarding when their fellow players scene-frame past the stuff that they wanted to play through.  In other words, when there is an unspoken disagreement about which parts of the fiction are significant and which parts can safely be glossed over.  It can and should be remedied by saying, "Can we stop?  I'd like to play this part out."  Turn the unspoken disagreement into a spoken discussion.

I'll go ahead and quote myself here:\n<blockquote>My definition involves a shift in the way IIEE and the general procedural nature of play works. This is going to take some explaining:<br/><br/>I believe that improvisation and "composition" (aka "normal" authorship) represents two distinct modes of the creation. As such, each mode presents its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Traditional RPG play is inherently improvisational. In fact, it seems structured to maximize the strengths and minimize the weaknesses of improvisation.<br/><br/>Now, I would argue that the <i>immediacy</i> of the fiction that we experience when role-playing---stuff like the heightened sense of character identification---is largely a byproduct of improvisational play. This is where my understanding of "story-boarding" comes from.<br/><br/>Normal play is built "sequentially" or "procedurally", one event on top of the last. I would call story-boarding those times when players step off to the side and develop multiple events all in unison, and then pop them back into the sequence. In other words, they hit the "improvisational pause" button, and begin engaging in "compositional" play.<br/><br/>In the big picture, this is a perfectly fine technique, but there is a trade-off that players must be aware of. The players gain the advantages of "composition", but they lose the advantages of improvisation. And since the "immediacy" of the fiction is one of those things gained by improvisation, it's one of the things players lose by switching modes.<br/><br/>And that seems to explain what people are complaining about with "story-boarding". </blockquote>\nAnd furthermore:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: timfire</cite><cite>Posted By: blankshield</cite>Is "outlining the entire scene, including it's likely endpoint, before playing it" a fair approximation of what you're calling storyboarding?</blockquote>\nMy own understanding isn't quite that simple.<br/><br/>Let's say you have a game, like... heck, <i>The Mountain Witch</i>, that broadly outlines the goals of various scenes or acts. But in games like that, the ending of the scenes/acts isn't what's important for play, it's all the interactions and such in the middle that's important.<br/><br/>Compare that to my earlier <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=233475" rel="nofollow">PTA</a> or <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=233458" rel="nofollow"><i>Polaris</i></a> examples. In those made-up situations, the players are actually outlining the stuff that's intended to be important.<br/><br/>Do you see that distinction I'm trying to make? I wouldn't call the former story-boarding, but I would the latter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233955/#Comment_233955" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-23T15:17:46+00:00" title="September 23, 2009  3:17PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 23, 2009 3:20PM by komradebob.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: timfire</cite><br/><cite>Posted By: Dan Maruschak</cite>One of the oft-cited examples seems to be people inadvertently over-framing PTA scenes and screwing themselves out of their own fun, so I don't think the entire phenomenon can be reduced to one of playstyle differences or miscommunication.</blockquote>\nYep, something else is going on.<br/><br/><br/>Is it the failure of anyone involved to step up and introduce conflict?<br/><br/>I mean, at some level, doesn't there need to be a player who is going to act as troublemaker in order to keep things going?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233959/#Comment_233959" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-23T16:25:00+00:00" title="September 23, 2009  4:25PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that's right.

Jeremiah and Naomi at the docks."<br/>"Yeah, cool. Maybe Naomi is hiding behind some crates by the cargo ship."<br/>"Yeah, and the guards are patrolling, flashlights, guns, all that."<br/>"And Jeremiah can be on a rooftop with his rifle, covering her.

So on the one hand you know where the scene is heading...just like a cinema storyboard shows where the scene is heading.  But its still totally fun to play it out and see how it developed and what kind of advantage / disadvantage you carry into the anticipated scene in the boat.<br/><br/>But John's snippet took it a step farther and added:<br/><br/>"...and when she gets on board she gets ambushed in the engine room by Kate. 'So good to see you again, sister,' heh heh heh.""<br/><br/>Since the follow up comment in the example was "awesome" this is what twigs me to the idea that what is cool in this scene for these players is this confrontation...the sneaking and the sniping is just background to be passed through without slowing to play it out.<br/><br/>So its all a question of what feels right, and like Josh says...communicating.  If I'd wanted to play out the sniping and the sneaking I might speak up and say "hold on, lets not get ahead of ourselves, lets see what happens on the docks first...is Jeremiah really a good enough shot to keep those guards off of Naomi while she makes her way to the boat?"  In an established group, you can develop a feel for this and not actually need to say it in words.

I swear, our group gets more of a charge out of petty in-character bickering, teasing, and chitchat than we do out of just about anything else -- I'd say it's at least half of what brings us to the table each week.  The tension, stakes, and/or conflict that go along with "cutting to the chase" tends to stomp on that fun in a way that "pointless" scenes don't.<br/><br/>And storyboarding (or overly-aggressive scene-framing, or whatever the high council of jargon judges eventually decide to call it) can be a real buzzkill for us for the same reason; when we decide to pass over an "unimportant" thing, whether explicitly or accidentally, we're giving up an opportunity for a particular kind of play that we love.

In the example above, for me, the chase isn't the point. The point is a series of exciting action-adventure scenes, and knowing that a chase is coming up in two scenes allows me to change the direction that I take the sneak scene in. I'm not exploring "what happens next?", and instead I'm exploring "how does this go down, and what details are in it?"<br/><br/>Talking in terms of sockets, I care very little for choice and plot (and very much for aesthetic and character), so "solving" those choices and plots ahead of time allows me to allocate more mid-scene energy to what I actually care about - the how, the why, and the details.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233977/#Comment_233977" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-23T17:55:08+00:00" title="September 23, 2009  5:55PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That makes sense to me, Joe.

There is frequently more value to playing out a scene than just determining a plot branch. There is the experience of feeling the scene happen. However, if people believe that they aren't going to learn anything new from a scene they aren't motivated to actually play it out, because it instinctively looks like it will be wasted effort. Since the scene isn't actually played out it feels to some people like there's a gap in the story, since they didn't experience it in-the-moment, and they stop finding the story engaging. It would be like an author leaving out the text of a few chapters and just giving the outline of what happens. The audience can't engage with an outline.<br/><br/>I think the problem stems from "do two players disagree about the plot?" being a poor proxy for the question "is seeing this scene important to the story?".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233982/#Comment_233982" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-23T18:13:02+00:00" title="September 23, 2009  6:13PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seems like there's at least three different things being discussed here:<br/><br/>1.

Framing scenes strongly, to cut right to the important / interesting bits, which we can all agree is great when done well; and<br/><br/>3. Framing scenes way more thoroughly than you normally might, which isn't necessarily bad but is something lots of folks have historically been skeptical of (I used to call this <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=9464.0" rel="nofollow">through-framing</a>; WARNING: Link is to back when I was younger / stupider / more pretentious).<br/><br/>And because individual tastes and specific situations differ, it's not obvious what is and isn't an obtrusive amount of scene framing unless you have more of the context or are actually participating in play.

I know I can sometimes get in the mood of wanting to go easy on my character 'cause I feel sorry for her or want her to be awesome, but I rely on the system and/or the other players to make her suffer anyway. I'm pretty sure a player can dodge this easier (and can do it subconsciously) when there's a lot of storyboarding. This does not necessarily happen, of course.<br/><br/>Two: A player who takes some time thinking about stuff or is a bit timid doesn't get to influence what happens because things are going fast and people are talking excitedly. Like, I might get some great ideas when playing down in the mud, because I have some time to feel the situation and think about things, but when storyboarding things just fly past and my awesome idea doesn't get voiced. This does not necessarily happen, of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>What is "Story-Boarding"? - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10534/what-is-story-boarding/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content='What is "Story-Boarding"? - Page 2' itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10534/what-is-story-boarding/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="I like storyboarding techniques because it's easier to get my character into trouble.

If we see a character only under duress, we don't really know what it means. How does the character deal with the duress afterwards? How is the character different when kicking it back?<br/><br/>B. failing to allow meaningful immediate in-character play. It's cool to have shared narrative powers, but if that leads not being able to act freely in-character something is being missed out.<br/><br/>I don't think these are failures of storyboarding, or issues of bad scene framing. I think these are sins on their own -- which both bad scene framing and bad storyboarding can result in.<br/><br/>To me they seem like the results of focusing too much on the author/director stance and narrative powers to the detriment of playing in-character -- be that in-character play immersionist or not. I believe classic bad railroading stems from similar overfocus: classic GM advice focuses far too much on GM's powers and responsibility to make the game (story) happen, and not enough on the role of the game as a vehicle for in-character play -- the core activity from which the story emerges.<br/><br/>(I don't know where I'm going with this, though.

The<i>only</i>storyboarding "technique" I know of is outlining or otherwise "pre-narrating" events. Can you give some different examples of things you consider storyboarding?<br/>When writing fiction, it is still possible to learn new things when authoring a scene even if you have already outlined the plot -- you just can't learn things about the plot, only character information. By analogy, I think it should be possible to have satisfying roleplaying even if you know the plot events, as long as there is room to explore character in an interesting way. With single-die-roll conflict-resolution based games, there is little game-mechanical incentive to experience these known-plot scenes because the mechanics of conflict resolution focus primarily on plot. That's why I'm interested in hearing about the experiences of people who actually play out the pre-outlined scenes, like Ralph said he did in a number of the threads, to see if there are interesting game design or play techniques that can make that fun and satisfying. From my fiction writing experience, I find expanding an outline to full text is still fresh and exciting, but revising and expanding a thinly written scene is a chore, so I suspect that there will always be a danger of overly-detailed outlining. But I'd like to hear more from people who say they like storyboarding.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234055/#Comment_234055" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-24T08:46:16+00:00" title="September 24, 2009  8:46AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dan Maruschak</cite>How are you disagreeing with me?

I went over to the Forge and did a search for "storyboard*". The term gets occasional use in relation to film-storyboarding and a really old game called <i>Storyboard</i>. But the term as we're using it now seems to have emerged from Forge Midwest '08. I wasn't there, so I can't say how it first started getting used. But at the Forge, the term is almost exclusively used by Ron Edwards:\n<blockquote><cite>Ron Edwards, <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26111.msg251101#msg251101" rel="nofollow">Re: [Blazing Rose] Forge Midwest: Pacing and "Pieces"</a> (May 02, 2008)</cite>That leads to my main criticism at this point: that competing for story control is very often not fun. (Capes fans: yes, yes, fine. Whatever.) What actually constitutes the <i>point</i> for Blazing Rose is a little obscure, and in our case, I think we fell back on the idea that we are there simply to manage to put together a reasonable story using the structure built into the rules. This is perilously like <b>storyboarding</b>, or worse, like <b>storyboarding</b>-by-numbers. As a novelty, it feels fun and awesome and wow, but ultimately, once one gets past that door, it's not hard. A person finds himself wondering, "Hey, why did we make it so hard when we played all those other games," and moves on. After that point, a game which <i>merely</i> generates story structure is not sufficient.</blockquote>\n__________\n<blockquote><cite>Ron Edwards, <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26083.msg251241#msg251241" rel="nofollow">Re: [Forge Midwest] Trollbabe- Player Choices, and a Question for Ron </a> (May 06, 2008)</cite>Trollbabe is not a "group <b>storyboarding</b>" game; it is played from very deeply from within the imagining-process.</blockquote>\n__________\n<blockquote><cite>Ron Edwards, <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26180.msg251349#msg251349" rel="nofollow">Re: [unWritten] Rats</a> (May 09, 2008)</cite>My question is perhaps a little bit abstract: to what extent is your game design about <b>storyboarding</b>, and to what extent can actions taken within a scene carry some element of surprise or genuine, in-the-moment development of what's going on?<br/><br/>The reason I ask is that a great deal of a given scene seems to be established prior to playing it.

What you did smells a tiny bit different (I get this sense of "storyboarding"-as-derogatory is a slip, a mistake of not thinking clearly about what you're doing; even though it seems weird to use a legit movie/play/comic/anime device as a Bad Thing in RPGs, but that's another aside), but let me ask a question to clarify. Re flashback:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite><br/>Storyboarding was useful there because we knew how things really turn out (no one dies, these two end up trusting each other to some degree, and Mary leaves her farm to come to the city) but not the specific details. Daniel and Susan worked out a lot of stuff in director stance via metagame talk, then role-played out bits and pieces inside that framework to "color it in." It worked because it was an event from the past and finding out what happened wasn't the issue; the issue was finding out HOW it happened.</blockquote>\nCan you kinda fill out how it happened? Specifcially, did Daniel and Susan basically do the scene out from Beginning to End, and THEN go back to fill in details through roleplay? Or did they describe the scene out, and stop midway (once they felt it was the right time due to the content of what was framed) to roleplay out a bit, then close and move forward in the scene until they hit another opportunity to roleplay?<br/><br/>The former seems to be an interesting RP technique that introduces a reflective (not accidental) kind of framing *over* a scene, but digging in at bits to get the highlights. Sounds like a cool technique, and not accidental.<br/>The latter seems to be another interesting RP technique of limited use (ie not All The Time) which can help players recognize that a scene isn't important enough to play through the whole thing, but just of just enough interest to punctuate a gloss-over with bits of RP. Sounds like a cool technique, and probably not accidental.<br/><br/>EDIT: In the end, seems like my hangup is this idea between "accidental storyboarding", and "planned out storyboarding". Ron in his quotes seems to cover both (primarily the former, then brings it up later like it's a choice in gaming, a choice he doesn't like), while Adam seems to imply that the latter could be a cool RP tool in the toolbox. If the latter is the thing, I might instead call the accidental form of storyboarding "runaway scene framing" or something more helpful.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234083/#Comment_234083" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-24T11:20:10+00:00" title="September 24, 2009 11:20AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, you're right.

IMO, it's very significant *what exactly* is being outlined, and towards what end.<br/><br/>In most examples of "outlining" that I'm aware of---which might include <i>The Mountain Witch</i>---the outline is used to simply set up a situation for play. If I say, "in this scene the two lovers meet, and it should end with some sort of hint that they are falling in love," that's not saying what's going to happen in the scene. In other words, in that sort of play the end of the scene isn't important, it's all the interactions in the middle that's important. The players are still creating the actual story, they're just following a preset dramatic arch.<br/><br/>This is like a chord progression in a jazz song. The structure ensures there's some sort of musical movement, but it doesn't outline what the actual melody/harmony/etc is going to be.<br/><br/>I believe the storyboarding issue is different. In those cases, the players are actually outlining the dramatic events that are meant to be important. So when they sit down to play the scene or whatever, they're no longer actually creating a story, they're just coloring or detailing the (psuedo-) script.<br/><br/>Do you follow that distinction I'm trying to make? It's a very subjective standard---which is hard to discuss online since we lack the greater context of play---but I believe that's the thing that distinguishes between "fun" and "unfun".<br/><br/>Adam, if you're following what I'm saying, would you still call your experience "storyboarding" or just "outlining"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234096/#Comment_234096" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-24T12:11:12+00:00" title="September 24, 2009 12:11PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Did the two so their scene framing, glossing over some RP-ish moments, then go into it with regular roleplay (as you stated above) *AND THEN* do more framing (framing the scene forward a bit) and THEN AGAIN "stop" and do more in-character roleplaying, and so on, through the flashback?</blockquote>\nNo, they did a bunch of meta discussion, then role-played, then ended.

Why do we care about the sneak if it's just an excuse to get to the trap, which is in turn an excuse to get to the chase?<br/><br/>I guess what I'm saying is, cut to the chase.</blockquote>\nSage, cool.<br/><br/>Personally, I'm interested in playing within a guided structure. In the example above, for me, the chase isn't the point. The point is a series of exciting action-adventure scenes, and knowing that a chase is coming up in two scenes allows me to change the direction that I take the sneak scene in. I'm not exploring "what happens next?", and instead I'm exploring "how does this go down, and what details are in it?"<br/><br/>Talking in terms of sockets, I care very little for choice and plot (and very much for aesthetic and character), so "solving" those choices and plots ahead of time allows me to allocate more mid-scene energy to what I actually care about - the how, the why, and the details.<br/><br/>I completely agree that the moment-to-moment stuff is where it's at. For me I just lose some interest in the moment to moment if there's not an open question somewhere in it. I like to explore both what and how, which is certainly a matter of personal taste.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10534/what-is-story-boarding" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10534/what-is-story-boarding" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10534/what-is-story-boarding/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F10534%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F10534%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
