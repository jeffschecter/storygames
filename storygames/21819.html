There's no separate battle mode. There's no roll for initiative. There are no sub-games. The flow of play is the same, for a tense conversation or a chase or a fight or an extended training montage or a sex scene or what-you-have. In fact, all of those - and more - can happen in parallel. Think like a movie fight scene, not like an RPG fight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477052/#Comment_477052" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-10-14T06:17:16+00:00" title="October 14, 2018  6:17AM">October 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Related to both points above:<br/><br/>When things feel unclear, uncertain, you're not sure what to say or what move to use... always "zoom in" more. <br/><br/>Ask clarifying questions, establish fictional details, talk about where characters are, how they're standing and what it smells like, how they're holding that gun or what expression they have on their face, what they're feeling or thinking, what they want, what this reminds them of, what they think of each other.<br/><br/>In the process you'll almost always figure out the right thing to do mechanically (including what MC move to make), and the game will be richer for it.<br/><br/>Don't let the last-minute panic of "Oh, man, what do we do here? Is it that move or this one? What kind of MC move should I make now?" ever take over; always come back to establishing more fictional detail and play feels easy and fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mabgriff" title="mabgriff"><img alt="mabgriff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mabgriff">mabgriff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477070/#Comment_477070" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-10-14T22:47:24+00:00" title="October 14, 2018 10:47PM">October 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the tips, everyone. The first session went pretty well. We got a little mired in worldbuilding, but we were able to move along ultimately and "leave blank spaces." I definitely had several moments of uncertainty which, in another system, might have led to panic. Being able to step back and ask questions was quite a relief.<br/><br/>I'm still struggling against the instinct to call for discern realities as if it were a perception roll, but I'm sure that will abate with time. I think my main area for improvement is keeping things tense when the PCs are rolling exceptionally well, as they were last night.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477074/#Comment_477074" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-10-15T03:14:09+00:00" title="October 15, 2018  3:14AM">October 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Any favorite moments or highlights that come to mind?<br/><br/>Favorite player decisions?

I'd sent an NPC I expected to be important to meet the group in the middle of the night. The player on watch, completely in character, decided this person was a distraction, turned her away, and burned the note she left behind. Now I know to build that party of the story as a front, rather than the primary plot.<br/><br/>I'm hoping the prep between sessions will help me be more harsh with gm moves. My instincts are relatively gentle, so having things in advance this time will be good.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
