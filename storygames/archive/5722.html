I want to talk about what makes the system rock, what needs to stay the same, and what could use some tweakin'.<br/><br/><b>System: Simple, quick</b><br/><br/>First of all, the system is really simple. You roll two dice, and toggle the score by 1 for each line on your character sheet that you can bring in (you have 1 Concept and 3 Support Traits). You're trying to roll above 7. If you succeed at doing so, your stakes are realized.<br/><br/>Now, that gets complicated by contested stuff a little bit. If my character and your character go toe to toe, we're each rolling against that target number separately, and then if we both succeed at beating our target number, we compare margins of success to determine who actually wins the roll (more on this later).<br/><br/>Your margin of failure (for uncontested rolls, the amount below 7; for contested rolls, the amount below your opponent's total) comes back to bite you in the ass in the form of Consequences. If I lose by 3, I take 3 points of Consequences. Maybe I take: Hobbled Knee 1, Senile Dementia 2.<br/><br/><b>Characters: Refined, to the point, fun</b><br/><br/>So, you start with a Concept. This is a simple adjective/noun combination. Rebel Cyborg. Simple Housewife. Insecure Wrestler.<br/><br/><i>The scenario I played in was a 70's bush party called The Kegger. I played Becky Holiday. Her Concept was Horny Slut.</i><br/><br/>And then, you come up with three Support Features to flesh out the character and add to the concept. These are free-form traits, and you can do anything with them.<br/><br/><i>Becky Holiday took: Catholic Upbringing; Gossip-y Little Snake; "But I'm not wearing any..."</i><br/><br/>You come up with three pieces of gear, which you can burn to allow re-rolls and help negate Consequences.<br/><br/><i>Becky Holiday took: Short Skirt and a Long Jacket; Someone Else's Car; Someone Else's Lighter</i><br/><br/>And finally, you can take a Challenge. A Challenge is something that constantly trips your character up. Mechanically, the GM can compel it (a la SOTC) to give you re-rolls.<br/><br/><i>Becky Holiday took: But I love the foreign kid, Do.</i><br/><br/>The character creation process is really simple, and it's just focused enough to give you a good jumping off point. Who are you? What does that look like in practice? What kind of stuff do you carry with you? What troubles you?<br/><br/><i>Becky Holiday<br/>Concept: Horny Slut<br/>Support Features: Catholic Upbringing; Gossip-y Little Snake; "But I'm not wearing any..."<br/>Gear: Short Skirt and a Long Jacket; Someone Else's Car; Someone Else's Lighter<br/>Challenge: But I love the foreign kid, Do.</i><br/><br/><b>What I love about the game</b><br/><br/>I love all of character creation.<br/>I like the idea that gear is just a prop until you burn it.<br/>I like the name well enough. It's simple, it's easy to remember, and its origin story is cute.<br/>It's a solid con game.<br/><br/><b>What I think needs to change/stay the same</b><br/><br/>Someone mentioned that they were thinking of re-naming it The Trait System. I dislike that suggestion. Changing name: fine. Trait System: highly dislike.<br/><br/>I think that it's weird to have a target number as well as comparing success against the opponent. It feels a touch glitchy to me. Can you have contested rolls be simple character-vs-character, with no target number?<br/><br/>There is some discussion about what Support Features should be called. I like Support Features. They are Features that Support the Concept.<br/><br/>I think that Consequences are brutal and pile up really quickly. Maybe whenever you lose a new conflict, Consequences replace old consequences, rather than piling up? So if I have 4 Consequences and I lose a new contest by 3, then my old Consequences all go away and I create 3 points of new Consequences?<br/><br/>...another suggestion made by someone during the game was that instead of creating X different Consequences, create one that lasts X scenes/contests/etc.<br/><br/>I think that every character should always have to take a Challenge.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127886/#Comment_127886" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T00:50:49+00:00" title="February 20, 2008 12:50AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 20, 2008 12:58AM by johnzo.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ditto Joe on the weirdness of the target number in opposed checks, and also on the goodness of 2D character creation.<br/><br/>Playing Beast Hunters the next morning really brought the latter home for me.  In BH, you need to generate 18 (? -- I don't have my book in front of me) traits and then slot them all into a 3x4 matrix.  I've seen a lot of coolness fatigue at BH character creation sessions.  And Over The Edge has always felt too coarse for me, with only four traits to define a character.  2D characters have eight, which I think is my Goldilox number for freeform traits.<br/><br/>In line with that thinking, I'd reduce the number of Consequences that can be tagged on a single character at a time.  During the game, I didn't understand that a character could take multiple levels in a single Consequence.  So when Mitch took four of them in a single shot, I was kinda stumped while trying to think of the third and fourth ones.   This was the least appealing bit of the game to me, having to think up scads of consequences on the fly.   Too many of them can dilute a character.<br/><br/>That said...<br/><br/><b>I think that Consequences are brutal and pile up really quickly</b><br/><br/>I actually thought this was a feature for a con game.  It made for a short, sharp session that nonetheless felt complete.  IIRC, you're guaranteed two conflicts in a session -- the maximum Cs you could pull on a single die roll were 5, and it took six to endgame out.  <br/><br/>Or maybe two guaranteed conflicts is one too few.  Maybe for a smaller game you'd want to increase that number.<br/><br/>Perhaps the Consequence cost of the conflict could be negotiated up front as part of stakes-setting, with riskier actions drawing more Consequences?  It was a bit weird to negotiate stakes up front and roll for Consequences on the back end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127889/#Comment_127889" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T01:01:15+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  1:01AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Riding off what Johnzo said about Consequences... you could set a Consequence Limit as part of stakes. Like, if we say "2 Consequence limit", that means that when you roll for them, 1 means 1 Consequence, 2 means 2 Consequences, and 3-6 means no Consequences.<br/><br/>You could also include a chapter mechanic, where in the first chapter of the game the max Consequence Limit is 3, and in the second chapter of the game the minimum Consequence Limit is 3.
