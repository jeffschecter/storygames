I used the idea of Aspects from FATE/FU as a skill system, and tied the mechanic of Anima Surges to emotional strengths of the characters.<br/><br/>All PC's get a central concept Aspect that describes their character in one phrase. This is intended to be a broad aspect that can be used in many situations. However, it does NOT give you a bonus draw unless you spend a Drama Point.<br/><br/>PC's then get five more Aspects:<br/><br/>Attribute - What innate advantage do you have? Are you especially strong, smart, or quick?<br/>Skill - What skill are you especially good at? <br/>Connection - How are you connected to the world? Do you have a relationship with someone else? Someone in the party? Are you a member of a group? What do you owe your allegiance to?<br/>Edge - What is your unique advantage? Were you trained by someone special, or do you have some kind of special power of privilege? Do you have a piece of equipment that is special to you?<br/>Flaw - What's working against you? Do you have a weakness, hang-up, nemesis, or vulnerability?<br/><br/>The PCs then get three Drives, representing emotional strength that support them. Each drive is connected to one of the seven elements in Mystic Empyrean.<br/><br/>Motivation - What do you want?  What's so important it's worth risking your life for? How will you get it?<br/><br/>Fire - You want to conquer your enemies in battle, or you are chasing someone for revenge.<br/>Light - You are seeking knowledge or enlightenment.<br/>Electricity - You're looking for inspiration, or perhaps just wanderlust, a desire to see other worlds.<br/>Water - You're trying to help someone else, either someone specific or anyone in trouble you meet.<br/>Stone - You are obeying a command from a superior, or you have been driven from your home and are trying to get back.<br/>Darkness - You seek personal gain.<br/>Air - You want to be famous.<br/><br/><br/>Virtue - What's your greatest emotional asset? What can you not back down from when its presented to you?<br/><br/>Fire - You're headstrong and competitive, and love challenges.<br/>Light - You have a strong code of personal honor, and you rely on intuition.<br/>Electricity - You have a flair for the dramatic and artistic. You love to create.<br/>Water - You can adapt to different situations easily. You rely on compassion to make friends and calm enemies. <br/>Stone - You are selfless and hard-working, with a strong sense of duty.<br/>Darkness - You are cunning, and prefer to use stealth and trickery to get what you want.<br/>Air - You are natural leader. You are at your best when inspiring others.<br/><br/><br/>Vice - What holds you back? What base urges do you have to compete against? Note that the elements associated with vices do not mean that the character lacks that element, but rather they have an imbalance in it or too much to control.<br/><br/>Fire - You've got a quick temper or you're bloodthirsty. You want to destroy things that anger you.<br/>Light - You are vain and prideful, or you may be overly critical or controlling of others. <br/>Electricity - You have a sense of entitlement, and always demand the best. When people slight you, you hold a grudge.<br/>Water - You are insecure, and try to hard to emulate other people or curry their favors. <br/>Stone - You are lazy, pessimistic, or lacking in compassion towards other people.<br/>Darkness - You enjoy making people suffer, especially after you've taken them down. <br/>Air - You are greedy and manipulative.<br/><br/><br/>To make an action, determine what type of element is being used. Then draw from the Balance. Each Aspect that helps you or other factors working to your advantage lets you draw an extra card if desired. Each disadvantage or Flaw reduces the draw. If there are net disadvantages, draw one extra card for each and take the worst result. Aether always stops the draw, and gives the worst possible result.<br/><br/>Drives can be used to replace the element drawn with the element of that drive, if you can explain how you use it, similar to an Anima Surge. Once used, that drive cannot be used again until it is recharged by acting on that drive. You must indulge your vice, make progress towards your goal, or act on your virtue to recharge.<br/><br/>Drama Points can be spent to:<br/><br/>- Activate your central Aspect for one action, allowing it to give you a bonus draw like your other Aspects.<br/>- Introduce a new plot element.<br/>- Ask for a hint.<br/>- Recharge a Drive.<br/><br/>Drama Points are earned by:<br/><br/>- Dramatic heroism.<br/>- Things getting complicated.<br/>- Being affected by a Flaw.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
