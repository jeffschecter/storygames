For some reason, I LOATHED the game. And sure, I had my reasons, but on the other hand, I really dug the White Wolf games, and god knows I think those games have terribly designed rules at times.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so, events conspired to get me a copy of the Pathfinder core book for free, and I let myself say: Ok, I\u2019ve been an asshole here, it\u2019s not that bad. And I\u2019m trying to put together a short game where I am, and it\u2019ll be vastly easier to get folks to play Pathfinder than Apocalypse World like I wanted to (sigh), and so, I figured, what the hell, I\u2019ll give it a shot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019ve been partially inspired by some of the commentary in the 3.5 Story Game hacks thread, I\u2019ve decided to do a little work of my own, trying to hammer down some of the issues I have with the system as it stands, and try to make it more dramatic in play, without wholesale rewriting the game from the ground up.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time though, I\u2019m curious as to what resources there are out there for bog-standard Pathfinder, what pitfalls folks run into when running the system. Ways to make playing the game easier, clever ways of looking at bits of it, houserules you always use because it just makes the game that much better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this isn\u2019t really the sort of game that gets trotted out around her much, but I think the folks here might have interesting perspectives that might not necessarily get expressed other places.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo thanks for any stuff you help me with in advance!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332180/#Comment_332180" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-28T21:53:56+00:00" title="June 28, 2011  9:53PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Captain Thark</cite>In a perfect world (Olympia Washington) I'd have people beating down my door to play AW.</blockquote>\nYou're in Olympia, home of Fabricated Realities (did we meet there, btw?), and there's no AW game you can get in on?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332220/#Comment_332220" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T07:15:03+00:00" title="June 29, 2011  7:15AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For Hacks, I recommend:<br><br>1.

That is, early on casters are balanced because of their fragility, but by the time you're hitting 9th-10th level you will find the non-casters are starting to feel superfluous when in the normal dungeoneering setup, and at 15th level or so they are just a drag on the casters and should stay home.  There are many ways to handle this, but most of the techniques are well-known to Story Hyphen Games Dot Com participants, like making plotlines and decisions be about each of the characters in their turn, or focusing on the  goals of the characters as the driving force in what happens in the world.  Another way is to suck and have players that kinda suck and don't identify game-killing combos.  That one works for me a LOT, my complete lack of tactical know how and system mastery has kept D&amp;D3 et. seq. fresh and exciting while much smarter people have mired themselves in drudgery by Solving D&amp;D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332344/#Comment_332344" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T17:25:44+00:00" title="June 29, 2011  5:25PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm still a big fan of Ryan S's ("Ry" on Story Games) hack called "E6".

Pathfinder is what got me to play again, I've run a couple of short games since and played in a few and it was all reasonably fun. Here are some of my opinions and "best practices" I've picked up in ten years of running 3.x, if they're worth anything to anyone. <br/><br/>E6 is pretty cool and absolutely correct in one thing: that after lvl 6 it becomes a different game. Still, I somehow feel that cutting leveling beyond that is somewhat unfair to the game: you're leaving 14 levels of play out! I think 4E acknowledged the whole thing by introducing tiers, because yeah, once you're level 7 you're dealing with a whole different set of issues and dangers than at level  1 (and then again at 15). If you're not going with E6 my suggestion would be to embrace it and consciously deal with it on a campaign/setting level. Tier 1 is Indiana Jones, Tier 2 is Justice League, Tier 3 is pseudo-Exalted. If you get them to level 6-7, <i>be prepared to shift gears</i>, trudging through a dark dungeon might still be challenging for a lower level party but then you need new tricks. This has a lot to do with casters, as JD points out above, but it's also about magic items and treasure. If they get a flying carpet, don't despair about your earthbound orcs, but introduce pterodactyl-riding gith or whatever a couple sessions later. It becomes a different game, which is why I completely understand the impulse behind E6, trying to keep the game consistent with itself.<br/><br/>If you're worried about casters (and rightfully so), make them work a little harder for their spells. Like, have them quest for components or scrolls, so they actually earn the spell (and not just have them like that), and you can keep a somewhat tighter hand on what the wizard can do. For clerics, when they pray to their god for spells and miracles, the god gets to ask shit of them. But this can become a pain in the ass fast.<br/><br/>In my experience hacking D&amp;D would often have to go the whole way. There's just so many inbuilt assumptions and semi-invisible synergies between all the various bits of the whole mess that it's hard to disentangle them. And it is a mess! My suggestion would be to optimize, optimize, optimize. Optimize play time, your prep, your monsters. I don't mean it in a powergamer sense, but rather about cutting down to essentials and focusing on what matters.<br/><br/>Learn the combat system, and embrace it, really learn how combat works and don't worry whether it's "realistic" or not, play it like some complicated chess game, with all the 5ft. steps and stuff. Use initiative trackers (half-folded index cards with PC and monster names on each side on top of your GM screen) and make sure everyone is ready to go, inform them that their turn is coming up. (The alternative, as JD notes, is to suck and completely ignore the system mastery aspect, but then everyone at the table must be like that, just one "powergamer" can ruin your evening. But playing D&amp;D as ignorant is fun! I would humbly suggest an earlier edition for that kind of play however.)<br/><br/>I've tried cutting initiative from the system (and it works, just have everyone announce their actions, throw their dice and go on their action roll, highest to lowest; or treat it as AW/DW "goes") but I think it screws with certain aspects of the combat, it's not broken, just changes  the dynamics. There's definitely less waiting for everyone and things move a bit faster. In general you want your combats to run quickly (and at lower levels they will, but things start dragging as you advance in tiers).<br/><br/>Pathfinder has made maneuvers easier to use, so use them, even if they're sometimes suboptimal. Inspire your players to use them, too, leading by example. Steal a page from 4E monsters, making them more thematic. Don't be afraid to pin a few feats on a monster to make it more interesting, even if it's not strictly by the monster-building rules (more like guidelines really). Make your lizardmen bullies by optimizing them for Bull Rushing, make your kobolds shifty by optimizing them for movement and trickery etc. When you prep for an encounter boil your monsters down to what they will actually use in the encounter. Combine these with interesting, dynamic terrain and environmental effects (not all the time, don't overdo it) - also make sure the terrain features, whatever they are are "neutral", that is, they change the dynamic, but aren't there just to hinder or challenge the players.<br/><br/>If it's not clear from my yammering till now, I would definitely suggest running the game in "challenge" mode (and play, too!). The PCs are not protagonists whose moral decisions we should be biting our nails over (on a related note, fuck the whole "paladin falling" noise), they're heroes there to kick ass (and maybe save the world). A lot of people slip from challenge mode into what I'd call "epic fantasy fanfic mode" where the PCs are heroes there to kick ass and save the world, except they don't kick ass by beating hard challenges but because we want them to and the game is rigged. Another consideration is the game type: sandbox or adventure path? Discuss these options with your players.<br/><br/>If you're running in challenge mode, characters can die, which can be a pain in the ass, especially if the player has invested a lot. Thankfully, generations of D&amp;D players for 40 years have figured out a bunch of solutions to this, from the "Turn body over" check to negative HP (at least until they get resurrection magic). Don't be afraid to play hard against them, but (a) don't make it your agenda to beat them, ever and (b) don't fuck them over (just fuck up).<br/><br/>A thing I've often seen happen with D&amp;D DMs (I don't know if it's just with the people I play with) is that often play their monsters stupid as hell, like machines. Even when the tide of battle is clearly turned against them they will desperately fight till the end. Pre-3.x D&amp;D had a clever little thing called a morale check. You don't need it but always ask yourself: Why is the monster there? Has it come for food? Theft? Is it guarding something or someone? Is it actually a mindless killing machine? Have monsters run away, regroup, readdress tactics, pursue specific goal, don't have them just go WAAAGH at the players till someone's HP drops to 0. Incidentally, don't make fights about HP dropping to 0 in general. Whittling one another's HP down can often get boring fast - try to make most fights <i>about</i> something or <i>for</i> something, with some "win" condition or at least tactical concerns other than just killing everyone.<br/><br/>Oh, a common house-rule that I'm not sure if it's actually official in Pathfinder or not: <b>maximum HP at first level</b>, definitely.<br/><br/>You can do a "players roll everything" hack that will alleviate some weight from your shoulders at the table. For saving throws, add 12 to your monster's modifier to make a static defense and the player rolls d20+caster level+stat bonus(+other).  For AC, add 12 to the monster's attack and the players roll d20+all usual AC bonuses.<br/><br/>Ugh, that was long.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332398/#Comment_332398" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T01:05:23+00:00" title="June 30, 2011  1:05AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 30, 2011 1:05AM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>while much smarter people have mired themselves in drudgery by Solving D&amp;D.</blockquote>\nI dunno about "smarter", but...

I highly recommend E6. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wordman</cite><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>1. Every time you fail a skill or attack roll, gain a special colored D6. You can spend any number of these D6s to help someone else (even when it isn't your turn) by saying how you help, and then rolling the D6s and adding their results as a bonus to anyone else's failed rolls.</blockquote>\nDo you have this helping require actions, or just narration? Given the crunchy nature of Pathfinders movement and action system, I'm wondering how you deal with that.<br/>Helping is a free action but the narration has to make sense with what is established on the battle map. You have to be able to help without changing your position.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332585/#Comment_332585" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T18:29:16+00:00" title="June 30, 2011  6:29PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The number one thing I did with 3E that improved the game for me was to change the setting such that PCs were explicitly superheroes. <br/><br/>Secret techniques taught by a half-dozen rival schools could give a person incredible fighting prowess, magical power, the ability to withstand incredible damage, and superhuman reflexes. Each class had one to three schools, each with rules and requirements for membership. Some schools had access to particular unique feats and class abilities, as well as prestige classes.<br/><br/>What that did for me was make the setting fit much more naturally with the rules, which made it easier to come up with interesting challenges, and to have those challenges have consequences for the world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20L" title="Dave L"><img alt="Dave L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20L">Dave L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332606/#Comment_332606" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T21:33:11+00:00" title="June 30, 2011  9:33PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I was going to DM 3E again, here are the few things I'd do:<br/>\n<br/>\n* For casters, have all damage taken since the caster's last turn force a Concentration check.<br/>\n* Forget about the monster building guidelines; just come up with some cool abilities and eyeball the stats based on other monsters.<br/>\n* Steal Reaction Rolls from B/X (adjust to 3d6 to fit in higher Cha bonuses).<br/>\n* Steal Morale directly from B/X, using the 2d6 roll and modifiers from B/X Charisma scores and everything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
