The group's made up of a bunch of friends, but we're all in different places now, so we have to game over the Internet (we use Skype). We try to game every week on Saturday. The problem I've been encountering lately is that, for whatever reason, we're having extraordinary difficulty getting the same group of people to come every week. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know that, theoretically, this is a social contract issue, and there are a number of things that are likely going on beneath the surface, including an opinion and mindset which allows some of the players to view these Saturdays as entirely optional and not that important. But there are some social issues here that I can't quite get around, arising from stuff like one guy having to travel for work, and another having to study a great deal for med school. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy question, then, is not focused on how to socially deal with this problem of having different people show up every week. I'm curious if there is a mechanical way to attack the problem. Specifically, I noticed that in Mouse Guard, there is a mechanic for dealing with a player who misses a session, and I think it's brilliant. It might not work perfectly with such a shifting cast, but then again, if we play one season per session, it might work wonders. So I was wondering if there are any other games with a similar mechanic, or if there might be ways to adapt a game to include such a mechanic. For example, I am currently reading (and DELIGHTED WITH) Apocalypse World, and I really really really want to run it, though I don't fully understand it all yet. Would it be possible to set up a system in which, if one player was absent for a session, maybe his or her characters were out running an errand for the Hardhold? They get back, and you use a custom move to let them roll, and see what the outcome of the errand was? Is this a feasible option, do you think?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I think I have noticed that playing small, self-contained sessions is vital to being able to play with a shifting cast of players, which means that in some of the long-form games we have played, we tended to effectively play a series of one-shots, instead of any deep-involving story lines. This significantly diminished the overall impact of playing a long-form game, however, also partly because the characters were not developing as much as we would have liked (as a symptom of the way we were playing the game, not as a symptom of the changing cast of players). I would like to play multi-session story-lines, but if you can't guarantee that you'll have the same group next week, then such story-lines can often become cumbersome, and you might lose momentum. So, unless someone has a good suggestion for how to do such a multi-session arc in this situation, I'm naturally sticking with single-session stories. Is there a system, then, that can accommodate this well? I turn to Mouse Guard again for its Gm/Player Turn organization, which gives each session a full structure, and makes it its own unit. Is this structure present in any other game of which I might not be aware? Furthermore, is it possible to implement such a structure in other games (like, say, Apocalypse World)? Or is such a structure not even necessary in some games, to play in the way I've described?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny help that you fine folk can give me would be much appreciated!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286707/#Comment_286707" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T09:52:51+00:00" title="August 16, 2010  9:52AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about running a game where the players are hackers or disparate computer users.  When people are unavailable, their coms / userid goes silent.  This type of game would play to the strength of your group and you could save major happenings for sessions where everyone is there.<br/><br/>As a great reference for what I'm talking about, read Cory Doctorow's "When Sysadmins Ruled the World" in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wastelands-Apocalypse-John-Joseph-Adams/dp/1597801054/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1281976759&amp;sr=8-3" rel="nofollow">Wastelands: Stories of the Apocalypse</a>.  Its a great anthology and this story in particular is amazing.  The short story details the remaining computer users following an apocalyptic mass casualty event - very compelling.<br/><br/>See also my comment on <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12632&amp;page=1#Item_6" rel="nofollow">snipers and hackers</a> about incorporating absent characters as snipers/hackers/decision makers.<br/><br/>Correspondences are a big part of the Cthulhu Mythos' writing.  In a similar vein, perhaps absent players could, if they knew they would be absent, send correspondence to the rest of the players to detail information they've uncovered, prompt action, or request aid.  If you play your cards right, you could ask the player to include specific details that were relevant to the story you running that session.<br/><br/>Just some ideas...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286709/#Comment_286709" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T09:58:20+00:00" title="August 16, 2010  9:58AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can answer about Apocalypse World, at least.
