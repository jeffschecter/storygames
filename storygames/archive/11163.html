And I realized: I haven't bought any new RPGs for like a year!  Partially because I've been buying more board games, partially because I've been running the same RPG with two friends since spring (and I have been buying supplements for that).  But anyway, I think it may be time to rectify this, but I've been kind of out of the loop, haven't been hanging around S-G as much as I used to.<br/><br/>So what's hot and awesome these days?  What should I be excited about?  Who should I give some of my money to immediately?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248043/#Comment_248043" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-22T08:13:35+00:00" title="December 22, 2009  8:13AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What do you like?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248048/#Comment_248048" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-22T08:36:21+00:00" title="December 22, 2009  8:36AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like cool stuff with cool settings and/or cool mechanics!<br/>If you really want, I could rattle off a list of the games I already have and think are cool... but I'd rather hear about stuff that you think is really cool.

SwM is the smallest viable sword &amp; sorcery game I've seen - very experimental and quirky, sure to provoke ideas; two-player game, very intimate. Trollbabe is the premier choice for an introductory vanilla narrativist game, with the sort of hippy Nordic fantasy setting I can get behind.</li>\n<li><a href="http://lotfp.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">James Raggi</a> makes artistic, original old school D&amp;D adventure modules, starting this year. They're cheap and very ambitious, making for excellent reading for the ideas even if you don't run them as is. This year's fare includes heavy metal fantasy, historical comedy of manners and a traphouse dungeon.</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/manufacturers.php?manufacturerid=87" rel="nofollow">MSG\u2122</a> is an under-appreciated game of cynical, idealistic corporate cyberpunk. I especially like the scenario-based design: half of the book consists of ready-made scenarios you just plug and play in an episodic manner.</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.museoffire.com/Games/MiseryBubblegum/" rel="nofollow">Misery Bubblegum</a> is a nigh-impenetrable text, but I think the game itself shows great promise. The cards are pretty, too, so it's justified as a boardgame purchase, too.</li>\n<li><a href="http://imaginationsweatshop.com/?cat=6" rel="nofollow">Time &amp; Temp</a> is an original, under-publicized game of time travel adventure - reminds me of <i>Dr. Who</i>, <i>Quantum Leap</i> and other time travel tv shows. The well-considered, focused simulationistic design is a breath of fresh air in a market dominated by generic, unfocused simulationism.</li>\n</ul>\nAlso, my own <i>World of Near</i> is starting to seem like an overlooked gem - I think it's the best book of its kind out there right now, but nobody seems to be reading it. I'm subjective about it, obviously, and I'm starting to see in hindsight that the book is pretty complex and dense, perhaps too much so for the average audience not obsessed with the world of Near.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248051/#Comment_248051" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-22T08:45:10+00:00" title="December 22, 2009  8:45AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://thoughtfulgames.com/montsegur1244/index.html" rel="nofollow">Montsegur 1244</a>, then.

Also, very sadly Misery Bubblegum doesn't seem to be available right now (and hasn't been for a few months, I don't think)<br/><br/>Time &amp; Temp is also on my radar and has been since I heard about it a long time ago on a podcast interview.  I'm definitely seriously considering picking that one up.<br/><br/>MSG I'd heard about before and looked over a free beta version or something.  It looked interesting but didn't grab me hard at the moment.  I'll check it out again though.<br/><br/>S/lay w/me I've heard mentioned before but don't know much about... I'm not sure how interested I am in a 2 player RPG, but I'll check it out.<br/><br/>Thanks for the suggestions!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
