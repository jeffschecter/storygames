I never met him (in person anyway). Have you?<br/><br/><i>I have met dozens, perhaps over a hundred, very experienced role-players with this profile: a limited repertoire of games behind him and extremely defensive and turtle-like play tactics. Ask for a character background, and he resists, or if he gives you one, he never makes use of it or responds to cues about it. Ask for actions - he hunkers down and does nothing unless there's a totally unambiguous lead to follow or a foe to fight. His universal responses include "My guy doesn't want to," and, "I say nothing."<br/><br/>I have not, in over twenty years of role-playing, ever seen such a person have a good time role-playing. I have seen a lot of groups founder due to the presence of one such participant. Yet they really want to play. They prepare characters or settings, organize groups, and are bitterly disappointed with each fizzled attempt. They spend a lot of money on RPGs with lots of supplements and full-page ads in gaming magazines.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363510/#Comment_363510" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T14:59:34+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  2:59PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Passive players who contribute nothing but get great satisfaction out of being at the table definitely exist.

But first the non-controversial part:<br/><br/>Yes.  In fact there are certain games I won't run at my local convention because the premise of the game attracts these kinds of players... who then don't actually engage the premise.  And many of the games attract the SAME set of problem people over and over again.  So they show up, do not contribute and then show up AGAIN, AGAIN to continue to not contribute.  I've made the joke that I, "only run games that don't sound fun" to avoid these players.  I word my con entries in extremely academic ways and make deep references to source literature so that I will only get highly interested, highly invested players.  Frankly, it's sad and exhausting.<br/><br/>My poor friend Morgan, alas, really enjoys running high concept genre mashup games.  He comes to the table because he wants the high energy of a celebratory geek out over the source fiction.  He draws these players like flies to honey and I've slowly watched him descend into anger and burn out because of it.  These players ROUTINELY show up and ROUTINELY don't contribute and worse, if asked, often admit to not knowing the genre or the game (usually FATE for Morgan).  When asked why they show up they say things like, "It sounded interesting."<br/><br/>Okay, now the controversial part:<br/><br/>If you ASK these players, "Did you have fun?"  They will say, "Yes."  But their language will be very non-committal and said without enthusiasm.  Their body language will communicate a general sense of "meh."  If probed about WHAT was fun they usually don't have an answer.  Just a general sense of, "Well, it was interesting."<br/><br/>So, the sense I get is that, no, they didn't have fun.  They had as good a time as they think they can have from an RPG which keeps drawing them back because the *promise* is so intriguing but it never quite delivers on what they want because they don't have the tools (creative, procedural, mechanical, social, emotional, whatever) to get what they want.  And they've been grasping at the ephemeral promise for SO LONG they can't even tell you want they want anymore.  They've kind of forgotten.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363544/#Comment_363544" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T16:08:38+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  4:08PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2012 4:08PM by Mathalus.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't met this person, but are they talking about an example <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=15949&amp;page=1#Item_0" rel="nofollow">over here?</a><br/><br/>(about post 36) <br/><br/>It looks like this might have been a case, although I certainly wasn't there and might be over stepping.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363546/#Comment_363546" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T16:14:03+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  4:14PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite><br/><br/>I don't think you're going to like this answer.  </cite></blockquote>\nI don't understand what part of your answer you thought would upset me.<br/><br/>It all sounded perfectly reasonable to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363547/#Comment_363547" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T16:16:25+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  4:16PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zak S</cite>Definitely a turtle.<br/><br/>Definitely does not have fun.<br/><br/>Definitely keeps playing for years.</blockquote>\nI've met people like this, <i>except</i> the "not have fun" bit is not quite on target.

They were part of "the early 90's LARP scene" from the small town I moved away from, for years they'd start a game only to say "its not working out" after a few sessions, then...do it all over again. <br/><br/>When I'd run a game, they would literally stare at me and say nothing, until I told them what happened, then they'd loosely participate in whats going on. They'd always try to weasel out of danger or making hard choices. I was often told I needed a better story...but when they ran games, the "storyteller" would basically say what everyone else was supposed to do, and told players their character background. If as a player you went outside that paradigm, it was socially dangerous [thats a tangent for another time]. Then a few sessions later, they'd all admit the game wasn't good, and assume it was the rules (which they ignored in play, so that confused me) or the story wasn't good enough.<br/><br/>They still attempt to game last I heard, and its still...the same process.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363557/#Comment_363557" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T16:32:34+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  4:32PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>If you ASK these players, "Did you have fun?"

I don't think they are the type - but I have no mind-reading powers to tell if they are having fun or not having fun.  They seem to be to me.  <br/><br/>I remember in particular a touching story I heard from Malik Hyltoft - who is a teacher at \xd8sterskov Efterskole, a progressive Danish public school that uses LARP as its thematic focus for teaching all subjects.  He told about how in one historical game he saw a kid who wasn't participating much with the others, and was using a shower curtain as his costume.  His initial reaction, he said, was to be annoyed at this kid for blowing off the class - but he went and asked the boy about what he was doing.  The boy didn't respond much at the time.  However, much later, the boy came and confronted him with a picture of an outfit from the time period that did indeed look like that shower curtain.  With this as his lead-in, the boy said a lot more about everything he had been thinking about his character and the period and the costumes.  It seemed to him that the boy was very deeply involved, but in a mostly private way because he was a mostly private person.  <br/><br/>I came away from that with insight not just as a role-player but also as an educator for respecting different ways that students engage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363564/#Comment_363564" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T16:43:22+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  4:43PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are probably a few people at my local convention who think I'm this guy. Because when I'm with a table full of high energy hyper-creative super enthusiastic players, I'll turtle a lot more than they will. <br/><br/>I think/hope I've gotten a lot better about it over the years. To the point where, nowdays, I can sometimes help carry a dull table. That happened the weekend before last, where I was at a table with 2 empty vacuums, 1 sarcastic sniper, and 1 over the top spotlight hogger dude. I fed leads to the spotlight hogger dude, because I wasn't going to be able to compete with his play style. So a lot of the game was watching him and the GM riff off each other, with me adding key contributions here and there and the other 3 players being more audience than contributor. That being said, both the hogger and the GM (oh, and the assistant GM too, she was awesome) were highly entertaining.<br/><br/>And that's the thing, I think the turtle can be entertained, even if he's not heavily engaged with the game. He's just being entertained in a more passive, TV-like way.<br/><br/>I think that's the part where Ron is projecting an assumption that the person he's talking about is not having fun.<br/><br/>Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that there is some missed potential there. That the person would probably have considerably more fun if they engaged more heavily with the activity.<br/><br/>But, along similar lines, I can't understand why people would watch sports on TV. It just seems so completely passive and unengaging, when compared to actually participating in a sport. I think my assumptions and prejudices about sports fans who only observe sporting events are similar to Ron's assumptions and prejudices about people who are super passive and turtle-y in RPGs.<br/><br/>And we're probably both at least partially wrong in our assumptions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363566/#Comment_363566" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T16:46:15+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  4:46PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Met that guy? Sure thing. In fact, I wasn't that far from this profile myself at one point: after spending my teenage years in lukewarm, occasionally mildly entertaining roleplaying endeavours, our teen group slowly stopped playing rpgs over the latter end of high school. I had other things in my life, so might well have ended my rpg hobby altogether, but had this not been the case, I can totally see myself sliding into this pattern of activity: narrow gaming background (trad style railroaded adventure games in my case, MERP and such) and non-functional play habits. Certainly I'd been playing for something like five years at that point with as much entertainment gained from the <i>idea</i> of roleplaying as the actual execution we managed. As it happened I stumbled on that very article and other Forge stuff after a few years of practical inactivity, and found that Ron could explain remarkably well why our youthful games so rarely ended in satisfaction.<br/><br/>More recently, I meet people who might be this way now and then. It's difficult to say with a chance encounter, but if I'm any judge, this frustrated failure thing is not too uncommon, especially among younger roleplayers. Often the "failed" roleplayer is young or socially awkward, so he either hasn't left the hobby <i>yet</i> or he simply doesn't have anything better to replace it with.<br/><br/>One thing that occurs to me in this regard is that local rpg microclimates differ from each other enormously. I've visited dozens of conventions over the last decade in Finland and internationally, and the games that are being played and the social circumstances of play wary dramatically from place to place. In some places unsatisfactory circumstances like those Ron describes are more common than in others. I've met gamers who've always been happy with their rpg sessions, but I've also met many who were clearly not used to having fun. Speaking solely for Finland, this has often seemingly involved tightly wrapped assumptions about real character roleplaying (players focus so hard on character depiction that the structures of the specific game they're playing fail to engage), or GM-player power conflicts that center on plot direction: as was the case with me, it seems to me that most Finnish gamemasters spent the '90s deep in the railway yard.<br/><br/>Now that I am the older hobbyist in a local scene that has regularly incoming youths, I can reflect a bit on my experiences. My guess is that rpg scenes that involve oral transmission and play between experienced gamers and newcomers suffer less from drastically incomplete play habits, for obvious reasons. RPG texts simply are not very good, or at least haven't used to be before the Internet came around, so it's not surprising if many local microclimates end up with unsatisfactory play habits when those texts are the only guidance they have. It's certainly true that the current teenagers have an easier time having fun rpg sessions with me involved than we did in the early '90s, when we had to work out everything by trial and error. Skill counts in this endeavour.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363569/#Comment_363569" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T16:49:07+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  4:49PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hans c-o</cite>I'm sure that's true in some situations, Jason, but I'm sure what Jesse is saying is also true.

However, most of the ones I can think of differ from Edwards's version in a significant way: they really, really want to show you that they do have fun. Or maybe they complain about their games and how they never work out, but if you actually try to figure out which parts aren't fun for them and why, they suddenly get all defensive and spend a lot of energy trying to convince you that, no, they ARE having fun, and lots of it. <br/><br/>I'm reminded of some gaming groups which consist of people who are always dreaming about their next big campaign. The current game seems to be fizzling, or actively dying it, people mysteriously don't show up to the games, but they're all really excited about the *next* campaign. The pitch for the next campaign is always some variation on, "this time we'll fix all the problems we had in the last one by doing [this other thing]!" Lots of enthusiasm for future play, but the current game always seems to suck and none of these dream campaigns seem to last more than a handful of sessions before people feel disappointed or burned out or angry.<br/><br/>Maybe not exactly like Ron's description (which is pretty extreme, although I know a couple of those guys, too--it's not that they don't have fun, it's more like they have one very specific way of having fun, and they're happy waiting through several sessions where they don't have much fun just to get that one thing to happen). But something similar, or at least related.<br/><br/>Edit: On several occasions I've gamed with people like these in some kind of fun, exciting session (at cons, or as guests in a game, etc). Afterwards, they look simply shocked. Like they never expected this from roleplaying. They can't believe what just happened in this game! It was fun in a way they're really not used to. I can't conclude for sure that this means they don't normally have fun in their games, but it's certainly one possible explanation.<br/><br/>I recently played in a session of an intense, ongoing long-term campaign all the players were really excited about. Boy, the enthusiasm was HUGE! However, that's not what I saw at the tabel. The game session was incredibly long (by my standards): about six hours. However, several players showed up an hour and a half late, and didn't seem too concerned about it. Several people fell asleep at the table multiple times. The players spent more time arguing than actually playing, to the point where a decision about how to open a window (which, in the end, they decided not to do at all) took over an hour. Afterwards, though, they were all about the good moments, which happened a couple of times in those six hours. So I can certainly understand the "20 minutes of fun in four hours" concept of RPG play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363606/#Comment_363606" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T18:42:53+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  6:42PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've met several of him over the years.

I've seen more than a few people who make me wonder if they're having fun, because what they are doing (or rather, not doing) in the game seems to me like it isn't fun at all, but...I don't know for a fact whether they are or aren't.<br/><br/>I've also met a few people who seemed at first to be non-fun-having turtles sitting like lumps at the table, and mostly figured out why they were there.  (Sometimes by asking them!  I know, it's so weird!)  In all three cases, they had at least one thing about the game itself that engaged them (system/setting mastery, for example), but really attended the game for the social hanging-out-with-friends aspect.  If we'd switched our weekend game for some other structured activity that had at least one appealing quality, I think they would have been just as happy.<br/><br/>Someone here once made what I thought was a great observation: if your game is a way for your friends to hang out and someone at the table is much more interested in that part than in the game, it doesn't have to be a bad thing.  Sometimes, if the friends-hanging-out part is valuable to everyone, you can keep the game moving while letting a passive "just tell me when to roll" person drop in or out as their mood suits them throughout a session.  So what if they avoid the spotlight, so what if they aren't 100% focused on the story?  That's not necessarily a game-breaker.  Sometimes everyone is okay with Dan playing what amounts to a walk-on role in the story when it means that they can spend some time with him on Saturday drinking and shooting the shit, and/or also be able to talk some game stuff with him during the week.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363609/#Comment_363609" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T18:48:56+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  6:48PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played 3rd ed D&amp;D for years without having much fun.

The only one of them with whom I've had Paul's experience of getting them to play with other people at a fun, exciting con session is also the only one with whom I'm still really friends. All the other guys aren't the kind of person who would expose themselves to an unknown social situation like a con; some of them aren't exposing themselves to the world outside their mom's house any more than strictly necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fun this group has is zero sum; it's at someone else's expense. I was frustrated that my attempts to help the guy who has always been at the bottom of this pecking order to make a character who can do things effectively went nowhere. Eventually I realized he was as invested in being a loser, regardless of whichever cool things his character was capable of, as the others were in showing they were winners by picking on him. I guess it's good news that this bottom dog left the group, but it was remarkable to see him turn over a character sheet with the win button on the front, looking for his other options. I left the group too but have enjoyed talking to my friend about each of their next big campaigns; that's the kind of daydream nation to which we both happily belong.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I think that the degree to which your experience of life consists of "I will meet new people and see if they are interested in having a good time together" has a strong negative correlation to the frequency with which you will meet That Guy. I totally buy the idea that if you are into in meeting weird dudes you will find a lot of them, and that the failure to examine your own mindset could lead to wrong conclusions. The fact that people who get really into conspiracy theories frequently vanish mysteriously doesn't mean that conspiracies are real, it just means that your life expectancy decreases the more you surround yourself with characters on the way-out fringe.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe part that's relevant to turtling is that in the first game I played with this reformed group, my friend ran a super high lethality slog through the underdark using D&amp;D; 3.5. I was happy because there were real challenges, and the time I've seen this friend happiest was when he was in the infantry where getting shot at cut right through the bullshit dominance behavior that constituted our civilian life together, so we were totally grooving on stepping right up. But the other alpha dog in this group bitched all the time about how we weren't roleplaying. Trying to figure out what he meant, it seemed like it boiled down to "I want to be in a tavern where everyone is either another PC or a NPC barmaid, both of whom are there for me to browbeat about how their understanding of my dwarven culture or lawful alignment is wrong, and nothing will ever offer the chance of failure."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noah_D" title="Noah_D"><img alt="Noah_D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noah_D">Noah_D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363622/#Comment_363622" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T19:44:26+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  7:44PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2012 7:51PM by Noah_D.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marshall Burns</cite>All that being said, there's a musician equivalent of this guy, and I've met him like a million times.</blockquote>\nCould you elaborate on that?

As we sometimes identify what we're doing as shared creation of a story, maybe 'shared creation of music' has some sort of parallel?<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, 90% of the time he's a guitarist. He often has the best and most gear of anybody in the group. He usually has decent, workmanlike technique. He knows how to play several songs by Led Zeppelin, Clapton, and AC/DC, but you rarely hear him play them for more than a few bars at a time.<br/><br/>He's super-excited about putting a band together. He shows up to practice on time, every time (unlike, say, the singer or drummer), but he doesn't do much while he's there. He'll dick around with the drums and the keyboard while nobody's playing, and chat about music, and play a few bars of Led Zeppelin, but doesn't contribute anything in terms of ideas or suggestions of songs to play. He'll practice along with the group in a lackluster, workmanlike sort of way, like he's not really enjoying it, but he's just as likely to "take a break" while everyone else is playing. If you run ideas by him, all you'll get is, sounds cool man. If you ask him what songs he wants to play, all you get is, I dunno man.<br/><br/>If, by some strange twist of fate, you get a gig, he'll be sick that day, or he'll have lost his guitar cables, or he'll turn his amp so low that you can't hear him.<br/><br/>When the band breaks up, you meet him again a few weeks later, and he's in another band (and another the next month, and the next, and the next...).<br/><br/>(I say "he" because I've never met a woman that fits this profile. Although, come to think of it, my brother told me about one. Oddly enough, she was a singer.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363667/#Comment_363667" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T22:08:43+00:00" title="February 28, 2012 10:08PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2012 10:10PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Zak,<br/><br/>I've talked to Ron a little about this.

If the bad guys ambush them, they hate it. If their plan leaves something to chance, they are suspicious of it. If the first plan doesn't work, the task is impossible.  It's interesting. They had the same problem with Smallville.  "I can't sidle up to this challenge by making preparation A, B, C, D, and E."  Because in the end the challenge rules in Smallville don't give (much of) a shit beyond saying "Wow, you're such a great fucking planner, good for you. The other guy is a Big Mouth Jerk, that gives him the same advantage that your plan does."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE

Then they disappeared as my group got smaller and more focused. Also at conventions in Sweden most players I met were extroverted actor types. <br/><br/>But a year or so back, I worked for some time in a new town and hooked up with one local large (20+ players) gaming group. And was astonished at how they were sitting around, joking, messing about, or turtling, without contributing or pushing the game forward. They were all like this. I couldn't - and still can't - get my head around why they chose a investment-heavy activity such as RPGs rather than watching a movie together or playing video games. Cause to me it seemed thy really just wanted to hang out and socialise. <br/><br/>They were very keen to play, well-organised (both offline and online), and identified as hard-core RPG gamers. They set up mini-cons, LARPs etc. They were heavily invested in their hobby and identity, but they did not invest energy or effort in any RPG session I'd seen them in. <br/><br/>I was amazed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_363694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363694/#Comment_363694" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T23:50:19+00:00" title="February 28, 2012 11:50PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had a lot of such players in my groups through the years, and have learned that they indeed get some fun out of it.

If they're very shy/introverted, the roleplaying game gives them a structure to hang their interactions off, even if they seem to be standing quite back from the game?  I've seen people flower from observer to actor that way, but I guess everyone does it in their own time.  <br/><br/>On the other hand, there's this one guy I know who I wouldn't say turtles, but he often seems very detached from the plot lines and characters compared to other players in his groups, and I think it makes him unhappy.  He's also very self aware and analytical, so puts in a lot of words talking about his game experiences which can come across as quite critical.  Thing is, every now and then, something about a game he's in goes Just Right and he's entirely engaged and focused on that one game.  And those occasional experiences are enough bait that he'll keep on trying, and keep trying to nail down exactly what happened so that he can replicate it, and then get frustrated again because he can't <i>make </i>the great times just happen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus" title="nikodemus"><img alt="nikodemus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus">nikodemus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363712/#Comment_363712" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T01:30:42+00:00" title="February 29, 2012  1:30AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 29, 2012 1:31AM by nikodemus.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was going to say that I never met the guy, but then I realized I may have sort of been that guy.<br/><br/>For the first 10 or so years of my gaming life I was pretty introverted, and not very good at expressing myself.

I'm not as much of a turtle as Ron says in that quote: "Ask for a character background, and he resists, or if he gives you one, he never makes use of it or responds to cues about it." But I do often find it hard to quickly think and speak in character, which makes me tend to avoid doing so and often keeps me on the quieter side.

Yes, it frustrates the hell out of me as a player or GM, but here's what I've come to believe.<br/><br/>Everyone at the role-playing table is playing a different game than what's actually going on.  I mean, so much goes unsaid, (only thought out or day-dreamed,) in your head, more than you realize, about the fiction.  Some people try to verbalize that a lot, describing every little twirl of the mustache in their fictional head-space.<br/><br/>These guys don't.  There's a ton of stuff going on up there, just like everyone else, and they just flatly refuse to share.  It's better to let it run it's course in their own mind than to risk letting someone else mess with it.  (I use guys, but it applies to women as well.)<br/><br/>The cool thing is, sometimes it works out.  Some magical times you can work past that and get them to contribute, something, anything, and accept or reject it maturely and convince them it's cool to share.<br/><br/>Just my two cents.  I mean it's obvious that they get something out of it or they wouldn't keep doing it.  Maybe it's something as base as just being around other human beings for a while, but I'd like to believe their benefits are all internal.  And (when I have the time and energy) I like to try to engage them and get them to share.  I guess I still feel Ron's pain, though.  They do tend to drag down energy level and make people suspicious, questioning the value of contributing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363733/#Comment_363733" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T05:40:07+00:00" title="February 29, 2012  5:40AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 29, 2012 5:42AM by GB_Steve.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a game of Buffy for Eden Studios at Gen Con UK in 2001(?). One of the players came up to me beforehand and begged to play the Buffy character (it was set in Victorian London). I was very happy for him to do so, given his enthusiasm for the game. However when it came round to playing, he did nothing at all. I can't even remember him once saying what his character was doing. So I had to declare all his actions. He was happy to roll dice and reveal the result but that really was the extent of his interaction with the game. Fortunately a couple of the other players were very proactive but it was rather frustrating. I think he just wanted to watch.<br/><br/>This doesn't mean I agree with Ron (about this or anything else).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363736/#Comment_363736" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T06:02:55+00:00" title="February 29, 2012  6:02AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, it's useful to not read too much into that observation of Ron's. I feel like I have a pretty good handle on what he's working at when he writes, and it's not like he's trying to be telepathic here. He's just like us, sharing some observations. Inescapably those observations are coloured by the way he understands the world, and in this case roleplaying.<br/><br/>I'm generally opposed to textual deconstruction of treatises where the author is still among us and capable of talking about it, so it would be better to ask Ron to explain himself than to try to guess. Still, we can talk about what utility we ourselves can draw from the texts and communications of other people, without implying that they think the same way we do. (This is in fact something I've never understood about the Great Forge Flame Wars: why is it more important what somebody thinks than whether their discussion inspires you onto something great? I don't agree about everything with Ron or anybody else, but I can still appreciate that they're provoking my own thinking. People sure are certain about their own wisdom in the Internet.)<br/><br/>For my own part, having read my share of Ron's writing, I'd like to note that Ron seems to appreciate interpersonal, genuine communication in roleplaying. His whole rpg theory defines roleplaying as interpersonal communication, the way I understand it: the Big Model excludes purely internal mental "roleplaying" as a matter of consideration because we understand roleplaying as a social endeavour. As I often say: if you could be doing this without those other guys with you at the table, why do you bother? Exploration of Shared Imagined Space is something that only happens by sharing with others, and a Creative Agenda is only substantiated by this process when the players truly understand what they and others in the group are doing; you want others to appreciate your actions in the game, otherwise you'd be playing alone.<br/><br/>In this light it makes perfect sense to see various difficult-to-categorize inwards-turning mental states as unhappy and unwanted. Of course we can go into headspaces and speculate about our own or other people's experiences while playing a game or watching paint dry, but that's very subjective and doesn't really seem like the focal point of Ron's interests. He writes about actual practice of what people do, not about what they think or feel. When he says that somebody is not having fun while roleplaying, he's not pronouncing something deep about mental states, he's just relying on his human perception about what's going on around him socially. Of course he might misunderstand what's going on, but we all have our experience in roleplaying: you get a pretty good sense of what the other players are thinking and feeling while doing it, unless you habitually play with true autists or completely weird people whose social cues you can't understand. Consider this, and consider Ron's inclination to emphasize social connection in the act of roleplaying, and it's pretty easy to see why he'd ascribe unhappiness to somebody who fails consistently in playing clearly and meaningfully. They sure might be having fun inside their heads, but from a certain viewpoint that seems like a replacement for the real fun of the activity.<br/><br/>Regardless of qualifications, though, I think that the basic observation is borne out by many people's experiences. That basic observation, that some people fail continuously in truly fulfilling their roleplaying ambitions, seems so self-evident to me that it's interesting that one would even feel the need to refute it. Ron doesn't say that you personally are unhappy, just that there seem to be a considerable number of unsatisfied roleplayers out there. I think that the response to his writing has borne out that even if not everybody finds his specific solutions useful, at least the basic idea of reform has resonated with many people. Obviously enough Ron's message in this is intended for others who share his own experiences; this won't be everybody, as we come from a splintered forest of local microcultures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363739/#Comment_363739" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T06:18:51+00:00" title="February 29, 2012  6:18AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zak S</cite>I don't know where Ron is or if he has the internet there</blockquote><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/index.php" rel="nofollow">Helpful link!</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/msphina" title="msphina"><img alt="msphina" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/msphina">msphina</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363742/#Comment_363742" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T06:27:12+00:00" title="February 29, 2012  6:27AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I've met That Guy - abstractly and specifically.

That's two orders of magnitude difference. Maybe I encountered an unusually low number, or maybe he encountered an unusually high number, but the degree of variance given how many roleplayers one can expect to meet in a year is really what arouses my suspicions.  Like, if I'd met hundreds of these guys, I might have some pretty ludicrous ideas about gaming too.<br/><br/>Then he reaches bizarre (dumb) conclusions about why the person is doing what they're doing. Your statement that he isn't too concerned with their internal mental state doesn't hold water in light of the rest of the essay. He very confidently says that these people are having "GNS meltdown"  Given that for most of the 1981-2001 period he couldn't possibly have asked them GNS-related questions because no such theory existed (and also because GNS is a garbage theory), the diagnosis is very suspect.<br/><br/>And why not refute things that are wrong?

Mostly gaming has become part of my identity and my social crutch.  If I didn't have RPGs, I'd turn into some kind of a hermit, and still be bored.  Plus I <i>like</i> RPGs, at least conceptually.

Remember, you only have to see them at the one con game where they're obviously not having fun.  Their next game might click but you don't know that if you're not also in it.<br/><br/>And I've sort-of even <i>been</i> that guy.  Not the turtling, but the not-having-fun part?  Sure!<br/><br/>I had <i>so much</i> fun playing RPGs as a kid that I basically didn't know how to have fun without them.  And this is still a little true.  That sounds a lot sadder than I feel my life is, but whatever.  (I know folks who forgot how to have fun without being high and they're still high, thirty years later.  Maybe it's related.)  But then, around 1990 -- ten years after I discovered RPGs, I was feeling kind of lost.  Things had changed.  I had changed.  It wasn't clicking for me but I didn't have anything else or know what else to do.  I mean, I played some fun games with friends, but I was always looking for more.  I was in numerous games from say '81 to '94 and attended 2-5 cons, including GenCon, every year during that period.  And some games were fun and some were not.  For all I know, I'm one of Ron's sample for that statement; we were only living five hours down the highway from one another for at least some of that period.  Eventually, I gave up, deciding that RPGs were no longer fun and found ways to redefine myself.<br/><br/>Maybe it looked like I was turtling when I wasn't having fun.

Sure thing. In fact, I wasn't that far from this profile myself at one point: after spending my teenage years in lukewarm, occasionally mildly entertaining roleplaying endeavours, our teen group slowly stopped playing rpgs over the latter end of high school....Now that I am the older hobbyist in a local scene that has regularly incoming youths, I can reflect a bit on my experiences. My guess is that rpg scenes that involve oral transmission and play between experienced gamers and newcomers suffer less from drastically incomplete play habits, for obvious reasons. RPG texts simply are not very good, or at least haven't used to be before the Internet came around, so it's not surprising if many local microclimates end up with unsatisfactory play habits when those texts are the only guidance they have. It's certainly true that the current teenagers have an easier time having fun rpg sessions with me involved than we did in the early '90s, when we had to work out everything by trial and error. Skill counts in this endeavour.</blockquote>\nSo, like a beautiful flower, you blossomed and grew, and now you are the rugged Nordic face of role-playing.

Played the shit out of AD&amp;D2e with friends in NJ and had a blast. Moved to Chicagoland, where I played the shit out of AD&amp;D2e (mostly Dark Sun), TORG and various Palladium games and had a blast.<br/><br/>College: Went to college. Kept buying and reading games/gamebooks on the side. Was far more into friends/women/DJing/doing other stuff/studying those days, and yet I still "loved RPGs", despite not playing them as much. Maybe played only 10 "fun" sessions in college (AD&amp;D 2e, Star Wars d6, a few other random games like Cyberpunk). I was involved with a group of AD&amp;D 2e guys mostly my Freshman-Sophomore year, and played with them on and off a bunch. But!<br/><br/>* I was definitely turtling. Any time I tried to be "out there", I got smacked down or ignored (didn't fit the DM's plot) in some way or other, so I kinda gave up trying.<br/>* Definitely did not have that much fun. Although I wasn't quite sure why. At those times, I didn't have anything better to do (homework done, DJ mixing done, etc) so I showed up and enjoyed the company of Other Gamers, and Demi-friends. But it wasn't as good as those rare sessions (usually with other people).<br/>* Definitely kept playing for years. Hoping to have one of those "good experiences" again.<br/><br/>It was those other random sessions (or a visit to GenCon; namely some of the RPGA-organized events like Castle Falkenstein tourneys and AD&amp;D) that were just fun enough to keep me tagging along "being a gamer". Oh, and for some reason, RPG books were extremely interesting reads for me, even if I wasn't playing them. I've seen this "Exalted effect" (heh) online in the last ten years.<br/><br/>In any case, it wasn't Narrativism that got me back into awesome gaming sessions, it was realizing that the reason I wasn't having fun in certain sessions was asshole DMs and flaccid players. When I surrounded myself with other enthusiastic guys who weren't assholes and players that contributed and role-played, the sessions were fun. This is everything from AD&amp;D to Call of Cthulhu to Over the Edge to Blue Planet or Whatever. I got into some regular gaming groups in Japan (with folks like Stan!, Mike Montesa, Cam Eeles, other JIGG members mostly in Tokyo), played mostly "overall traditional but with some cool gimmicks" games, and had some genuine fun again. Almost totally forgot about the previous dry years in college.<br/><br/>It wasn't a few years after that that I found these new-style games, and I only liked them because they consistently paid off in the ways I liked my gaming, not because they were the Only Way To Salvation or whatever.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363828/#Comment_363828" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T09:46:53+00:00" title="February 29, 2012  9:46AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 29, 2012 10:59AM by Andy.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zak S</cite>I don't know where Ron is or if he has the internet there, but I am assuming--until he says otherwise--that he meant what he said and it accords with reality as he observed it and he was not exaggerating just to make a point.</blockquote>\nAs already indicated by Bret, he's on The Forge (that place where you read the essay).

I've played with some of these groups (and usually not returned after a few sessions): it's like the have some left-over idea that gaming is a fun thing, and it's part of their lives in a fundamental way, but it's like they've lost they actual joy of the activity.<br/><br/>Not unlike a stale marriage, perhaps. They keep coming back to it, because they've forgotten that they can make the choice to leave.<br/><br/>I've been in a gaming situation like that, too, I remember, with a group. We had "fun" (good, exciting sessions that weren't disrupted constantly by out-of-game arguing or just wasting time by complaining about how bad the previous session was or something similar) games maybe... one out of five or six sessions. That was enough to keep people coming back, plus it was some kind of ritual: Thursday night was game night, permanently inked in everyone's calendars.<br/><br/>I played in that group for about three years. There were some really good times... but they were relatively rare, perhaps just common enough to keep us all coming back.<br/><br/>I eventually left when I realized that these people were people I had no real desire to spend time with outside the game: they weren't really my friends. <br/><br/>(I don't think gaming--or sex--is like pizza. Better do something else than do it badly and not enjoy yourself.)<br/><br/>Ludanto, if you feel comfortable, I'd love to hear more about your group and your games!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363844/#Comment_363844" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T10:19:19+00:00" title="February 29, 2012 10:19AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 29, 2012 10:19AM by Sam!.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Also, a side point: This isn't the Forge, blah blah blah.</blockquote>\nThis is an important distinction to make.

I could see that being a lot of fun! Why not bring it into the game and get some mileage out of it? Do you prefer to keep that train of thought to yourself, because you enjoy it that way (bringing into the game proper, in other words, would be *less* fun for you)? Or maybe you've tried and been shot down by the group?<br/><br/>I know that for me, when I think of some people this discussion brings up, they weren't all quiet. Actually most were quite loud and/or extroverted. The defining feature was, rather, that they engaged in the game in ways which were really contrary to having a good time: either for them, or for the whole group. Tavis's post, in particular, rang a bell with me:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tavis</cite>The fun this group has is zero sum; it's at someone else's expense. I was frustrated that my attempts to help the guy who has always been at the bottom of this pecking order to make a character who can do things effectively went nowhere. Eventually I realized he was as invested in being a loser, regardless of whichever cool things his character was capable of, as the others were in showing they were winners by picking on him. I guess it's good news that this bottom dog left the group, but it was remarkable to see him turn over a character sheet with the win button on the front, looking for his other options.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wrshamilton" title="wrshamilton"><img alt="wrshamilton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wrshamilton">wrshamilton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363879/#Comment_363879" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T11:23:00+00:00" title="February 29, 2012 11:23AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 29, 2012 11:28AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I know that for me, when I think of some people this discussion brings up, they weren't all quiet.

Of course effectiveness was overrated since failure wasnt an option and even when failures did happen there were no actual consequences due to GM benevolence.  Still had problems with one player who shot down any ideas that were somewhat flamboyant or over the top.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat people were getting out of the game seemed to be getting in the internal headspace of their fictional character mostly about inconsequential things and the developing of character abilities over time.  I didnt connect with this and I really became a lump, unengaged with the fiction at all for the vast majority of play, but I kept going for friendship sake.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy I think it was GNS related was because at the same time I did play occasional games with some other friends that were completely different.  They were all one shot games with the people being harder to connect with but whenever we played the game was about a fictional situation and resolving it.  I was engaged in what was going on, I had agency to affect the situation through my character, I contributed enthusiastically.   If members of either group saw me play in the other they wouldnt recognize me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363896/#Comment_363896" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T12:04:29+00:00" title="February 29, 2012 12:04PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zak S</cite>I just wanted to know.

I've even been tempted to be that guy in games I've GMed, like the recent AW-hack where I wanted exploration of a weird and dangerous world, and the players wanted a game about dysfunctional relationships (though that was as much system/fiction clash as it was CA clash).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363912/#Comment_363912" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T12:38:32+00:00" title="February 29, 2012 12:38PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As long as I'm not that guy, what the fuck do I care?<br/>I mean, there's been games where I haven't had fun.<br/>I try not to think in absolutes.  <br/>I've gamed with some pretty guarded people.

Worry.  <br/>I mean, I can feel compassion for a person without having to worry.<br/>I think the whole relationship(GM/players)is a part of the problem, but that's just my opinion.<br/>One person shouldn't feel the need, or better yet the right to make someone else happy.<br/>It's a weird structure.<br/>Maybe you can't fix their inability to have fun?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363937/#Comment_363937" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T13:04:51+00:00" title="February 29, 2012  1:04PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 29, 2012 1:10PM by Mathalus.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nathan H.</cite><cite>Posted By: Zak S</cite>I care because if I am GMing and one of those players turns out to be That Guy I want to find out ways to make sure I can tell if they are having fun and to measure said fun.</blockquote>One person shouldn't feel the need, or better yet the right to make someone else happy.<br/>It's a weird structure.<br/>Maybe you can't fix their inability to have fun?<br/><br/>But maybe we can? That would be cool.

Do what you can to keep everyone else having fun and either write that seat off as a lost cause or just throw any random crazy idea you've got at him to see if something sparks his interest.<br/><br/>If it's a home game with friends, my preference for sussing out how people feel about the current game is to do it away from the game itself. Start up the old gaming warstories discussion when you're all hanging out doing something else, and listen to how they remember the games you've played together.  Basically, letting them tell you what they thought was fun about the games they've played in, without putting them on the spot and demanding that they quantify and justify their opinion.  If their favorite stories are about things that other players did with their characters, maybe that's a clue that what they really like most about gaming isn't being in the spotlight, but cheering on the people who are.  Or if they focus on the convoluted backstory of the setting, or if they fondly reminisce about the big fight scene that was only narrowly won, or if they talk about their character's internal reactions to the situations in the game...all of those are valid, fun things for that person, and definitely things that you can provide to them as a GM.<br/><br/>Or maybe they won't have any favorite stories about past games, and that might indicate that they aren't showing up on Saturday because they love the game, but because they love having something that their friends invite them to on Saturday...in which case, you can either find a different activity to scratch that itch for them, or make peace with the notion that this person likes the people in the group more than the game.  That's not a bad compliment, really.  (And if this person isn't a friend, then...whew.  That sucks.  Good luck with that, I guess.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363951/#Comment_363951" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T13:30:53+00:00" title="February 29, 2012  1:30PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 29, 2012 1:54PM by Zak S.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nathan H.</cite>It's misplaced.</blockquote>\nIf you accept that it is Ok to have a game with a GM in the first place I think it's important to realize sometimes there's some obscenely simple misconception holding a player back.

I'm somewhat confident it wasn't because he had a good day or something, but because something was different in the game. I never figured it out, though, but it seemed to me that sometimes the game clicked for him. Yes, I did ask him (and other players) which bits they liked. The answers weren't illuminating to me.<br/><br/>In hindsight, I could have tried to run sessions which were more obviously different -- and possibly even say something about the difference out loud. "Ok, fair warning: today it's nothing but slapstick." "You're in for death and gore." "Lots and lots of social stuff coming up!"<br/><br/>Had I done that, I might have been able to figure it out better.

When I do get to act, it's generally an uphill fight against the GM's plot-bus, making my contribution semi-meaningless.  Why am I even there?  If the game can go for three hours without my input, what does that say?<br/><br/>Conversely, if I am called upon to act, I either have no idea what to do (I'm not the proactive or even "big-picture" reactive in real life) or I feel put upon by the results of failure, because they aren't worth the price of success (whatever that means).<br/><br/>So, basically I'm just a bad player, which is quite frustrating, and I'm not getting what I want from RPG sessions.<br/><br/>Edit: Oops.

I won't avoid the main plot - I just don't make it the thing that I'm focused on and/or invested in.

If he doesn't, that's bad GMing.  If he does, and I don't like it... then we're simply not a good fit together in Plot Bus games, and I'd be pretty dead set on trying a different game, or finding a different group.<br/><br/>One thing I've seen happen is where there is in fact a role that I'd enjoy on the Plot Bus, but the GM hasn't identified it and/or figured out how to communicate it to me.  Often not through lack of trying!  So by calling that "bad GMing" I'm not saying he's a dick, just that he hasn't brought all the tools needed for the job.<br/><br/>I do think it's possible for a game to provide those tools.  For example, clarifying, "The players' job is to portray how their characters are emotionally affected by the GM's unfolding story."  That's what a lot of Plot Bus GMs want, but they feel like they're <i>supposed to</i> let the players impact events, so they sort of pretend try to enable such agency, but when push comes to shove, they give up and steer.  Or maybe impacting <i>certain</i> events is cool, and the GM just needs to communicate which are which.  "This is a Combat Scene, I won't let you die, but how hurt you get and how badass you look is up to you!" versus "This is a Free Scene, these cultists aren't key to my plot, do with them as you will!" versus "This is a Plot Scene, react while I blow your minds!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sbszine" title="sbszine"><img alt="sbszine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/471/nTYPQ57XSGLLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sbszine">sbszine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364029/#Comment_364029" name="Item_131" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T16:56:47+00:00" title="February 29, 2012  4:56PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We have an edge case in our regular AD&amp;D game, where there is a player who sits in silence until he gets a particular trigger.

Cue intense debate about whether such people are overrepresented within the RPG hobby/the hobby caters to them, but that's ultimately tangential: RPGing is a social activity and if your skills in that area are below a certain threshold, you can't do it. It's a great deal like dating, actually: if you aren't happy with your life as a whole, that's likely to render you less attractive. Most of my favorite people to game with really love their lives\u2014not that they don't have problems, just that they have other interests outside of gaming and are generally enthusiastic and broad-minded.<br/><br/>(I'll admit that the majority of my purely-social interactions are with my nerd brothers and sisters, but, I mean, at least I do other stuff with them than just game, you know.)<br/><br/>Still, I'm in general agreement with Zak here: if someone's not having fun because of something specific they're not getting out of the game, <i>rather than</i> because they're in a place where they simply can't be part of a gaming group, then it behooves the other members of the group (especially the GM, though not limited to the GM) to reach out to that person and adjust as much as they can. I know I've done that, and I've seen friends do it, and the results aren't always successful, but it's worth doing, and furthermore, it's really inconsiderate not to make some sort of effort.<br/><br/>In other words, Ludanto, your friends are being rude not to make more of a sincere effort to help you enjoy the game. Of course, your unwillingness to meet new people and try new things does you no favors.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my last point, which is that, despite my overall espousal of the principle that the group should work to help any players who aren't having fun, sometimes there is a genuine clash of preferences and desires which should (ideally anyway but haha to that) lead to an amicable split.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364048/#Comment_364048" name="Item_134" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T18:18:22+00:00" title="February 29, 2012  6:18PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zak S</cite><br/>My definition of good GMing is you knock yourself out, bend over backwards, jump through any hoop presented and, basically, within the bounds of what you have time and effort for, try to make sure<i>everyone</i>(including you) is having as much fun as you are able to do anything about.</blockquote>\nThat's cool, but I consider the players to have the exact same responsibilities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364067/#Comment_364067" name="Item_135" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T20:38:31+00:00" title="February 29, 2012  8:38PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite><cite>Posted By: Zak S</cite><br/>My definition of good GMing is you knock yourself out, bend over backwards, jump through any hoop presented and, basically, within the bounds of what you have time and effort for, try to make sure<i>everyone</i>(including you) is having as much fun as you are able to do anything about.</blockquote>\nThat's cool, but I consider the players to have the exact same responsibilities.Sure.

They may not want to be like that, but it's the best they can do at the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo answer Zak S' question, I have played with one person who did what Ron Edwards described. When GMing I try to make sure everyone gets some time in the spotlight, but this player didn't want it. He wasn't being a jerk, he just liked watching the game, and making some rolls when the situation forced him to.<br/>\nSince he liked being there and wasn't disruptive, I quit worrying about if he was having fun or not and just let him do his thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364090/#Comment_364090" name="Item_137" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T01:00:01+00:00" title="March  1, 2012  1:00AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 1, 2012 1:11AM by Hans_c-o.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            sigh.<br><br>There's a person (a woman, in this case) who comes to weekly game nights at the local game store. She says she's into roleplaying (and often says something like, "I haven't are-peed in like a week! I <i>need</i> it!).<br><br>But when people pitch games to play, she won't decide what to play in. Literally, someone will describe a gritty fantasy game with tactical options and someone else, say, Fiasco, and she will not choose. "I don't care! I just want to role-play!" Usually she ends up at whatever game lands at the table she was already sitting at.<br/><br/>In the games, she usually won't really read her character sheet (she has said, and I quote, "I don't want to read!") or care too much about how the game works--she just wants to interact with other characters in meaningless (in game-mechanical terms) ways. She doesn't drive the action, and won't take action unless things are forced on her character.<br/><br/>Usually it is atrocious playing with her, and I always wish I wasn't playing with her (I haven't figured out how to just, y'know, not play with her without her throwing an emotional fit and stomping out--she's done this to other people). However, there are clearly games (like Jake's anime games) that she is more in alignment with and enjoys more, and it's more bearable to play these games with her, but she can't (or won't) articulate this. It's unclear if she has fun, usually. She's super emotionally needy and has no boundaries, expecting this one pick-up largish game group to be her sole social outlet. When people discuss games they might run at home, longer-term (the game night is for one-shots), she'll say something clumsily manipulative like, "*sigh*, I wish I could play in a long-term campaign", even though we know she doesn't give two shits about Burning Wheel or whatever and would totally drag it down and not engage in it.<br/><br/>Bleh. I'm running a game tomorrow and I know I'll be frustrated and disappointed if she joins in, but it's <i>really</i> hard to say, "I don't want you to play this with me." Maybe I should just tell her I don't think we have compatible styles and I'd prefer not to play with her. Yeah. This is what I will do. Hold me to it, story games.

In this play environment it's going to be hard to manage a one on one conversation. Hans would probably have to flat-out ask her if they could step outside and talk. Which is still pretty singly-outy, and thus on shaky ground. The "address it to more than one person" tactic is good for avoiding this, but for the firmness that Hans is wanting to assert here, that may not be viable.<br/><br/>Damn, Hans. Good luck, brother.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364096/#Comment_364096" name="Item_143" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T03:16:22+00:00" title="March  1, 2012  3:16AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>To what extent are people in this thread actually<i>seeing different gamers</i>(i.e. I never saw people with the same qualities that Eero saw); and to what extent are we<i>imposing different interpretations</i>of the gamers that we have seen?</blockquote>\nYeah, this is a dominant issue, definitely, insofar as we're interested in proper research procedure. This is why I don't treat things like the original System Matters essay as truth-pronouncements to be savagely torn down or religiously upheld: even now, ten years since, these are merely ideas to be considered, matched with your own experiences and utilized, insofar as there is utility in them. For me there is, which I tend to treat as empirical evidence: evidently Ron's got something here, so for my part it makes sense to proceed and see what else might be built upon this foundation. Others with different experiences will refute these basic observations, like "many people are unsatisfied in their roleplaying", or "system matters". I like how Zak is investigating the reasons for why he's not feeling the truth in that essay that some other people are instead of starting a crusade to convince everybody about how wrong it is.<br/><br/>(Of course the "proper" social sciences research procedure here would be to agree upon some measures and get interviewing Those Guys to figure out whether Ron's experience and armchair analysis matches reality in some case studies, and then perhaps find out how wide-spread the phenomenon is, or whether him and others are simply knee-deep in attribution error. Good luck with that, to anybody who cares enough about the details.)<br/><br/>For my part, I've gotten generally good results by introducing people to different kinds of games, explaining clearly what those games expect of them, and finding some that match what that person is most interested in doing in roleplaying games. Having a solid core group helps immensely in this - if you've got one or two or three players who are flexible and can actually follow systemic instructions, then you can just bring them with you and have them model proper play for anybody who has trouble. Some few people are truly problematic because their social level is just too low for playing <i>anything</i> in much more than an audience role; I've come to get by even in these cases by playing games that enable players to take on low-commitment audience roles that allow them to immerse in character and contribute color, but does not require them to ever stand up and deliver, so to speak. For most people, though, matching them up with a game that better fits their needs results in dramatic improvement in excitement and engagement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364098/#Comment_364098" name="Item_144" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T03:29:53+00:00" title="March  1, 2012  3:29AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 1, 2012 3:31AM by Zak S.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite> I like how Zak is investigating the reasons for why he's not feeling the truth in that essay</blockquote>\nUm, <i>what?</i><br/><br/>I don't have an insane ulterior motive here.

I'd say that Ron is claiming a trend here, but not universality of any sort: obviously there is a happy roleplayer under a rock somewhere, how could somebody think differently just because there are unhappy ones as well?<br/><br/>(The Big Model in toto makes some general claims, but it is a complex topic for another time, I believe. Maybe it's not that far off, who knows? I for one wouldn't mind it if we didn't need to wait for all the original pundits to die off before taking new, critical and interesting - read: more than just refuting the ideas of others - looks on these matters.)<br/><br/>The above is actually what makes this discussion meaningful and interesting, the fact that it's not about analytic logic but rather about population demographics. Has anybody put any thought into why some people report widespread discontent while others find this phenomenon about a once in a lifetime occurrence? I posited upthread (unless it was in some whisper, can't remember) that local roleplaying microclimates tend to be powerfully profiled: roleplayers don't move a lot and tend to play in cliques and local social networks, which means that you don't get demographic bleed even between neighboring counties to the extent you get in eg. religious trending. If I'm correct in this characterization, then that would explain why people tend to have such differing observations on some pretty mundane rpg phenomena. The extent of dissatisfaction is one such thing, and just to pick a second example, the locally dominant games tend to be another. If you'd asked me into the '90s about whether roleplaying is difficult and often frustrating, I'd have answered in the affirmative simply because that was the case in the local scene in Upper Savo in the '90s. Similarly, if you'd asked me about what the most popular, significant and influential roleplaying games were, I'd have answered with Chaosium BRP and a few other '80s labels despite the fact that red box D&amp;D is apparently easily the most sold roleplaying game in Finland ever - it just was a game that <i>nobody</i> in our scene played, everybody thought that it's outdated and childish. I've since met Finnish roleplayers who lived a hundred kilometers from my home through the '90s and played almost exclusively D&amp;D through that era. I've also met roleplayers who have had only distant and occasional encounters with the high-strung, realism-oriented, preplay-heavy experientalist roleplaying style that we learned and grew up with.<br/><br/>Of course these things are rapidly changing now with the Internet, roleplayers simply encounter each other more and over greater distances. But to me it seems an utterly uncontroversial claim that the local culture in the next town over might have been entirely different from your own in the not too distant past - after all, did you go there and see for yourself? I didn't. In this world of cargo cult culture it is not an amazing thing at all that different gamers from different places report different degrees of dissatisfaction and functional forms of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364125/#Comment_364125" name="Item_148" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T06:04:38+00:00" title="March  1, 2012  6:04AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 1, 2012 9:00AM by Todd_L.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            an excellent analysis, which was posted elsewhere:<br/><br/><br/><span style="color: #3333FF;">Time to fire up the DeRonDonizer...<br/><br/>I have met dozens, perhaps over a hundred very experienced role-players with this profile<br/><br/><i>"I have met many gamers whom I imagine are like this."</i><br/><br/>a limited repertoire of games behind him<br/><br/><i>"They play D&amp;D"</i><br/><br/>and extremely defensive and turtle-like play tactics.<br/><br/><i>"They play to keep their character alive and 'win' rather than create interesting / tragic narratives via their character"</i><br/><br/>Ask for a character background, and he resists, or if he gives you one, he never makes use of it or responds to cues about it.<br/><br/><i>"The player is more interested in the game and less interested in using the game to create a compelling narrative."</i><br/><br/>Ask for actions - he hunkers down and does nothing unless there's a totally unambiguous lead to follow or a foe to fight.

While I understand That Guy has a somewhat limited breadth of games we are talking about his playing story games (namely the people we mostly play with).  I think part of the equation is in the rules (clearly since it was mentioned in game theory circles).  Too many games don't address player roles.  So while, yes, it's the GMs responsibility to convey what the player's role is it's also up to the game to make it clear.<br/><br/>Different games seek to represent different experiences so to not be clear about those ideas in the game text is to lead a player astray.  And while that would seem to say that EVERY game would say "bring the fun to the table," quite honestly that is not the agenda of every game.  Sometimes turtling is the correct reaction to the rules and challenges presented to players.  If it's clear to them that they gain advantage by passive action and the GM is going to bring action to them it's hardly the players responsibility to be proactive.<br/><br/>A good deal of games fail at this, especially convention games.  They have reward economies that support hoarding and don't give the players any direction.  Solid games will help the players (GM included, of course) navigate these issues far more reliably than games that run on gaming zeitgeist.  While many of us may pride ourselves on being proactive, fun players, everyone isn't going to play with us and we get frustrated when we meet that person and don't know how to engage them.<br/><br/>I say make it part of social contract.  Let the rules do the heavy lifting (and the designer in absentia).  Personally I'd prefer to "hide" behind the rules and say "hey, says here the players need to bring the fun to the table and feed the other player ideas on how to engage them."  <br/><br/>This may be a spinoff of my argument but a big part of this for me is that while part of the equation is "how do we entertain him and makes this fun" I also thing every player has a responsibility to make the game fun for everyone involved.  Emily, Eppy and I had a conversation about this point.  I've played a number of very competitive CCGs where good sportsmanship - everyone is having fun and feels valued - are a part of the tourney rules and are rewarded.  If you can do it explicitly in CCGs you certainly should be able to do it at an RPG table.  <br/><br/>- Don                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15977/have-you-ever-met-this-guy/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15977/have-you-ever-met-this-guy">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15977/have-you-ever-met-this-guy/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15977/have-you-ever-met-this-guy/p3">3</a><a class=" p-4 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15977/have-you-ever-met-this-guy/p4" rel="next">4</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15977/have-you-ever-met-this-guy/p4" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F15977%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F15977%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Have you ever met this guy? - Page 4 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15977/have-you-ever-met-this-guy/p4" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Have you ever met this guy? - Page 4" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15977/have-you-ever-met-this-guy/p4" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="We have (had?) a nickname for that kind of players (&quot;La plante verte&quot;).

class="Message">\n                            We have (had?) a nickname for that kind of players ("La plante verte"). I don't think I ever ran a public table without one.<br/><br/> In my experience, that general attitude hides several different, sometimes overlapping, profiles:<br/><br/>- As noted before, there's the player who's only here for the social gathering, the game being a convenient excuse like any other. I see no point in begrudging that kind of fun. The worse I've had to suffer from those is chatter interrupting the action, and that's an easy to solve problem (I would even go as far as to say it's a positive thing, depending on how/when it happens).<br/><br/>- There's what I call the nostalgic one. Had a really great campaign once and is trying to catch the lightning again, but never quite gets there - and probably won't, the conditions just changed too much. I've often had a problem dealing with those... I *know* they're not really having fun, I don't think the group can provide the almost mystical experience they're wishing for, yet I cant' find it in me to ask them to try another table - all I can muster is a warning that things probably won't be what they expect.<br/><br/>- There's the "shy" player, the one that hates the spotlight and is perfectly satisfied with having very little to do with the meat of the action. One of my friends, Kim, could spend a whole session without rolling - even when I specifically tailored scenes for him. He also took extensive notes and drew everything out - I'm still trying to get hold of that moleskin travelogue he did for our Runequest: Slayers game, the charcoal pieces - and then later added aquarelles - were beautiful), and his characters were also quite often the only *grounded* ones; he was often supplying the infrastructure that allowed other characters to work. All in all, he was happy playing a secondary character to the other player's protagonists. Again, I don't see any reason to begrudge that kind of fun.<br/><br/>- There's the player who only enjoys some bits of the game (whether it's the tactical aspect, or combat, or relationship-drama) and is perfectly willing to wait for his turn while other people have their own brand of fun. My friend Tristan can spend a whole game without talking... when he does though it generally happens to be memorable. We discussed this, and his take his that  everyone around the table has fun for different reasons, and he's enjoying himself enough for his taste - not to mention, quoth he "enjoy(s) other player's enjoyment".<br/>\n<blockquote>He engaged with the system, worked the resources, added great stuff to the fiction and generally "won" Capes. And he bitched about it the whole time and hated every minute of it. It was insane!</blockquote>\nI've had that kind of players from time to time, and to me they're a much bigger problem, I find. Not only can they almost monopolize the spotlight, they don't enjoy themselves while doing so, and spoil the whole mood at the table at the same time.<br/><br/>There was that kid who used to hang out in the local RPG club... we nicknamed him the "system-eater". He wasn't so much RPGing as playing a game by proxy against the game-makers to see how he could break their systems. He was a really good role-player, always active, almost always "winning"... but I don't think I've ever seen him enjoying himself - as he himself said, though he loved the idea of RPGs in theory, he was still looking for the "right game". I don't think he ever found it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus" title="nikodemus"><img alt="nikodemus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus">nikodemus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364175/#Comment_364175" name="Item_152" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T08:42:24+00:00" title="March  1, 2012  8:42AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 1, 2012 8:44AM by nikodemus.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite><br/>Yeah, but she won't avoid anything (or rather, she'll avoid everything).

Difference between public and private games.  I had That Guy at my table for a full arch of PTA at a home game.  It wasn't that he wasn't trying (in this case).  I think he was more the awkward type and was just out of his depth with gregarious, imaginative Type-A personalities.  I considered taking him in and making him more a part of our social circles and try and "help" him out of his shell, maybe just be more comfortable in social situations.  I ended up deciding that was offensive and belittling to him and who was I to think he needed improvement.  I opted to just chalk it up to different play styles and didn't invite him to further games.<br/><br/>- Don                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364196/#Comment_364196" name="Item_156" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T09:17:14+00:00" title="March  1, 2012  9:17AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 1, 2012 9:17AM by Hans_c-o.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zak S</cite>Why don't you take the people you<i>do</i>want to play with and invite them to come play at your place?</blockquote>\nI <i>do</i> do this!

(Take that term with whatever amount of salt is necessary. I'm myself pretty careful about categorising real people as somehow of a lesser caste of gamer, as most of the time matters of taste or lack of experience are much more important than skill or natural ability.) If you want to have a public club or you want to contribute to a public convention, then it pretty much comes with the territory that you can't resolve the challenges of play by swapping in your personal A-team where the quality of player leaves something to be desired. Admittedly a public gaming club is difficult in this regard because it mixes two motivations: on the one hand you want to be public for outreach purposes, but on the other you'd like to have a pleasant evening every week with gaming and friends, considering that you're doing it regularly. Getting by with a second string player is more difficult to justify when you have to do it every week and not just as a social cost of doing outreach.<br/><br/>I myself have a long history of hosting pretty open and socially egalitarian games. As many here know, this often means that the groups form on social basis more than artistic (people bring their boy/girlfriends, childhood friends, anybody who expresses interest), and often the gamer social environment attracts the sort of people who I call "sad" in Finnish: socially awkward, gets to play more because nobody wants to turn him away than because somebody wants him to be there. I made the choice long ago (like, a decade back) to try to work with the environment and social realities instead of hunkering down and forming my own bombshelter group with the players I'd consider best in the area. This kind of approach to the social space of gaming means that you'll grow used to dealing with all sorts of people, choosing games and techniques of play with the uneven player material in mind.<br/><br/>With that background in mind, my usual approach with the type of sad player Hans describes is to play games that are more resistant to player passivity. The goal is to achieve good play with the group despite having some dead weight along for the ride. Sometimes such players become permanent fixtures (permanent for teenagers, anyway - three years until their life changes and they move to somewhere else, for example), other times they don't really penetrate the group socially and appear less in sessions because nobody told them that it's on, or because they themselves decided that it's not for them (or just maybe because somebody else told them that they're not wanted - it's not like I'm the only active participant in these circles). Where such players stick around I don't have great hopes about improvement - I used to, but the last decade has demonstrated to me that people tend to have the sort of nature they have, and it's something that changes only rarely. Sometimes you get an awkward introvert player who grows into a decisive and compelling social presence when he gets a chance to hang out with people for extended periods for the first time in his life. Most of the time the social benefit is limited to providing one of the Earth's quieter creatures with some social contacts and creative encouragement in the formative years of their life. I don't consider that latter arc a massive failure: shy and socially inept people also have a worth, and even if they never get become exactly compelling companionship or brilliant gamers, they'll become something else, utilizing what they've learned about the world during their time with you.<br/><br/>(The above sounds like I run a youth club and not a gaming group. I've found that the two are not incompatible given sufficient clarity of purpose, gaming skill and patience.)<br/><br/>Sometimes I do have more specific artistic needs, and I form a temporary "private" group for that purpose. Basically call suitable players who I know will like that sort of game. So it's not an unknown need for me to want to play something in an emotionally secure, high-skill company. Playtests, for example, often require this in the early stages.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364211/#Comment_364211" name="Item_158" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T10:14:39+00:00" title="March  1, 2012 10:14AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>If you want to have a public club or you want to contribute to a public convention, then it pretty much comes with the territory that you can't resolve the challenges of play by swapping in your personal A-team where the quality of player leaves something to be desired</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite><br/>With that background in mind, my usual approach with the type of sad player Hans describes is to play games that are more resistant to player passivity.</blockquote>\nThese are good thoughts.

You can be nice to people, or run a competitive outfit (in whatever sense a given gamer might interpret that), but not both at the same time. I do my "year's best sessions" (as they're ironically marketed in the Finnish scene) at conventions where I can pre-arrange for my A-team to come from the different parts of the country, while my house game is open to newcomers and so on - although of course we strive for as high a quality as we can there as well, and do achieve notable heights now and then. (This is especially true when you realize that your own perception of who it's good to play with is not perfect - I'd say that my current house game beats my average convention sessions 10-0, despite the fact that I know many roleplayers who I'd term "better" than average who I only ever get to play with at conventions. There's more to success than raw talent.)<br/><br/>Of course, one could always make a roleplaying club semi-private. I've never seen such a thing, but most gentlemen's clubs and such are, indeed, only joined by invitation from existing membership. That is a good solution if you want to maintain a "player pool" without committing to only playing with the same people all the time, and want to maintain the quality of participation. My understanding is that most player pools (loose social networks of gamers, that is) work on this basis to a degree, although I've only heard of isolated gaming <i>groups</i> have formal steps of induction. Having your club be "invitation only" might sound a tad too prissy for many, of course, even if this is what many people probably secretly desire or work to achieve without quite saying it in these terms. (This is especially true here in Finland; a roleplaying club is usually couched in terms of cultural activism here, people wouldn't expect such a club to be insular in nature.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364251/#Comment_364251" name="Item_160" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T11:50:09+00:00" title="March  1, 2012 11:50AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, Eero, my local group does just that, though probably not in as concrete of terms as an actual club.

How do you get into the FB group? As you say, it sounds like a halfway formalized social network.<br/><br/>12 people is still about an extended gaming group for me - that's about how many people you seem to get when a bunch of gamers spend several years starting up games and gathering people for them. I mean, I've got a similar set-up myself in Helsinki from when I lived there: we have a mailing list of about a dozen people who arrange sessions and campaigns with each other. I originally started the list on 2003 or so to deal with campaign issues, and once the campaign ended, the people who'd participated in that campaign from time to time continued using it to organize. Nowadays it's 1-2 concrete campaigns that are usually run at the same time from this group, but I wouldn't still term it a gaming club: it's just a bunch of friends who form a gaming group that sometimes plays with slightly different makeups than others. For it to be a club I'd expect it to have a bit more people, or something.<br/><br/>Hmm, perhaps a sociological terminology is in order:<br/><b>A group</b> - people who play specifically together, either for now or permanently. Usually no more than half a dozen people.<br/><b>A network</b> - about 10-20 gamers who know each other and organize groups from amongst themselves. It seems to me that the gamers who are part of a local network like this treat gaming in a radically different manner than the ones who only have a single group: when you've got a network, you have much more latitude on what to play, because you can have people self-select into the games they like. Single-grouped people you sometimes encounter (I was one in my teens) have to limit themselves to what the group concensus can stomach.<br/><b>A club</b> - a social outreach effort for gamers. This might be an outlier experience, but when I was part of the University of Helsinki rpg club, the social networks and the club itself were separate things. I got to know many gamers in Helsinki, but the club was just... I don't know, really, I guess it was sort of a gathering place for new college student gamers where they could find each other and form social ties that'd enable them to form gaming groups now that they'd moved to the city and out of their previous circles.
