That's not useful, except to tell us that it's easier than hard but harder than easy.<br/><br/>I'd rather look at what's at stake, and how much a person is willing to risk. Making an attack against a monster in D&amp;D could have a 30-40% chance of success and still be considered "routine": after all, the player and character lose nothing (theoretically speaking, anyway) by making an attack, and will probably have many, many opportunities to try again.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if I'm the pilot of our plane or spacecraft, and I have to make a Piloting roll to land the craft safely, I'd consider a 90% chance of success absolutely brutal odds.

At any given moment, with most things, we can either do them or we can't.<br/><br/>Here are the four things I can come up with that I might ever call "medium difficulty" in real life:<br/>1) A skill that looks like it will take me personally a "medium" amount of time to learn.<br/>2) A completely new thing I've never tried to do, for which I estimate a "medium" likelihood that I'd be able to do it.  An actual attempt will then resolve this guess into a reality of "yes I can" or "no I can't", so the "difficulty" is purely imaginary.<br/>3) A task that is doable by a "medium" number of people in the context in question.<br/>4) A "medium" balance of factors hindering and aiding a task.<br/><br/>Note that (3) and (4) still probably leave any individual's odds of success at that task near 0% or 100%.<br/><br/>If we're interested in looking <i>only</i> at the tasks people perform at the very edge of their trained ability (I can <i>always</i> throw a frisbee 73 yards unless there's a fluke slip, and I can <i>never</i> throw it 87 yards unless there's a fluke wind gust, but <i>80 yards is a maybe</i>), then, subjectively, I think the sensible labels would be:<br/><br/>Very difficult - 80% success<br/>Incredibly difficult - 40% success<br/>Nearly impossible - 5% success<br/><br/>If it was anything less than "very difficult", and you've put the time in, you could just <i>do</i> it, right?

Probably, "moderately challenging yet doable" would be a good description for my personal flavor of "medium". I also like 2097's definition:<br/>"What's a good percent of success to use most often, as a baseline, for an interesting chance, in a game?" <br/><br/>AsIf: to "medium for whom?" - well, for you personally. i.e. you could say "for pulp setting, I'd consider X% medium; for cthuloid setting Y%.".<br/><br/>Veav: thanks. I'm counting the percentage the other way round, and I get the idea.<br/><br/>David_Berg: thanks for your precise answer. I had something like "2A" in mind, indeed.<br/><br/>Rickard: thanks for the link.

"<br/><br/>2097/Rafu/Rickard: <br/>To me the three Cortex Plus systems (Dramatic/Heroic/Action Roleplaying) are a very good example of how dice mechanics _can_ make a difference and support the setting. Of course, for most settings/games, the underlying dice mechanics are probably exchangeable.<br/>I also agree that it's more important to have a good "steering wheel" and not the "perfect dice scale".<br/>Still, my main problem with dice pools is that probability distribution is often arbitrary and doesn't scale well for various dice pool mechanics (no. of dice, highest/lowest of, rerolls...). While they are kind of fun, I'm often left with a feeling that I might as well play dice-less freeform, kind of.<br/><br/>Adam_Dray: We don't play baseball in Europe, sorry I can't relate to that ;-) <br/>Shooting a basket from a three-point-line would be probably something I'd consider "difficult" for a pro, a two-pointer something of a "medium" difficulty. Sort of.<br/><br/>Overall, to give typical situation would be i.e. a "challenging yet not life threatening task/encounter in a D&amp;D setting". It's interesting to see that some also perceive a certain "sweet spot" around 60-65% (success) as a base difficulty (and for some this doesn't apply this way).<br/>As I've said I've gone through some of my favorite and some popular RPGs. Most of them implicitly or explicitly state an average or medium difficulty, I've calculated them as:<br/>50% 61,73% 64,88% 85% (72,22%) 52,5% 55% 50% 62,5% 39,6%<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441500/#Comment_441500" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-14T19:08:50+00:00" title="January 14, 2015  7:08PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's that low one?

I'm not sure I like the actual numbers on it, but the concept is very much heading in the right direction. Good stuff.<br/><br/>As an irrelevant aside, I find your commentary on dice pools bizarre and surprising. If the dice pool isn't presenting a good probability curve for your game... your game is very poorly designed, in my opinion. I'm sure there are some games like this out there, but... yuck. It's certainly possible to design a very nice dice pool mechanic (and, at least for me, that's the only reason to use one - to get odds you can't easily get with a simple die roll). [One way I like to use this is to make up ways in which the odds of success grow or shrink at different rates than the odds of failure. For example, there might be a way you can increase your chances of success while simultaneously making a disastrous failure more likely.]<br/><br/>As another irrelevant aside, it's funny to see the term "Average" from FATE mentioned here. They took the adjective scale from Fudge and added the term "Average" to it. I always felt that this was an error, for a variety of reasons (not just aesthetically, but also with how it messes with the size of the steps in the scale). I much prefer the original Fudge scale, without the problematic "Average" term.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441515/#Comment_441515" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-15T02:55:08+00:00" title="January 15, 2015  2:55AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 15, 2015 2:56AM by David_Berg.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looks sensible from a meta-perspective.

Can you explain what you mean about FU? How does the distribution not match intuitive estimation? Are you talking about a player's intuitive estimation (i.e. estimating the odds of a success mathematically - you'd <i>think</i> roll X dice gives you good odds, but math reveals that it doesn't) or a character's-perspective intuitive estimation ("I'm a good skier, so I should be able to make this!" -&gt; Whereas, the way it actually works out, a "good" skier fails most of the time)?<br/><br/>I agree with you on the Fudge/Fate issue. My main issue with "Average" (aside from it being a meaningless term, for the kinds of things they're using the ladder to rate in Fate) is that it "expands" the middle of the range, making it even harder for low-rating characters to achieve results or compete with higher-skill characters. It is also means higher-skill characters suffer "poor" results less often, substituting "Average" results more often. Finally, it means even more results fall into that ambiguous "Mediocre/Average/Fair" area for everyone, which isn't really descriptively helpful. <br/><br/>Doesn't seem like the best design choice, to me. I'm guessing they needed an extra step in the ladder to make some of the math work out, so they threw that one in. Would have been more fun to add it at the top end, I think, but that's just me!<br/><br/>(Of course, it works for the game as written anyway. It's not a huge point, just something that stuck out to me.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441635/#Comment_441635" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-18T09:12:14+00:00" title="January 18, 2015  9:12AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 18, 2015 9:12AM by AsIf.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            N.B. for whom it may concern: Although it's tempting to consider the 7-9 range in AW as being the most likely due to our well-drilled acknowledgment of the 7 as the apex of the 2-12 bell curve, that range spans only 3 numbers, which narrows its likelihood to <i>exactly the same as the failure range</i> which spans 5 numbers (note this is without modifiers):<pre>2-6     41.67%<br/>7-9     41.67%<br/>10-12   16.67%</pre>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441647/#Comment_441647" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-18T17:59:20+00:00" title="January 18, 2015  5:59PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's true. A 7-9 is the most common outcome *only* for a character with a stat of +1 (at 0, it is tied with a miss, and at +2 it is tied with a 10+).<br/><br/>+1 <i>is</i> the average stat score for an AW character, but if we take an average of the odds for any given roll assuming an even spread of scores from -2 to +3, or the average of the odds for any given roll assuming an even spread of scores from -1 to +2, the cumulative odds for failure and a 7-9 are pretty similar (36% for a miss, compared to 40% for a 7-9).<br/><br/>However, given this conversation and character success, it's interesting to note how we parse these results *emotionally*: yes, often the odds of a failure are as common or more common than the odds of a 7-9, but in our mind we lump the 7-9 hit in with the 10+, since both are character successes. That makes misses seem rare in comparison. (Even for the character with a stat of 0 - which doesn't get rolled as often as stats of +1, +2, and even +3, in my experience - the odds of a failure, at 42%, are less than that of any success at all, which is in the 58-59% range.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
