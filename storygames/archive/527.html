<p>So, lots of games do a lot of work to present you with these bits and pieces of their settings that aren't useful at all to me. I'm gonna use Exalted as an example because it's got a setting I know a little about. But the question applies more broadly.</p>
<p>If I flip to a randomly selected page of the setting section, I find dreary facts, the sort that you would discover in a third-rate self-guided tour book: climate, predominant crops and trade goods, the appearance of inhabitants, distinctive details of dress, and so forth. It paints a picture, but if you're listening to a tour guide, it's the picture that you tune out.</p>
<p>This is strongly at odds with the way it paints its characters, as a sort of confetti mess of unrelated but consistently exuberant concepts - a crippled war hero who runs his corner of the world from his rose garden; a vanished, demon-worshipping, nameless queen; a relic hunter with jewel-beaded hair, searching out the treasures of her past lives; a dragon who has gone mad and wanders the earth as a beggar, forgetting his position and power! These paint a picture I pay attention to, one with energetic people that have complicated, over-the-top lives. More importantly, these vibrant, dynamic parts are what define a setting for me. <strong>They're the bits that matter.</strong></p>
<p>What I'm uncomfortable with is that I don't have any procedures to make that second thing. I can make the first lickety-split, by just taking one such guidebook and sprinkling liberally with Asian Buzzword Seasoning (or whatever works for the setting you're in), but it's a lot harder to make characters and mood, and it's mood that I'm really after.</p>
<p>What I wanna know is, how can I give people the <em>tools</em> to build the setting that I want them to build, without actually doing it? That is, to lock down mood and color and even situation structure (this, I think we know a little more about, so please don't focus on it to the exclusion of other things), but leave the dreary details of proper nouns and defined numbers to them.</p>
<p>(This post took an unholy number of revisions. It's late. I hope I have gotten it right this time.)</p>

I don't know what to say.  Basically, a strong sense of color and a few select concrete tidbits does this excellently.<br/>
<br/>
I put a bunch of random optional pieces in the back of the book, but that's exactly because I liked writing them.<br/>

Um - why?  I mean, you can give people examples (lots of examples) of the sort of mood and color that you're looking for ... but other than that, you have absolutely no control over the setting of the game unless you hard-code it into the rule structure, really.<br/><br/>But really, it seems like you're very concerned about folks playing your game (or at least the setting) 'the right way'.                        </div>

                            Shreyas, I think what you're trying to get at is the difference between evocative and factual description.  The latter tries to convey information by, well, actually conveying the information that you'll need and then making you apply that information through a process of reasoning to create a setting.  The former, rather, evokes the reader's existing knowledge, so that even if you're not giving them any additional information, you're informing them by telling them what parts of their existing knowledge to draw from.<br/><br/>(Can you tell I've been looking at role-playing from a cognitive psychology perspective?)<br/><br/>I think, then, that what you might want to try is figuring out what you want your players to be able to know about your setting, and then figure out what real-world context they'll know those things in.  If you can find ways to remind them of this - the formal term being 'evoke those schemas' - you'll be getting their whole set of associations with whatever they already know, from characters to mood to plots to, well, you name it.  Then you need to find ways to shape and guide them so that they can discard the inappropriate bits of those models, and to show them how to combine the different models that you're using.<br/><br/>This may just boil down to what Ben was saying, but hopefully some idea of <i>why</i> this works might help you figure out, concretely, what to do.<br/><br/>If you can come up with a specific example of what you want to convey, I'd be happy to kick around some concrete ideas; I have no idea how usable this notion is in the abstract.<br/><br/>Kuma:<br/><br/>Even if you hard-code your setting into the game rules, people who don't want to play the setting will hack your rules just like they'd ignore your setting.  It sounds like what Shreyas is concerned about is how to help people who <i>do</i> want to play with his setting do it without having to bore them to death in the way that many 'setting' books do.<br/><br/>Shreyas, is that right?                        </div>

                            Well, there's a big advantage to actually having done it.  I'm trying to implement these ideas in my antebellum South meets fifties suburbia meets sci-fi dystopia game, and it's harder to do than it is to describe.  It's kind of like playing Family Feud, and I was never very good at that game!  You've done it successfully, and I think that it's worth looking at what in the world you did to make it work so well.<br/><br/>I'm always in favor of a marriage between theory and practice.  Without it, theory gets sterile and practice risks becoming thoughtless.  I think that Shreyas probably has useful things to learn from us both!<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            Man, I think Vax has it a lot of it.  But that won't stop me from adding.<br/>
<br/>
To my mind, trade, climate and whatnot can be interesting, but it really requires that the writer is doing it because he thinks it's cool and fun, not because it's mandatory.  Obligatory information of any sort is gonna be boring and useless, but if you get a guy who really _digs_ economics and how they can really fuel the engine of play, then you're gonna get a good economics writeup, because it's not about how much rice the Irini's produce in a year, it's about why the rice crop leads to river Piracy in response to the tax burden, and how that's lead to a local lord hoarding rice and blaming losses on the bandits.  You can _go_ somewhere with that.<br/>
<br/>
The same thinking is gonna hit you anywhere.  I promise you that if you crap out a travel guide that you don't give a damn about, people are gonna ignore it, and instead when they get to the part that excites _you_, they're going to catch that excitement.  The Exalted text you point to is a clear demonstration of it - which of those elements are the ones that you think excited the writers?<br/>
<br/>
Now, that said, I think that even if you usually hate the guidebook portion, it's worth stopping to think of whether there's a way you _can_ make it something you care about.  <br/>
<br/>
I, for example, want more stereotypes and jokes.  Politics and economics are handy, but I swear to god, there is nothing I would love for a setting book than a page of light bulb jokes (or their equivalent) about the various nationalities and groups in a game.<br/>

                            Ohh, Vax, nice.<br/><br/>I've got this one Japanese RPG (called "Shanghai Noir", takes place in a "Deadlands" style fictional stuff happening in early 1900s Shanghai), where all the major setting NPCs (18 of them, IIRC) were written down hard on every single character sheet: It was the player's job to choose a few that they know, and what their relationship was to them (it was simple: Positive, Negative, etc).  I think combining this with Vax's stuff, plus perhaps something like the relationship mechanics from Weapons of the Gods, you'd have a powerful tool for creating "People-Setting".<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

<p>Thanks, guys. I'm going to try and address your points in order, and then synthesize.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT GAR CROSSPOST I'll mull on those additional reponses.</strong></p>
<p>Drew,</p>
<p>Dogs actually came to mind when I was writing this post; I don't mean to dismiss your suggestion, because it's a good one, but I have deep-seated emotional reasons (irrelevant to this thread) about why I'd rather not discuss that game.</p>
<p>Ben,</p>
<p>Ben, you suggest the method you used in <em>Polaris,</em> and I have seen it work, <em>for players who're good at mimicry.</em> I wonder, what would you have done differently if you had seen a need for stronger setting support, for non-mimic players?</p>
<p>Kuma,</p>
<p>I <em>absolutely do</em> want to hard-code the setting. It's very important to me that I give players all the tools they need to play a game right (i.e. "so that it works"), and that means that I'm responsible for encapsulating my knowledge in a useful form; I wouldn't want to write a Japan game that only works as intended when played by Japanophiles. That'd be irresponsible of me.</p>
<p>So I tend to believe that a strong framework of rules and processes is the best way to do this, because it's robust to detail alteration, <em>and</em> it doesn't rely on the players' pattern-recognition abilities. Does that answer your "why" question?</p>
<p>You're right that I'm very concerned about people playing the game the right way, and I'd like to know more about your stance on that. Why the scarequotes?</p>
<p>Jessica,</p>
<p>You are saying something excellent! Thanks. You're right that I do want to give already-engaged players actively interesting support; I also want to avoid turning off setting-averse players like me, by making the setting into a more Shreyas-friendly thing that I can't quite name yet.</p>
<p>So, first, you asked for an example - let's take mythological Polynesia. I don't know this place from a cat's behind, so I'm not gonna get myself all silly-looking telling facts about it, but I know how I want it to play - There's lots and lots of water, but a sense of "it's just over there", a sort of vacation effect since we are temperate people telling stories about Paradise, and a tangible awareness of the odd spiritual forces that run under the world. The characters here are scions and treasures of the people. So I guess the first thing I ask you is, how do I point players at the knowledge that'll spit this out?</p>
<p>And now, here's the tough nut to crack: Without <em>giving</em> players knowledge, how can I stop relying on their knowledge? I guess that's a roundabout way of saying, "I have these schemas and I don't want to endanger people who don't; can I build them into a game in a structural rather than declarative way?"</p>

<i>I guess that's a roundabout way of saying, "I have these schemas and I don't want to endanger people who don't; can I build them into a game in a structural rather than declarative way?"</i><br/><br/>In one sense, I'm not sure you can. And I'm not sure you need to.<br/><br/>An example from my own experience:<br/><br/>I kinda like the idea of a Japanese culture oriented game. I think it would be cool. I also have steadfastly avoided trying to run such because I don't think I could do it justice because I don't know enough about that culture. And here's the kicker - if I <b>really</b> was interested in that culture, and running a game in it, I'd go out and learn about the culture. I've certainly done research to learn about other kinds of stuff for gaming before. So basically my thought is that if the <b>only</b> thing that's getting the potential players of your game psyched about the schemas is your game itself, and the existence of a cool sounding game doesn't entice the players to expand their knowledge, then you really have no hope of teaching the players those schemas.<br/><br/>Of course one thing also to make sure you don't discount is the possibility that the schemas are more generic than you realize. I'm not really that much into Westerns, but I was not the least bit intimidated to run Dogs, but Dogs is also the only game that accesses a Western schema that I've really felt comfortable with. And I think it's because it actually depends on some pretty universal schemas (like the soap opera schema, as one of my players observed).<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>

<p>Fred, JD,</p>
<p>I find it amusing how you guys counterpointed each other up there.</p>
<p>Fred,</p>
<p>I don't want to dismiss your response (it's a valuable thing for crap-settings, and I wish that crap-setting would do it (please everyone realise that I'm using "crap" to mean "full of facts") ), but see what you're doing? You're saying, "Well you don't like Crap X, here's some Crap Y." But I'm trying to leave the crap <em>store</em> and go to the crap <em>factory.</em></p>
<p>Same goes for Rob.</p>
<p>I want digestive systems, not tastier crap!</p>
<p>Andy,</p>
<p>You reminded me of something about WotG that maybe I'll call your attention to later.</p>
<p>Frank,</p>
<p>This is what I'm trying to fix! I want <em>you</em> to feel like it's not <em>your</em> responsibility to do justice to (thing X), because the system will guarantee it!</p>
<p>Similarly, if I can hard-code (thing X), then I can slip it by you and you might not even notice, which appeals to the control-freak aspect of my game design urge.</p>
<p>I'd be interested to hear more about why you think this thing impossible, but I'd like to stifle "you don't need it" for now, if you don't mind. Let's just say that, for the sake of discussion, I <em>do</em> need it; what's gonna stop me?</p>

                            Frank may be right about your schemas being more accessible than you think, but if not--<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me the basic way to build in structure is to have it be implicit in the descriptions and action of play.  Provide some vignettes that illustrate the strucuture without making it apparent--players will go to work to make sense of it.<br/>
<br/>
For your pseudo-polynesia: imagine a scene.  Say, a village burning to the ground, man, woman, and child running madly here and there.  There is a man ignoring all this, running straight into a burning building and emerging with smoke stained bits of bone and wood covered in strange pictiograms.  The villagers around him look to him with relief, shout cheers of approval, as he flees the village, leaving the rest to fend for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what's going on, but I know there is something meaningful happening.  My efforts to make sense of that (with some input from the GM) will get me a schema without having it laid out in a dry (if this happens, then you do this) way.<br/>
<br/>
Better yet, have the players take on the role of the man, let them try to save some people and have them react with horror, slapping them, trying to get away, yelling about the relics needing to be saved.<br/>
<br/>
A related question: are you trying to hack an existing system (like Exalted) or creating a system from scratch?  If the latter, you can probably do some very pro-active things to get the system and evocative elements hard-wired so players come across them quickly.<br/>
<br/>
This isn't quite the crap factory, but it seems to be on the road towards it.                        </div>

<p>Ian, I need to think about what you said. I'm talking in context of designing games whole-cloth, for starters, but a better response later.</p>
<p>Fred, that's insightful; it feels right. That means that in the perfect case, setting happens as an incidental consequence of more important play, but, putting that aside... are you leading up to something? I'd be interested to hear it.</p>

                            Yeah, I am, because in some games, creating setting is part of play.<br/>
<br/>
Conquer the Horizon is a good example.<br/>
<br/>
The game I'm working on, on and off (Violence Sex Family Money God Art), takes that idea further, and makes setting-creation an action that a player can take at any time.<br/>

                            I like the idea of things in the setting that happen that you can't ignore, that you have to respond to. But there's a downside to this if it's not timed properly. My players don't get comfortable in a setting until they've played in it for a few sessions - sometimes several sessions. If I start throwing in DRAMA into the setting before they have invested themselves in it, first of all, it'll fall one hundred percent fucking flat because they don't care, and second of all, they'll even stop the process of learning to care about the setting - after all, why (how?) should they learn it if it's in a terrible and wild state of flux?                        </div>

                            JD, <br/><br/>This is a good point. I have much the same point with character drama and my players -- there has to be a slow build up and lead in, a chance to become emotionally entangled at a gut (rather than just brain) level before shit hits the fan, or else neither shit nor fan means anything to them. <br/><br/>So what I've gotten good at doing is having things moving very slowly at first, starting before the huge explosion, so that the PCs can get into it, feel it slowly starting to shift, and only have it go to the wild and crazy when they are fully engaged and ready. <br/><br/>It is, for me at least, largely a matter of pacing.<br/><br/>But then Shreyas, are you looking for that kind of game? Or something where you start out mentally engaged with the setting so that things can blow up the moment you start playing? <br/><br/>(I'm suddenly reminded of a conversation I had with Emily about Braveheart, and about how she didn't like the first part of the movie because she just wanted them to get to the conflict, while I found the first part of the movie to be the best part, and the conflict to be a little trite.)                        </div>

<p>Brand,</p>
<p>When I think about games that I have enjoyed lately, they're games where the setting does not intrude; elements spring into focus if and when they create conflict against the characters' goals or the characters deliberately seek them out.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if that answers your question directly, though. What do you think?</p>

<br/>
Yes, possible.<br/>
<br/>
One way you can do it is by providing examples -- signature characters in Exalted, segments of "setting material," examples of play.  The patterns of relationships that you establish and reinforce in the examples will be internalized by your audience and replicated with their own idiosyncratic alterations.                        </div>

                            This is a little whacky, but I started thinking about structural anthropology (Durkheim, Mauss, Levi-Strauss).  One of the core ideas there is that most societies can be understood by determining the oppositions that define them, that the oppositions create a conflict that things like stories, religion, clothing style, how you cook your food, etc. try to resolve.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if you take for granted that most rpg settings are little more than stories bulked up with fact steroids (climatology, geography, etc), could you provide players with societal conflicts?  This flies in the face of the keep situation and setting separate, with setting being a constellation of 'ur-situations' which setting mediates.  In other words, you establish setting-specific obsessions that in play and character creation get developed in certain ways.<br/>
<br/>
In structural anthropology (esp. Levi-Strauss) the tension emerges because the opposition can't be resolved conceptually but that doesn't stop people from trying and asserting to the contrary.  So, maybe imagine somethin like this for setting creation:<br/>
<br/>
1. Select set of oppositions (law v. chaos, sun v. moon, dirty v. clean, dry v. sticky, etc)<br/>
2. Correlate oppositions (law and moon v. sun and chaos, etc; don't end up with just two sides but a set of two sided correlations)<br/>
3. Select mediation zones (clothing, war, hut building, travel, etc.)<br/>
4. Provide sample mediations (different sorts of legal business associated with different phases of the moon, warfare carried out in light of day, law at night, twilight seen as dangerous time, when law and chaos meet, law seen as something to be carried out in secret)<br/>
5.  Encourage players to work with sample mediations, allowing mechanical elements to do so--some way to 'invoke' the setting by way of the oppositions (a simple-minded example: it is night time and players 'invokes' the lawfulness of the night to add dice to their roll to apprehend the man who killed a child; allow them to narrate why this is so--i.e. "our elder gives us a holy whomping stick to bring justice" or "the moon follows the killer, a silent accuser, and sows guilt in the guilty") (another imagined invocation by players wearied by a long hunt: "those who travel by night do so in justice's name, and so rest houses dot the landscape, giving succor to we who right the wrongs")  <br/>
<br/>
I feel like I can go on and on, which makes me wonder if this might be a nifty little trick.                        </div>

</div></blockquote>
<p>This seems twice as hard because there's defining the relationships between setting-things, then building setting-things into that framework, two challenging tasks. But here's what comes to mind. (Tell me if I'm getting close.)</p>
<p>First, let's define relationships between setting things, in abstracted terms. Let's pretend the only things that matter to our setting are Justice and Fairness. Maybe we need things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>an impossible, potentially religious ideal of fairness</li>
<li>a logical, academic sense of justice</li>
<li>a real-world backdrop of justice as implemented</li>
<li>two corruptions of said backdrop, one internal and one external<br/>
** the internal one must come from the opposite of the fairness ideal<br/>
** the external one must comlement the extreme of the fairness ideal</li>
<li>both must interface into sets of guidelines and lines of duty, from the larger community into the family<br/>
** these must contradict each other</li>
</ul>
<p>So this is part of a map. Now let's provide some core seeds into the setting, maybe like group activities to fill in the blanks to help build things out. So perhaps like these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fill in the parens: "There is a terrible (accident). Many people are unable to help, and (innocent party) is in grave danger. A person of (which of the above affiliatons?) is able to intercede and save this person; however, this draws the ire of (a member) of (which of the above affiliations?)."</li>
<li>Choose one: "Between the internal corruption and external corruption, there is a covert alliance / overt alliance / morbid history / glorious history / brewing potential."</li>
</ul>
<p>And then, filling in more setting-things into the framework. Quick version: everyone gets a pool of Setting-Thing points, and they buy factions and elements and histories into the game, and it is cheaper to buy a fact into a node that is supported by more of the relationships we've clarified.</p>
<p>Add color, bake, and you're done! Except maybe Shreyas came up something that looks like the Wuxia Champions, where as I've come up with something more Gunslingers in the West. But, aside from color in itself, it's quite likely that our settings are pushing the same core aesthetic drive.</p>

                            Sorry - I just finished observing the first days of Passover, which is why I didn't respond to this earlier.  In my absence, a lot of smart people have said smart things, particularly Isbo and Vaxalon.  So, uh, you'll pardon me if I say things that are not nearly as cool.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Shreyas asked:<br/><br/><code>So, first, you asked for an example - let's take mythological Polynesia. I don't know this place from a cat's behind, so I'm not gonna get myself all silly-looking telling facts about it, but I know how I want it to play - There's lots and lots of water, but a sense of "it's just over there", a sort of vacation effect since we are temperate people telling stories about Paradise, and a tangible awareness of the odd spiritual forces that run under the world. The characters here are scions and treasures of the people. So I guess the first thing I ask you is, how do I point players at the knowledge that'll spit this out?<br/><br/>And now, here's the tough nut to crack: Without giving players knowledge, how can I stop relying on their knowledge? I guess that's a roundabout way of saying, "I have these schemas and I don't want to endanger people who don't; can I build them into a game in a structural rather than declarative way?"</code><br/><br/>The way I think about this is that it's like playing a backwards game of Family Feud.  You have to come up with the objects and events that will cause people to make backwards associations to a certain world and how it works.<br/><br/>For a mythical Polynesia, for example, I'd start by associating things that "seem" Polynesian to me.  Long and lazy days, jewel-like lagoons, tall palms and other lush vegetation, roughly carved stone statues, things built of natural materials, tribal structures among the islanders, complicated rituals involving naming and menstrual purity and keeping down the souls of the hunted beasts.  While I don't think those are the only things you could choose, those are the things that evoke my own Polynesia schemas, based on things like the <i>Mutiny on the Bounty</i> and my vague memories of Margaret Mead and <i>The Golden Bough</i>.  You could do an informal survey of a few people to see if you're drawing on the appropriate source material, and if you're drawing on source material that's popular enough that players could reference it either explicitly or unconsciously.<br/><br/>Then you want to arrange those things in some way that evokes the kinds of stories you want to tel.  Like Vaxalon and Isbo were suggesting, this has to do with the kinds of conflicts that you're setting up.  The "game elements" I've listed above are nothing more than static information, by themselves.  The question becomes how you can arrange these pieces of information, which evoke certain schemata, into dynamic situations which also evoke schemata.  For example, if you were going for a horror feel you could write about why the seemingly-happy inhabitants don't go out of their houses after dark, and introduce the various rituals that they use to protect themselves.  If you were going for more of an island-paradise feel, you could have the conflicts be about things like who gets to be in which ritual - conflicts which pretty clearly indicate that the scope of the necessary conflicts are pretty narrow, giving a feeling of contentment.<br/><br/>Then you can start building concrete conflicts on top of that, using the kinds of things that other people have suggested.  Modeling conflicts concretely is a good way to support players who don't have the appropriate schemata, because everyone can reason from examples.  You can use some of the principles of case-based learning to do this effectively, by providing a series of cases which slowly build up significant differences from each other.  So you might begin with two cases which are somewhat similar (such as a conflict between two PCs and a conflict between a PC and a villager, but about the same topic), then extend further examples to have one or two major elements changed in each further example.  This will allow people who can't use their schematic reasoning to use more inductive methods to figure out what you want just based on examples.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?<br/><br/>I'd try to be more specific, but unfortunately I'm in Florida and my books on cognition are in New York.  I'll see if I can find some more specific stuff for you when I get home.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

One thing that I think the "crap" does for a setting is make it more flexible. In other words, if you take your mythic Polynesian game and someone says, "I think a game of piracy and freebooting would be great in this setting" and you haven't written what the area produces or how trade is conducted, the person has to work a lot harder to get your game to do what they want. That is what I consider the primary purpose of the "travelogue" to gaming - it generalizes the setting more, makes it less focused, lets me play the game I want to play instead of the game the designer thought I should want to play.                        </div>

<br/>
Totally!  I'm waging some e-mail arguments now with some fans of an old sci-fi setting called Star*Drive.  It's a terrific example of the diarrhea-travelogue, where there's tons of material but it's all crap.  <br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, underneath the crap there's an absolutely terrific premise that is starkly, utterly relevant to today's world.  But none of the longtime fans of the setting agree, because they're lost in the shitstorm of meaningless factoids.  <br/>
<br/>
The factoids are thrown in there by the writers with zero consideration and zero follow-up, yet their presence permits the readers to ignore the major premise of the work.  In fact, their presence is so distracting that a certain super-genius (ahem!) couldn't figure out what the premise of the setting was for 7 goddamn years.<br/>
<br/>
It's a great setting, now that I can see through the nonsense--but I no longer have any patience for that school of design.                        </div>

                            Fair enough...by contrast I don't have any patience for a setting that just gives me a premise and says "oh, well, if you want to do something other than what I have TOLD YOU YOU MUST DO, then you'll have to work out the details yourself YOU BLITHERING MUNCHKIN."

<p>Thanks for your example, Jess; I think I understand what you're talking about better now.</p>
<p>Now, regarding schematic vs. inductive reasoning, can you untangle those terms for me? I'm not sure that what I think they mean is what you are using them to mean. (For my purposes, I'd like to avoid methods using the case-based learning method; it feels dangerously close to fact-diarrhea to me, and refining <em>those</em> techniques isn't what this thread is about. JD, maybe you want to start another thread on it?)</p>

                            Hey Shreyas!<br/><br/>So, schematic vs. inductive reasoning:<br/><br/>Schematic reasoning is when you reason using prior knowledge that you already bring to the game.  For example, the classic schema that's always used in cognition classes is that of "going to a restaurant."  You only have to evoke the schema in a very bare-bones way (for example, sitting down to eat, paying, and leaving) for everything else, from the presence of waiters to the etiquette of tipping, to come to the forefront of the reader's mind.<br/><br/>Inductive reasoning - a term which I'm using informally, not in the inductive vs. deductive logic sense - is when you're presenting a series of examples and asking people to reason, from those examples, about future situations.  Basically, you're presenting everything you want players to use in their reasoning in the material you provide, which makes this a lot more time-consuming than schematic reasoning but also more accessible.<br/><br/>I wouldn't throw out case-based reasoning either, though.  It can be badly done, but when it's well-done it's nothing like fact-diarrhea.  Imagine that you want to educate the person reading your game about the kinds of conflicts that you're trying to design.  You could try to evoke the kinds of conflicts using a schema that relates to real-world or media conflicts that players may be aware of (<i>Dogs</i> does this really well).  Or you could present a series of examples of different kinds of conflicts that you can have (an approach that <i>Vampire</i> often takes, where you get a list of "here's a conflict, and here's another, and here's how you might apply them in a new setting or in combination").  Or, if you took a case-based approach, you would actually use specific cases to illustrate the underlying principles of the conflicts you want to get players to introduce.  This doesn't have to mean a lot of random setting material that's thrown at you!  In fact, it means exactly the opposite.  Every single example is meant to introduce a new element, and to illustrate the ways in which players can combine and reuse those elements.  I'm not sure how clear that is, but that's the best I can do right now.<br/><br/>In other words, it's kind of like concrete examples which build on each other, but you know, you'll actually be able to find relevant research on the topic if you're searching for "case-based reasoning" rather than "um, examples and stuff."  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Really, these techniques are often at their best when used together.  I'm just trying to analyze my own process and separate out the different cognitive techniques that are relevant, in the hopes that it'll be useful to you.<br/><br/>JD: <br/><br/>Using these techniques, particularly the schema technique, can actually help you make a game more versatile with less fact-diarrhea.  What it sounds like you're trying to do is to help players reason in original ways about the setting.  ("I want to do this . . . but with PIRATES!")  A mental model or "system understanding" (not in the technical sense of role-playing system, but in the sense of how different parts of the diegetic reality function) is much more flexible in terms of original reasoning than fact-based understanding.  The presence of those facts may possibly be helpful, but it's even more helpful to be given tools which tell you how to figure out what <i>any</i> possible set of necessary facts could plausibly be.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>
