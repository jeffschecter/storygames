Mostly due to one of the regulars having started working shifts at a factory. The last two odd weeks I ran the intro mission for Colonial Marines. That\u2019s the Aliens hack of the Regiment. Which in turn is a World War Two Apocalypse World hack.<br/><br/><br/>The first time I GMd we had four players: Officer Willard, a gung-ho maniac, Sergeant Bennet, a savage\u2026 savage, Private Ericsen, a machine gun aficionado and Spark, the company Synthetic with a core programming to protect Weyland-Yutani property.<br/><br/><br/>On board the SS Banks Captain Ramirez gave them the situation. They were orbiting Greystone, a rebelling planet. Bravo Company, an outfit filled with freaks, outcasts and bad people, had been volunteered by the same captain for a top secret mission. \u201cThis is your last chance to redeem yourselves in the eyes of high command.\u201d <br/><br/><br/>A lot of mumbling along the lines of \u201cwho gives a shit about high command?\u201d erupted from the troops while Ramirez stabbed his eyes at Willard. \u201cDon\u2019t fuck this up Officer Willard!\u201d<br/><br/><br/>Then they got the particulars of the mission. They were to infiltrate and secure Epsilon base, a secret W-Y biological research facility, now lying behind enemy lines. There they would extract two scientists, a technician and as much research and samples as possible. As for intel they were shit out of luck. A couple of bad orbital photos, a front view from some construction worker\u2019s security compromising photo on facebucket, a lowres 3d geomap and incomplete construction blueprints was what they had to go by. The warfront was being pushed back towards Epsilon base so they were on a tight schedule. Oh, and they had to bring W-Y field officer Bolden with them for on the site guidance.<br/><br/><br/>Officer Willard advocated dropping straight down on the base and destroying the sentrygun tower before a quick smash and grab. Both Bolden and Spark denied him this pleasure for fear of destroying vital research/W-Y property since the sentry tower was on top of the laboratory section.<br/><br/><br/>Instead the plan was to have the dropships land their APCs in the valley and then storm up the road towards the base. Blue squad would drop by the base\u2019s helipad and attack the dormitories. Gold squad would take the garage. Red squad would lend support where needed. Then they would move on to the labs and operations.<br/><br/><br/>Dropping the APCs went smooth but soon the crap hit the fan. Gold squad led the way up the road but hit a landmine. The APC held but flipped onto the roof. Gold squad bailed out into the howling storm while Red squad bailed to cover them. No meaning in running their APC up a mine filled road. Blue squad secured some kind of large mining equipment that had not figured in any of the intel. Soon Gold and Red were advancing over the scree towards the garage in the stinging rain. Blue\u2019s leader Johnson acknowledged that they were ready to assault the dormitories and Willard gave the order. Red squad under direct leadership of the Gung-ho officer Willard led the charge towards the garage. Unfortunately a heavy machine gun parked in the corridor section between the garage and operations opened fire and they all had to hit the deck. Gold squad unleashed a full fusillade in order to pin the enemy. While they didn\u2019t pin the enemy it had the intended effect: the machinegun shifted it\u2019s aim toward Gold squad freeing Red to assault. Willard was about to put a frag grenade through the opening when Spark asked if he didn\u2019t want to use his flashbang instead. \u201cTo preserve property, sir.\u201d<br/><br/><br/>They silenced the machinegun but meanwhile Blue squad was being shot to ribbons outside the dormitories. Willard directed Bennet and Gold squad to assist Blue while Red would take the Garage. But as soon as Gold squad started over the mud of the parking lot private Hudson exploded into tiny bits. Apparently the enemy had sown anti-personnel mines as well.<br/><br/><br/>The explosion had alerted someone in the garage and the big port was slowly opening. Private Ericsen reacted instinctively and hurled a grenade inside. A boom and a buckling of the port later all they saw was smoke coming out and some erratic automatic fire. Willard himself led the charge inside and the quickly had the enemy pinned by suppressive fire behind supply crates in the corner.<br/><br/><br/>Wasting no time Willard and Spark flanked the enemy and finished them all off, execution style with their sidearms. Spark thought that it would be the least damaging mode of preserving property. Willard simply had his blood up. Bolden arrived after them and simply raised an eyebrow. \u201cNormally officers stay in the APC and guide their underlings via video, Officer Willard\u201d he remarked.<br/><br/><br/>But they were cut off by requests for support from Blue squad. \u201cWe\u2019ve suffered heavy losses\u201d Johnson reported. \u201cOperative strength is down to two men and three walking wounded, sir!\u201d<br/><br/><br/>And that was were we had to finish the first session. The second session had them searching the base and battling off a couple of horrible bio-weapons, accruing scars and losing a lot of grunts in the process. There were some close calls showing off the lethality of the system nicely.<br/><br/>Willard avoided court marshal inquiry by keeping losses at 29% (33% deemed by the players to be the mark) and only loosing one APC.<br/><br/><br/>Feedback on the Regiment: <br/><br/>Everybody liked the system. It was simple enough to get right into playing yet still offering tactical decisions that really mattered in the fiction. Willard\u2019s player loved the fact that he gained experience for ordering people into dangerous situations and Ericsen\u2019s that he got exp for following the same orders. Spark\u2019s player enjoyed the core directive mechanic. They all agreed that a medic would have been a real asset.<br/><br/>Everybody loved the finishing touch with the letter home.<br/><br/>All in all a real fun experience but a bit marred by the fact that no-one\u2019s surprised by the aliens and me as an GM being not so versed in military RPGing.<br/><br/>Edit: Everybody thought the VOF table should have numbers on both axles and turn the left axle upside down using the numbers (from bottom to top) -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. That would have made it much easier to read in a glance. And to use. Decreasing VOF going up the table isn't really intuitive.
