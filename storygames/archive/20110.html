Now the problem:<br/><br/>Though the book itself will be a single pdf of a fairly decent length, we have it internally divided into four main sections as a kind of concentric game design. The first contains core rules, the second contains the meat of more advanced systems - melee and ranged combat, wounds and so forth. The third contains both optional rules and the parts of the system that people tend to reference, rather than internalize (fall damage, bulk/encumbrance, and so forth), and the final section contains the chapters relevant to the GM as well as general advice on running the game. <br/><br/>Right now, they are listed as Book I, Book II, Book III, Book IV. This works, in a way.. but as the whole thing is a single document (and would be printed as a single volume) the above naming convention is misleading at first blush. On the other hand, I haven't been able to figure out anything better thus far. <br/><br/>As the line goes "There are only three problems in programming: Naming things, and off-by-one errors."<br/><br/>If anyone has any thoughts or ideas, I'd be grateful. <br/><br/>As a secondary consideration, I've been playing with the idea of laying out (and possibly producing) the game in 6x9 (trade hardback) instead of the standard "big book" 8.5x11. I feel like this will be handy for a number of reasons. The smaller book size means everything is easier to read on mobile devices (extremely handy for a pdf), a physical copy will be take up less space at the table and be easier to thumb through. You can print it out two to a page on a home printer and still be legible, or view it two pages at a time on a normal monitor. Comfortably takes up a half-screen on pdf if you're multi-tasking. The size factor has a lot to say for it. On the other hand, it lacks the .. <i>authority</i> of a more classic sized RPG book, and does leave less real estate for art, borders, or other "production value" components. We're formatting for an open beta now, but that will be a more weighty consideration when we go to print properly. <br/><br/>Let me know what you think. <br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444252/#Comment_444252" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-18T22:09:23+00:00" title="March 18, 2015 10:09PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2015 10:10PM by AsIf.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you considered splitting it into two books?<br/><br/>I'm in a similar situation, and ultimately decided to do DayTrippers that way.  The "Core" book (based on the opensource development that happened right here at SG) contains all the stuff Players need to know, and the GM Guide, well, that's obvs.  Part of my reasoning is that multiple copies of the Core book might be in existence at the table, or could be passed around for Players to consult, while only the GM needed to look at the GM stuff. This gets into trad/OSR "auteur GM" philosophy and I don't want to derail your thread, but FYI that's part of my reasoning as well.<br/><br/>Your Books I and III look like Player stuff to me, and Books II and IV look like GM stuff.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jacksonmalloy" title="jacksonmalloy"><img alt="jacksonmalloy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/618/nNDI3IZ5905UU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jacksonmalloy">jacksonmalloy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444255/#Comment_444255" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-18T22:15:14+00:00" title="March 18, 2015 10:15PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've considered splitting it (especially if our GM section keeps growing), but uncertain of how the actual printing / publishing process would go, I'd be nervous about asking people to buy two different pdfs or two separate books.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444268/#Comment_444268" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-19T05:00:32+00:00" title="March 19, 2015  5:00AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Presuming you plan to playtest, explicitly solicit feedback for how using the book(s) went.

After that and forevermore, it's a reference text. I tend to lean towards organizing as a reference text for that reason, but it's important to make sure that you still teach the game in a reasonable way.<br/><br/>There's a tendency to want to say everything exactly once. I find a little redundancy (with pointers to the page with the details) to be better. For example, "Remember, elves get a +2 bonus to saves against spells (page 13)." Of course, every time you introduce redundancy, you also increase the chance of an error of inconsistency (e.g., you say +2 bonus in one place, but you say +1 bonus in another).<br/><br/>A good editor is indispensable for all of this.<br/><br/>For your Book I, Book II problem, consider calling them chapters or sections, if you're concerned about confusion. I think gamers "get it" though.<br/><br/>I think the 6x9 format is all right, but consider issues like: <br/><br/>* At a smaller size, will it lay flat when open? <br/>* How will the charts look? Will large lists and charts even fit anymore?<br/>* Does a smaller size change your layout in terms of columns?

Rating it by the above criteria:<br/>* The "laying open" thing is an issue at times. The first and last 25% of the book don't want to stay open on their own, but the middle half of the book works fairly well. <br/>* The largest charts we have in our system will fit in 6x9 format. I took that into InDesign before I would seriously consider the possibility. <br/>* I'd put the column spread as an advantage in favor of 6x9. It is now small enough that single column works, making the text easier to read on different devices. <br/>* Looking at BWG as an example, I don't care for his border treatments, but the actual art placements look fine. They are just going to take up a solid half page or whole page at a time, rather than being something that you place like a sidebar. <br/>* I thought the BWG looks pretty good on the shelf, although, I'll grant it doesn't necessarily look like a game book. <br/><br/>I suppose the other side of the coin that could be discussed then is if one went full-sized format, how do you make that mobile friendly? Two (or god forbid, three) column text is generally what you need to make use of the space, but it also makes reading the page on a phone or tablet a real pain.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444303/#Comment_444303" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-19T20:42:27+00:00" title="March 19, 2015  8:42PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm in full agreement about mobile layouts and single-column layout in 6x9 format.<br/><br/>The other issue is keeping stuff together, especially maps and keys, if you have any of those.

Though it is advice written for the GM, players can certainly benefit from a look. </blockquote>\nThere are also chapters within each major section. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444359/#Comment_444359" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-21T04:54:20+00:00" title="March 21, 2015  4:54AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it can still be more clear and efficient. I mean, in what order do players always <i>use</i> a book? I dunno about you, I mean yes, I can read a rulebook in any order depending on my interests, but when it comes to using it, the very day the game starts, players go to character creation and then it's the GM's work to explain the mechanics. Of course, some players will do their homework and read it by themselves, others will search for anything they can breake, but most of the time, most of the players will rely on the GM for that part, specially newcomers.<br/><br/>On that side your book looks good so far (it may depend on which order is book 1 presented but I believe you've got that part covered) So let's go to how to present the book for GMs. I'd prefer to have task resolution along with conflict and call that chapter Core, because that's what tells me what's the game about and what it will do if I use the rules correctly. Also, I can't stop stating how important is to tell the GMs in bold golden letters "THIS IS THE PART YOU WILL DO GOOD INTERNALIZING" because way too often GMs will read it, think it's like D&amp;D or VtM, run the game that way and have a terrible experience because your game isn't anything like that.<br/><br/>I've seen this happen way too many times. Heck, I've got a friend who still GMs VtM as if it were friggin' D&amp;D, completely ruining the game experience. He keeps saying us he has readed the manual, but it's clear he hasn't read it enough to grasp what the game is about. Two things tell: one, he complains that he can't run really long campaigns with the came, and has modded it to include 100+ talents, skills and knowledges. Second, some players still cheat on him on the interpretation of some rules, because he keeps applying silly house rules instead of going RAW. But enough about him, all the point I'm trying to make with this paragraph is that signaling the GM how to read the book is of the utmost importance for truly grasping the game. Not underestimating the GMs and players intelligence is good, I agree, but underestimating their lazyness may prove fatal.<br/><br/>Book 3 and 4 look sweet, but again, please tell me you're making cross-references everywhere and/or explaining things several times everywhere. As a GM and a player I started to hate Pathfinder when I realized that If I didn't read the skills chapter carefully I'd totally miss the +3 bonus characters get to their trained skills, something that isn't mentioned anywhere in the character creation chapter. Realizing that I have to read even the fine print of a book to be able to play it properly stresses me out to no end. As a player, because that +3 actually matters a lot, and as a GM because i'll never be sure if players are tricking me or just using a rule I know nothing about, which would totally be my fault for not reading the fine print.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jacksonmalloy" title="jacksonmalloy"><img alt="jacksonmalloy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/618/nNDI3IZ5905UU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jacksonmalloy">jacksonmalloy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444360/#Comment_444360" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-21T05:06:35+00:00" title="March 21, 2015  5:06AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The way it's laid out currently, the first chapter of book 1 is an absolute basic When / how to roll dice to get results. If this were 3.x, it would be the equivalent of explaining that you roll a d20 and add some modifiers and then explaining how DCs work. The absolute bare basics you need in order to understand the rest of the game and its systems. <br/><br/>Chapter 2 is the full character creation process, are things like "Attributes &amp; Skills" which both detail all of the attributes and skills and how attribute and skill checks work in the greater context of the game. Edges &amp; Flaws, which list all of the rules for edges, flaws, and the descriptions thereof. While I'm actively leaving hints like (+3 if you have X, page Y) throughout the book the goal is also make it so if you need to know a thing about something, all of the information you need is in one place. <br/><br/>If the GM needed to internalize anything, it's probably the processes used in Book 2.. as those systems are sort of the heart of the game and a big part of what make it play differently than a lot of other games. Book 4 also contains a good deal of advice on best practices for a GM running the system, and I can probably repeat that recommendation there.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444361/#Comment_444361" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-21T05:58:06+00:00" title="March 21, 2015  5:58AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, spiral binding.
