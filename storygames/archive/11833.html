I played one half of a happily married gay couple with a wonderful future ahead of them - and one closet full of skeletons each. Oh, my character Robert had sort of been an accomplice when a postal worker got killed a few years back, but it really wasn't his fault, and anyway he'd changed his name since then and was a whole different person now. And his spouse Nicky was supportive and gentle and handsome. And Robert didn't know Nicky was plotting with his lover, the local gang boss, who hated his son, who was the guy who Robert killed the mail worker with.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the tilt, we found out that Robert wasn't the wuss he seemed to be - in fact, he controlled the Balkan gangsters who were pushing the local crime boss.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the aftermath, two of the characters burned to death in a car wreck, one shot himself through the head, and the last one... went to Barbados with all the cash and his new lover.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's just so easy to make stuff work with this game; it all clicks. My favorite parts:<br/>\n- Creating relationships first, and then coming up with character concepts afterwards.<br/>\n- The tilt!!! When we picked the elements, they came so naturally, and we suddenly understood what had been OBVIOUSLY going on all along (although, of course, we'd just made it up right then).<br/>\n- The aftermath, where we get short epilogues for each character.<br/>\n- Choosing to EITHER frame OR resolve a scene - and knowing that scenes have to end up with either a good or bad outcome for your character.<br/>\n- The joy of hosing each others' (and your own) character, over and over and over again.<br/>\n<br/>\nHighly recommended, fun game. It is very focused, so don't expect it to do anything else than what it says; but it does so wonderfully. Definitely hope to play it again at some point. (And I want to make a playset for it, but then I want to make a zillion other things too, so that might never actually happen).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264262/#Comment_264262" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-28T08:32:34+00:00" title="March 28, 2010  8:32AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and another favorite thing:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Few scenes<br/>\n- Few elements<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's just enough to kick things off, the tilt introduces new elements just in time, and the game finishes just before it could get boring.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_264264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264264/#Comment_264264" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-28T08:57:55+00:00" title="March 28, 2010  8:57AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome!
