Paoletta<br/>Regional Coordinator <br/><br/>InSpectres = "Fighting the forces of darkness so you don't have to." (TM)<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>So here's the deal: apparently there are many people who want to play in the InSpectres game I'm running at DexCon, so I was asked if it would be possible to add a GM to the event and run two tables, or something. If you'll be at DexCon, know InSpectres at all, and are interested in running it in the 9am-1pm slot on Saturday, let me know (in this thread or via email - n-dot-d-dot-paoletta-at-gmail-dot-com). If we're really cool we'll do some coordinated mission thing. If not, we'll just run two concurrent games. Either way, it'll be cool!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156813/#Comment_156813" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-15T22:22:20+00:00" title="July 15, 2008 10:22PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll have to check my schedule when I actually get to the convention, but I am roughly familiar with InSpectres, and have run it in the past.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
