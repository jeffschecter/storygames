                            Now the use of <br/>
(Consider the phrase "collateral damage" as an obfuscating term) <br/>
<br/>
Collateral Damage carries and holds specific menaing to me, one that most military or former military personnel might recognize ( ie damage done to adjacent targets that was not intended, but is in addition.<br/>
<br/>
Still the idea of a vocabulary strikes me, just for reviews, of indie games as a little self serving.<br/>
Not pointing any fingers, but the longer I spend in the indie game community the more mainstream I feel, I am so not deconstructionist and tend to other design criteria than I tend to see here, the forge, and at 1km1kt, as far as design ideas, merging of different game mechanisms, use of common materials, etc. <br/>
<br/>
I look over the character sheets for the Reverse Engineering contest and think, no way would i have come up with anything other than blah for it.<br/>
I read the design notes for the inprogress games and wonder what the heck I am doing over here, so out of my depth and league.<br/>
<br/>
So if you think you need a set of terms to define and quantify for youself or for the community the validity and value of a indie game design, for what ever reasons, I suggest looking at these forums, take down the different forum ideas (Narrative vs Railroading, etc.) and use those as the starting categories.                        </div>

We need less specialized vocabulary. Jargon should be avoided.  People should be able to read any single document / post relating to game theory and understand it without having to refer to multiple web sites, forums and related documents to learn the vocabulary.                        </div>

                            What if the jargon is pre-existing, from other fields, and generally recognized? One should still avoid it? <br><br/>For instance, "Known Game" is actually from Game Theory. The term has existed for more than 60 years. It's a widely understood term amongs game designers. And it's way shorter than having to write down "the game has a single, known, winning strategy, such that all players choose this strategy." Oops, but, wait, I've used the term strategy here, which is, itself, jargon in the context of Game Theory...should I also expand even mention of strategy to explain what that means in this context? <br/><br/>Jargon is not the evil monster that some want it to be. We don't come up with Jargon to obfuscate, but to enable conversation. Yes, it does create a learning curve. But overall effort is saved. Does that mean that some people will not get what people are talking about, if they don't want to learn the Jargon? Yes. So what.<br/><br/>Mike                        </br></div>

                            I don't know if we need (much) new vocabulary.  Mostly, though, this is because I think that the games that would be discussed are so dissimilar that a common vocabulary would always be stretching to fit.  What vocabulary can stretch from <em>Polaris</em> to <em>Burning Wheel</em>?  Their design constraints and functions are so dissimilar that using one set of terminology to describe both of them does them both a disservice.<br><br>Now, I don't think that absolutely no vocabulary is needed.  I mean, being able to say "the currency is unbalanced" and being understood is good.  But I don't think there are many other bits and piece of game design that we don't already have perfectly serviceable words for.                        </br></br></div>

                            Stuart, as a fan of Game Theory, I totally agree with Zero-sum, and Non-Zero Sum. <br><br/>On the other hand, you have to realize that there's this large community that's been using Incoherent this way for years now. We didn't invent it yesterday, but in 2002, if I recall correctly. It's only new to you. <br/><br/>Kludge and crock have been used since the seventies at least. The grognards may tell us that it's much older than that. Elegance as jargon is stolen from computer programming.<br/><br/>Mike                        </br></div>

                            I think instead of jargon maybe a guide to what constitutes useful criticism and what is just plain insulting or uninformative. One of the things I say to playtesters is if they come back with 'this was crap' or 'this was good' i turn off instantly an am not interested. I need to know WHY that thing is crap or good not just what you thought of it. I think the key here is to encourage good constructive criticsm rather than just critcism, even if a game is awful the designer can be helped.<br/>

Almost all of those terms are used in film theory -- but come from theatre and literary review and theory.  Which was my first point: <i>I think we should use pre-existing jargon from other disciplines when relevant</i><br/>

One of the frequent criticisms I see of RPG theory, and Forge RPG theory specifically is that it presents relatively straight-forward concepts in a needlessly complex and jargony manner, or that commonly used words are used in a non-intuitive way.<br/>

                            Hi!<br>
  I have to agree with Stuart. I don't think that a lot of RPG Theory jargon today is very intuitive or useful as a way of communicating. Take Simulationism, intuitively, you would imagine it has to do with simulating reality. About crazy rules and tables that determine how many calories you need to survive. Not about engaging a setting and adhering to a genre/license conventions.<br>
  Or Known Game, I never would have guessed that it meant that there was an optimum solution, I would have guessed it means that the mechanics are not original.<br>
  This is not to say that these distinctions are not useful or that these definitions are unknowable. But, to assume that other designers know this instinctively might be a stretch.<br>
  So, the question is a pretty valid one. How do we, as a community, come together and agree on a unified vocabulary? And, how do we, as a scommunity, convey this to new memebers of this community? Does the vocabulary have to conform to Design Patterns, Forge Glossary, Game Theory or? It seems like the learning curve is always going to be there, and we can't alleviate that. But, if we could at least ease the overall effort and flow of communication by some how consolidating this variety of sources and information, it wold be a worthwhile endeavor.<br>

                            Gah. Now I'm feeling the need to read up on sociolinguistics. I've heard that language planning is difficult at best, and it seems to me that RPG jargon has formed pretty haphazardly. There have been some directed attempts to introduce terms (GNS), but there are also a lot of enduring terms (splatbook) that evolved through newsgroups and such.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DInDenver</cite>Take Simulationism, intuitively, you would imagine it has to do with simulating reality. About crazy rules and tables that determine how many calories you need to survive. Not about engaging a setting and adhering to a genre/license conventions.</blockquote>
I'm not sure what you mean by 'intuitive' in this context, but I think you mean 'you can figure it out based on speaking English'? If you frame the issue that way, it seems obvious that jargon cannot ever be intuitive -- since generally the whole point of jargon is to ascribe a complicated, specialized meaning or series of meanings to a single term. That's why it's effective -- because it's shorthand, and because it's specialized, and consequently it cannot be understood by someone who has not learned what it means. Jargon must be learned, it cannot be guessed at, which is why it's important to clearly indicate when something is a specialized term (which is why people write Simulationism, not simulationism, most of the time.)<br><br/>This is why I am a bit skeptical of people suggesting that borrowing terms from other disciplines is the way to go -- those terms exist as specialized language for a separate discipline, and have a very specific meaning in those disciplines. The odds of this meaning mapping one to one with what we want the term to mean in RPG-land seems fairly slim -- as a result, you get a word that for some people (anyone who is familiar with the discipline from which the term is borrowed) has very strong specialized connotations that differ from the new way you want to use the term. This is likely to result in confusion. While on the one hand, it can in some cases reduce the learning curve for understanding the new jargon, on the other hand you may end up with some people who only think they understand it, based on familiarity with the original.<br/><br/>In a sense, this describes the problem DInDenver brought up with 'Simulationism' -- because it's such a recognizeable English-rooted word, people are already familiar with some possible meanings, and when the jargon usage turns out to be different (but not different enough to be clearly at odds) that produces confusion. <br/><br/>Now, I'm not suggesting that we need to rename all our jargon into nonsense words with no possible associations -- but it's definitely something to keep in mind, especially when the borrowing may be misleadingly imprecise. (For example, 'known' seems like a very straightforward and valid borrowing to me. Whereas I recall threads on the Forge about 'bricolage' that I just could not follow without severe cognitive dissonance.)                        </br></div>

Well, the short answer would be because there are more complicated concepts being expressed, and we don't have names for them yet.<br/><br/>The long answer is -- when I hear someone say that, the cynic in me translates it as 'I struggle to understand why people think there's anything worth talking about in RPG theory.' Take any important, specialized discipline that has the slightest historical or cultural importance -- from knot-tying to quantum physics -- and tell me it doesn't have at least as much jargon as the Forge Provisional Glossary. There's a reason they keep naming new theorems in mathematics -- why they say 'theory of relativity' instead of republishing the entire paper. Philosophers didn't come up with "phenomonology" and "transcendental" because they were bored -- they came up with the words so that when they wanted to talk about those things they could do so without having to redefine their terms in every conversation. It's easier to say that so and so's theory seems 'eudaimonic' than to say that it seems 'to be about happiness, but not how we usually think of it, more of a Greek notion, c.f. Aristotle' and then give three or four quotations... every time you want to make that statement.<br/><br/>I mean, I know everyone thinks jargon is the devil's word or something. Maybe we could start calling it 'specialized terminology' (irony goes here.) And I'm not trying to suggest that everyone should abandon all attempts to create easy-to-understand explanations of the terminology, or do their best to avoid inventing words just because they can. But it just seems impossible to me to claim to support the development of RPG theory on the one hand while simultaneously demanding that it continue to develop without inventing new words for whatever new concepts arise.                        </div>

                            I think that the criticisms are valid, but simply don't apply here. That is, we can discuss jargon in general till we're blue in the face, but the subject of this thread is whether or not the terms proposed for these purposes (criticism) make any sense. Stuart, you keep saying that we should use pre-existing terms, and I've shown you how most of the terms I've proposed are, in fact, pre-existing. So, that being the case, do you have some other problem with the terms in question? <br/><br/>For example, I put out my term incestuous as just that - my own term. I don't expect anyone else to use it, unless it turns out to be particularly beneficial (though it seems to me that the term seems pretty appropriate and intuitive for the phenomenon I'm describing.<br/><br/>In point of fact, Simulationism as part of GNS did evolve somewhat haphazardly, coming from an earlier model. When refined we find that it's not particularly good for describing the phenomenon in question. To that extent, lots of other terms have been proposed for the phenomenon, but none have stuck to this point. Basically Simulationism hangs around because of weight of use. Nobody is keeping it out of a sense that it's the best term.<br/><br/>But try to explain the idea behind simulationism every time you want to reference it. Actually I do this quite a lot, because, in fact, outside of The Forge, I don't use the term at all. But it's very difficult, because it's a very difficult concept. <br/><br/>Now, is the idea of a rules kludge something that can be explained easily sans using the term? Well, I don't think so. I think that the term has value, and weight of tradition (lots of people know it). But, know what? If you don't want to use the term, nobody's going to force you. Does it mean that my writing will be somewhat opaque to people who aren't long-time game designers when I do use such terms? Well I don't think that the risk is a problem. That is, sure, somebody I'm going to throw the term at is going to come back, "Kludge? Whathehellis that?" And then I'll explain it to them. And all will be fine. In the interrim, for those who do get it, I'll have saved that explanation time. <br/><br/>These critiques are not written for general public consumption anyhow, but as part of dialogs anbd discussions that are held here or at The Forge or elsewhere. If I were writing an article, I'd probably explain my terms more completely. <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

                            One of the dangers of jargon, though, is the learning curve.  You mention philosophers and physicists--both which require hefty training.  Quite literally, years of intensive study and, more importantly, *training.*  I feel like my ol' philosophy of science chops are getting a workout here--the jargon does facilitate further developments, but at the cost of requiring training to become an essential component of access to the community.<br/><br/>And the distinction between training and study is important--it is veritably impossible for someone to enter into the community of physicists or chemists or biologists or academic philosophers without having an extensive amount of time in a lab/coursework/etc.  The complexity that needs to be acquired demands a certain kind of training that study alone does not provide.<br/><br/>Given that, so far, game design and game play is a voluntary activity, a proliferation of jargon will make it less and less accessible.  The Forge already has a little of this--watch Ron when he really gets involved in an AP discussion.  He's not just talking, he's *training.*  I'm pretty sure Ron knows this--he gets in there and regulates the discussion in ways that seem too refined to be accidental.<br/><br/>I think it makes a lot of sense to consciously counter this trend to the best of our abilities if we aim to keep the hobby open.  That probably means being a little hyper-sensitive to jargon rather than acknowledging it as a necessary thing.  Sure, jargon will still develop, but it should have a harder time than jargon in disciplines like physics and academic philosophy.  In theory, we could reach a point where you need to 'go to a pro' to get your actual play analyzed or something, but I would like to hold that off as much as possible.                        </div>

<i>You're saying we should steer away from creating jargon... okay, that's an excellent goal.<br/><br/>How?</i><br/><br/><br/>My take:<br/><br/>We should borrow and modify the crap out of words when they help forward a particular discussion, that isn't so much the problem.  It is a matter of what we then move to our vocabulary.  If we find ourselves using the same, somewhat quirky word, over and over, we need to prod ourselves to think about it's place in our vocabulary, consider how it reads to an outsider.  Most importantly, we need to make sure we are listening to people when they are voicing concern over a particular term.  It doesn't mean we toss it out, but we ought to be careful that we can explain it to them, in everyday parlance.  <br/><br/>We need to watch that our discussions are not entirely predicated on the dropping of a series of jargon terms (this is tough, because jargon becomes more and more transparent to its users--why it is good to jump on this task early).  That jargon tends to appear in an otherwise 'everyday' mode of talking about the subject.  That inquiry is met with ready explanation.  <br/><br/>The good news: this is largely how things stand now, esp. here on Story Games.  We just need to be aware of the fact that there are pressures (social and linguistic) pushing us away from that, and that we ought not think of those pressures as the 'natural' or 'ideal' trend.                        </div>

Really think about what you're trying to express and consider how you would explain the concept to someone outside of the "inner circle" of people familiar with RPG Theory / Forge Theory jargon.  The more sense the statement makes without familiarity and acceptance of a lot of other theories and jargon, the better.                        </div>

<p>I think you're totally off-base here, and I am having a very hard time explaining exactly why. I think it has to do with your use of the words "acceptance" and "familiarity"; I don't think that what for instance Mike is suggesting has anything to do with that.</p>

Ideally, yes.  Unless you're only talking to the inner circle, or deliberately trying to exclude wider discussion.Some use of jargon is inevitable -- but we should try and avoid it if possible... and certainly not seek out <i>more</i>.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of jargon brings along unintended assumptions as well.  If you are discussing a point and say "Gamer joe is a simulationist..." -- I might be more inclined to reject your statement because I believe it's built on a bad foundation (if for example I reject GNS outright).  However, if you said "Joe wants to simulate a realistic medieval world in his game..."  -- you've taken a few extra words, and now your point stands (or not) on it's own merits.                        </div>

If you want to talk to people outside the inner circle, there is literally no alternative.<br><br>This is something that comes up over and over in criticisms of the Forge-and-sons community (and I perceived this as a problem at first, although I'm not sure how I feel about it now): when new people come into a community and start familiarizing themselves with the ideas prevalent within the community, they want to talk about these ideas until they feel comfortable with them -- but there's no place to do that in this community, because the response is characteristically "We've [the preexisting community denizens] already talked about GNS/the Big Model/the Lumpley Principle/whatever, and we're not interested in having the same debates over and over again."  Imagine if college classes operated on this principle.  The problem is that this is not something you can solve with a glossary, any more than you can solve it with a textbook.                        </br></br></div>

<p>Which is a challenge of having a <em>community</em> that talks formally and specifically about a particular field, without any support for educating people in that field, yes.</p>
<p>Though, frankly, this is only a problem if the community sincerely wants to increase, and to bring in people who are not autodidacts, but also people who have different learning approaches. I think this would be a nice thing for the community to want, but I don't assume that it wants it.</p>

<br/>
The example I gave was "Gamer joe is a simulationist..." which I would reject because it refers to the 3-way split in the GNS theory which splits all gamers into 3 groups, allows for no overlap, and misses a lot of more general reasons for why people play RPGs (Social, Immersion, Humour, Risk, etc).<br/>
<br/>
When someone says "simulationism" I might not immediately think GNS.  Even if I do, it's not a matter of not thinking the concept doesn't exit -- just taking issue with how it's used in the GNS theory.<br/>

                            a&gt; Actually, when derivatives first came out, there was a good deal of debate on the topic.  Went on for a few years.  There were many people in the mathematical community who felt that "instantaneous change" was a suspect concept.  They turned out to be wrong, which is why noone remembers them.  One thing they didn't do, however, was argue that people should use "the instantaneous rate of change of a function with respect to one of its variables" instead.<br><br>b&gt; Our first-year classes are ALL OVER THE PLACE.    We just need to point people to them better.<br><br/>There's a lot of good material over at the Forge "Articles" section.  <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/articles/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/articles/</a><br/><br/>We could also point to <a href="http://random.average-bear.com/TheoryTopics/HomePage" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://random.average-bear.com/TheoryTopics/HomePage</a><br/><br/>If someone reads them and wants to discuss, they can open a thread here, or at the Forge, or on a blog, and ask questions.  What I don't think ANYONE expects them to do is to interrupt a thread that references the theories with a requirement to explain them all, within the thread.  It would be impossible to get anything done.  If you want to build high, you HAVE to be allowed to stack your bricks.                        </br></br></br></div>

I'm not sure I have a good answer to that, but I think our current methodology is pants.  We have a whole bunch of confusing terminology, often with rat-hole definitions.  I think the argument could be made it's a result of the current "first namer" rule.<br/><br/>I both agree with Stuart and disagree on the jargon issue.<br/><br/>On the one hand, yes I want to be as inclusive as possible.  On the other, Fred's point about stacking bricks is well taken.

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Isbo</cite>One of the dangers of jargon, though, is the learning curve. [...]<br/> <br/>I think it makes a lot of sense to consciously counter this trend to the best of our abilities if we aim to keep the hobby open. </blockquote>
It seems to me that there's some conflation going on here between the hobby of roleplaying, the hobby of roleplaying game design, and the hobby of roleplaying game theory. It's true that there's a lot of overlap going on between these three activities, but they aren't the same thing. When I say that it is impossible to continue with roleplaying game theory without creating new jargon, this implies that the hobby of roleplaying game theory will become less and less open as the theory develops. As you point out, it is already fairly difficult to penetrate -- extensive study and training is already required.<br/><br/>Whether or not this has to carry over to roleplaying itself and game design seems like another matter. I don't design games, but I do play them -- and I am interested in the theory. It seems like other configurations that don't involve an interest in theory are possible -- you don't need to understand every nuance of the theory to design a game, but understanding the basics probably helps a lot. But, again, what does it mean to keep game design 'open' as a hobby? If someone came in with a game they designed and had never heard of Simulationism, but it was still an awesome game, would they somehow be denied access to publishing and to the game market represented by The Forge and related communities?<br/><br/>I brought up physics and philosophy as some extreme examples -- those disciplines have considerable history and deal with matters that are basically infinite in complexity. However, it is the case that as rpg theory progresses, more and more study &amp; training will be required for those who wish to become seriously involved. Is this a good thing? From my point of view it is, because it means we're actually getting somewhere. If a community of smart people spends five years studying something and in the end they can explain all they've learned in a ten-minute speech... well, that sounds like there really wasn't all that much to discover.<br/><br/>ETA: There also seems to be a lot of confusion in this thread between "discussion among people who know the theory" and "discussions in public" -- and part of the problem there is, I think, an underlying assumption that if it's on the Internet, and you can get to it, then it counts as "in public." This is, well, wrong. The idea that people on a specialized, private site like The Forge have an obligation to make their discussions accessible to the general public is... well, it seems a little absurd. Just because anyone in the world could theoretically sign up and read a post, does not mean that post is aimed at everybody in the world. When people use arguments like "well, if you want to be understood, you have to cut out jargon" it seems like a rhetorical trick. Obviously, they want to be understood -- but probably they want to be understood mostly <i>by other people who have some idea what they're talking about already.</i> <br/><br/>Yes, there are threads and posts specifically targetted at reaching a broader audience, but there seems to be an ongoing assumption among some people that every thread must be such a thread. As Fred points out, this is a good recipe for never getting anywhere -- few people want to start discussions for the sole purpose of teaching others (Note: Ron Edwards starts these kinds of conversations all the time, impressively.) Most want to start discussions that have a chance of teaching them something as well, and those discussions can rarely occur in a "public" space.                        </div>

Well, I thought I was answering one question.  My apologies for not addressing the conflict.<br/><br/>Thinking about this over the weekend, I saw an ideal example.  We were playing <cite>The Shab-al-hari Roach</cite> and it crashed and burned, for reasons I won't belabor here.  But out of the ashes we started a conversation about what had happened, and the only use of theory jargon came from one player, and in each case the group decided it was a misuse (not that we really debated that point much, there was just an immediate consensus.)  In other words, we were talking about our play, and how it was or wasn't working, quite absent any gaming jargon.  (Aside: there was some lit jargon thrown around, but two of the players are writers, and the rest of us followed that just fine.)<br/><br/>Here's my point: I don't think that theory jargon necessarily aids immediate discussion of play.  But I do think there are other fields in whatever academic approach we want to take to RPGs as art.  I don't think that anyone needs jargon in day to day play.<br/><br/>As a corollary, I'd recommend that jargon never appear in any game text.  Credos about gaming at the back of games: fine.  In the actual text: recommend against.  <br/><br/>The Rubicon here is stepping into theory.  I happen to belong to a camp that believes that gaming theory can help us design better games.  And possibly even to improve our gaming at the table.  (I'm still of two mind as to whether it helps at the table in any other way but by helping us design our own home brew systems off of games we half-like.)<br/><br/>And I'd specifically suggest that while theory and actual play should be related, I'd like to see theory relate more strongly to critique.  And critique seems to me to be a very appropriate place to find (and refine) field-specific jargon.  Furthermore, I think critique that included jargon would tend to provide excellent context for newcomers to learn by example.<br/><br/>The flipside to all of that is that I expect their to be a somewhat insular, even if welcoming, community devoted to theory.  It's not for everyone.  There's plenty of folks who can't stand it, and are better off not dealing with it at all.  And it's not that anyone is a better person.  Or even that theory is useless - it finds its way to the light of day in games.<br/><br/>But we can have a culture of theory, marked by its use of jargon, without excluding outsiders from a culture of gaming.  By not using jargon when it's out of place: namely, when we're talking about play and not about theory.                        </div>

<i> If a community of smart people spends five years studying something and in the end they can explain all they've learned in a ten-minute speech... well, that sounds like there really wasn't all that much to discover.</i><br/><br/>Clearly, this is also an 'extreme' example, moreso than the examples of philosophy and physics which you used previously.  But make it less extreme and I would gladly use it as an ideal--people spend five years studying a problem and once they are done, it's an entry in a textbook, heck, maybe for a real important study, it is a textbook.  But, either way, it is something that can be consumed by others in a remarkably short time.  Problems inspire terminological and theoretical proliferation until something begins to work, at which point the 'working' section gets slimmed down and tightened.<br/><br/>The idea that the density of the jargon should reflect the effort that goes into the project is just plain silly to me.  People work years in order to get solutions that other people can then get in days and weeks.  It is the work of making sense that requires your 'smart people'--not the results at the end of it all.  Otherwise, you would need to go over the whole course of a development just to start to contribute.  You only need 'smart people' when you try to take that work and apply it forward, to new problems.  The opposition to jargon outright is, of course, problematic.  But the effort to keep jargon at a minimum is not.  It is what keeps smart people flowing into the community and working out tough problems.<br/><br/>And the question of keeping jargon down say, at the Forge, is not a red-herring.  It is exactly the point mentioned above--not a demand for it to be publically accessible to any and all readers, but for it to be accessible to any designer who wants to up their game.  For any person involved in the craft, it can (and I feel should) be 'public' in that sense because we aren't a physics department, we don't have a big educational structure to support entry.  <br/><br/>Of course, as people have said, this is only something to strive for if you *want* new blood.  If you just want to talk to people who know all the lingo, then don't bother.  Seriously, no sarcasm.                        </div>

                            Judson, if you do a search, you'll find that I always advocate keeping theory discussions out of discussions of play with players. Not just ones that use jargon, but all such discussions. The problem is that players will feel personally attacked, and no good can come of that. <br/><br/>Everybody agrees that you have to consider the context of the use of these terms, and, indeed, of discussing theory at all. So the question of whether or not jargon is helpful is not at all illuminated by saying that it's harmful in some contexts. Nobody disagrees with that. <br/><br/>Stuart, saying that wanting to use Jargon is indicative of a desire to exclude people is like saying that people who like listening to Jazz and put it on their radios are trying to alienate country music listeners. Couldn't it merely be that we find it useful to ourselves? The insinuation is quite insulting. <br/><br/>For two reasons, especially. For one, I do stop to explain terms or avoid them when I think the audience won't know them. See all my posts on the FATE board, or the HQ mailing lists, for instance. Even moreso galling, because I've taught the 100 level class a couple of dozen times. Oh, you didn't happen to be on my roster when I was teaching it a couple of years back? Sorry. Do I have an obligation to teach you? Nope. Note that when we were all involved in developing the theories in question, we didn't have anyone to teach us. We had to teach ourselves. <br/><br/>Oh, one last thing. One of the reasons that the GNS forum was closed before the Theory forum is because it's progenitor, Ron, and people like myself, all agree that GNS is really pretty unimportant in terms of the overall theory, and that too much discussion was going into redefining things endlessly. Yeah, basically we agreed that it was too much jargon about nothing, and decided to stop talking about it. That others seem to think that they're being excluded because they're not getting taught this relatively unimportant stuff is odd. <br/><br/>But, know what? If you really want to learn the theory, then I'll teach it. I could as easily insinuate that you're here simply to throw stones, and don't have any intent to try to understand the theory. But I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that you haven't extended to anyone else. <br/><br/>So, do you want the class? If so, where would you like to begin?<br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

I'm sorry you were insulted by that, but you really shouldn't have been...  it's pretty generic advice, and no more specific to RPG theory than it is to writing about IT.<br/>

                            Something I liked about the Wikipedia article above is that it made a good disctinction between real jargon and terminology. Specialized terminology is helpful. Try having a conversation about "railroading", "broken games", "balance" or the like with 5 normal players and you'll get 5 different opinions on what the words mean. You can't have an indepth discussion if noone is agreeing about what the words mean. I remember a few Forge threads where we spent 3 or 4 pages just getting on the same page about what exactly we were talking about.<br/>
<br/>
Specialized terminology faciliates communication, and if indepth discussions are your goal, then specialized terminology is inevitable.                        </div>

                            Stuart, <br><br>How does it follow that if I'm willing to teach you the theory that this means that I feel that you need to agree with the theory before you can discuss it? <br><br>That's such a complete non-sequitur, I don't know where to start. Frankly I don't agree with lots of the theory, so how I could be insulted by you disagreeing with it, I don't know. Understanding something, and agreeing with it, are two entirely different things. It is hard to really disagree with something unless you understand it, however. <br><br>In any case, we were talking about jargon, and it's usefullness or lack thereof. The complaint from William (pigeon) and others was that they feel they can't learn the jargon without a class on it. My point to all of you is that we've always been willing to go to great lenghts to explain our terminology when asked, and, in fact, don't use it out of context. If you don't want to invest the time to learn that, for whatever reason, that's fine, you all seem to do just fine here without it. Nobody is saying it's neccessary for everyone to learn, it's just there if you're interested. <br/><br/>If you're not? <br/><br/>OK. <br/><br/>Mike                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

Man, why can't I sum everything up in a couple of sentences.  I think that, on reflection, I'd add a community that's applying theory without teaching it, with a similar lack of restriction about location or membership.

You and I agree on that point.  It was my impression that Stuart's approach did depend on the context of outsiders who aren't interested in delving into theory.  Separately, I think that there are several (although not many here) who don't consciously make a good distinction between theory discussion, where jargon is a useful tool, and practical discussion, where it can be alienating or (at worst) demeaning.

By no means whatsoever does anyone have to agree on a school of thought to contribute here.  That's been my experience, and I hope that's the way it stays.  On the other hand, I think it's definitely a boon to understand different schools of thought, different models, so that we can have a reasoned discourse.  I someday hope to see the likes of "dear boy, you aren't maintaining the GNS model, are you?"  More approaches have got to be good, to my mind, and a theoretical monoculture is not desirable.<br/><br/>To that end, I'm going to go print out and actually read all of Brian's <a href="http://www.kumapageworks.org/PDFs/AGE_Model_1.1.pdf" rel="nofollow">AGE Model,</a> even though my current stance is that the quest for a unified model is a red herring.                        </div>

                            Hi!<br/>
  OK, just to be clear. I wasn't saying we don't need any more jargon. In fact, I think this industry would benefit greatly from well-defined, commonly-agreed upon jargon.<br/>
  What I have a general disagreement with is jargon that is non-sensical or counter-intuitive. And by intuitive I mean, if you understand after its explained to you. Simulationism is a good example of a term that is counter-intuitive. In that it does not help with communication. When you read it before you know what the definition is, a meaning appears as one thing in your mind. After you know what it means, you can never be sure that the person you are talking to knows what it means. The definition and the root meaning are so startkly contrasted with each other.<br/>
  I think most of the terms that people have come up with are intuitive. But I did want to come up with some examples of bad jargon so we can mayb dodge that bullet before its fired.<br/>

My advice then, which I'll be taking to my own heart as well, is to respond to uses of "Simulationism" (in your case) with a statement of the form:<br/><br/><code><br/>I find the term "Simulationism" very ambiguous.  I'm personally confused about its meaning, and find that very few people actually agree on what it actually means.  For more depth on my position, see &lt;a href="#"&gt;this article of mine.&lt;/a&gt; In the meantime, lets see if we can avoid that hurdle by talking about what we actually mean.  In this case...<br/></code><br/><br/>You know?  At least get people thinking about the language they use.  Ron had a decent point he framed a little strongly about the word "stakes" elsewhere, for instance.  I don't know if I'll stop using the word "stakes" in my designs, but I'll certainly not let it stand for a bunch of hand-waving and bad practice.                        </div>
