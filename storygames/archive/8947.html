One of my favorite Jeep things is Bird-in-Ear, which is a simple technique for shredding the idea of character ownership in a fun, engaging, productive way.  So I took it on and wrote a simple scene that, hopefully, illustrates Bird-in-Ear through play.  <br/><br/>So here's <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/jeep/exit_interview.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Exit Interview</a>.  It's designed for 3-14 players, is not about drunks, prostitutes, cancer patients or molested children, and should take way less than an hour.  I'd love it if you'd take a look and especially if you want to try it out!  I need to know if this is a solid introduction to this one focused technique, and if the instructions make sense to people who haven't played a Jeepform game before.  It should be a little ridiculous and pretty fun. <br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197632/#Comment_197632" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-18T12:57:29+00:00" title="March 18, 2009 12:57PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Jason doesn't say is that it's an exit interview for a guy leaving a Justice League-like superhero/villain group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197644/#Comment_197644" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-18T13:38:44+00:00" title="March 18, 2009  1:38PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah, that!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198093/#Comment_198093" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-20T16:08:15+00:00" title="March 20, 2009  4:08PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice idea.<br/><br/>When you mention two interview scenes being played simultaneously, how do you exactly picture that happening?

The plan is a series of semi-integrated little scenes/exercises that can be run alone or in a series.  I know there are a couple more in the works - one on telegraphing and one on hypertext scenes and playing with time.  My hope is that they will be a pretty light and flexible way to show off the neat features of Jeepform, so people can take those techniques and do other things with them or explore more serious Jeep games without trepidation.<br/><br/>I asked three Jeep guys what they thought the top five topics/techniques ought to be, and they gave me eight, so...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sven" title="sven"><img alt="sven" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sven">sven</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198154/#Comment_198154" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-21T11:23:45+00:00" title="March 21, 2009 11:23AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "I can't imagine why you'd want to talk over each other, though."<br/><br/>Well, I agree it doesn't make much sense in this game. But generally it can have its boons. What the Jeep calls Swarm of players (if I remember correctly) is an example of this. It is also one of the (few...) things that attracts me to larp; the idea that you can - and have to - choose which flow of information you should take part in, even though it is all in the same game. This can to some extent be useful also in freeform.<br/><br/>About Exit interview: I guess you assumedthere to be an implicit organizer with some traditional GM duties? Since it wasn't mentioned I assumed that there was no one with power to cut and direct the game flow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198159/#Comment_198159" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-21T12:28:23+00:00" title="March 21, 2009 12:28PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another good thing to make clear, Sven.

Perhaps I am a bit anal about stating game procedures. <br/><br/>I certainly did misunderstand it the way I just described. I didn't try to be clever or anything, I just assumed that was what you aimed for. With one pair it seems really clear and simple to me. But the spot-light switching with two pairs isn't obvious to me. If I was playing I would definitely prefer to have that made clear and also whose responsibility it is to change spotlight. I can't see it working without that made clear.<br/><br/>The traditional Jeep way of doing it is of course to have one GM-like person, a super facilitator or something who decides the spotlight shifting. But you could as well just tell the two pairs that it is their responsibilty to see to it that they shift, as I think is your idea. That would certainly work and could, as you mentioned above, lead to some really fun back-and-forth play.<br/><br/>At least I can say this: Personally,as a player, I would need this to be stated directly to me. *Especially* if I didn't read the text and just dropped in as a player on a con. In that case I would definitely assume that I was just supposed to play on until someone told me something different.

Muad'Dib speaks out about feeling uncomfortable using a public bathroom. Sand in the bed can ruin a relationship even on a desert planet. And shouldn't Princess Irulan do some cooking instead of all that hammering on the typewriter day out and day in? She is his wife after all.<br/><br/>EDIT: I switched a name to cover up my Freudian slip.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198189/#Comment_198189" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-21T17:20:18+00:00" title="March 21, 2009  5:20PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 21, 2009 5:20PM by John_Harper.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was saving my comments until I played it, but now it looks like I won't be able to make that happen for a while.<br/><br/>So: I like it! The presentation is great, especially the forms. Bird-in-Ear is something we did in our recent WFRP series (without realizing it was a thing) to great success.

And your experience is exactly the sort of thing I want to promote - a lot of Jeep stuff is very portable.  There's no reason you can't use Bird-in-Ear in your 4E game or whatever, as you already know.  It's just a name for something some people are already doing, but that other people may not have even considered.  It certainly took me by surprise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198271/#Comment_198271" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-22T15:15:27+00:00" title="March 22, 2009  3:15PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neat!<br/>I'm thinking this would be like a gazillion times better explained thru a brief youtube video.<br/>I can still squeeze into my Killer Shrew costume...if you're...at all...interested.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198277/#Comment_198277" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-22T16:58:25+00:00" title="March 22, 2009  4:58PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're probably right.
