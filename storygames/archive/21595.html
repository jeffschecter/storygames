(I'm sufficiently experienced that I can usually tell in the first 10 seconds after a GM opens their mouth if their game is going to be any good.)<br/><br/>But if I *am* going to try to redirect a bad GM, there's only one way I've found that ever works with a minimum of collateral damage. It's to insist on enforcing the rules in ways disadvantageous to the players.<br/><br/>Because why do GMs often get so up-in-arms about players insisting on fidelity to the rules? Ostensibly, they don't want players to get some sort of unearned advantage. So if I'm sitting there, going, "No, you can't use that Feat right now because X..." to another *player*, suddenly that narrative starts to shift, and it's clear that my intention is simply that we should *all* follow the rules. That then, <i>sometimes</i>, when the stars align, gives me enough credibility later on to insist on some player-empowering rule being followed.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472133/#Comment_472133" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-17T03:02:39+00:00" title="April 17, 2018  3:02AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472139/#Comment_472139" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-17T04:31:39+00:00" title="April 17, 2018  4:31AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            -1                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472143/#Comment_472143" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-17T05:42:35+00:00" title="April 17, 2018  5:42AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Again, this doesn't mesh with my own experience of why GMs railroad. They aren't openly speaking about player's gaining an advantage. They want to wrestle control back from the gloracle, and, they claim that better flow&amp;drama&amp;'fairness' is the reason ("no-one should die unless they choose it so I'll fudge in deathly situations" is often heard, as is "they're so optimized that I've stopped using monster HP, I just pretend to, so I can make the fights more dramatic").<br/><br/>Rules lawyering, regardless of who it's favoring, goes against both their real reason (desire for control) and their stated reason (better drama) and doesn't go over well.<br/><br/>I've also tried the opposite, "if they as GM can make hidden rolls, then so can I as player make hidden rolls and fudge" as some GMs have said in debates that they're OK with. But in practice the ones I've played with haven't been OK with that at all.<br/><br/>My main strat when encountering railroaders is to try to steer them to a story game instead. Usually I do go with an emergent narrative like Fiasco or Microscope over a scripty one like Dread or bomby one like Sorcerer. But I'd rather them pre-script a game meant for pre-scripting, or bomb a game meant for bombing, than playing in some 90:s style morass.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472146/#Comment_472146" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-17T07:57:08+00:00" title="April 17, 2018  7:57AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm pretty much going to skip right over the fully loaded OP here and say this: if the game I'm playing in is a railroad and I'm the only one not enjoying that, I'll make my apologies and leave.

Because folks who know him, know that he just doesn't tolerate a lot of bullshit, and he can be pretty direct and vocal about it.<br/><br/>I tend to get out of convention games if I'm not having fun. If it's "eh, this isn't bad, just meh," I might sit through a full session if I think my leaving will inconvenience other people at the table. If I sit there for 45 minutes listening to the GM explain the backstory, or the GM says "It really doesn't matter what you roll on the dice most of the time, as long as you're entertaining," or I get 5 minutes of spotlight time in the first 140 minutes of play, or we're literally in a "rocks fall, everyone is trapped in the cave, fight monsters!" railroad ...

That matches my experience.<br/><br/>I also agree with people who say that "they just leave", but, in practice that can be stymied by two things:<br/><br/>* Railroading practices aren't always immediately apparent. Many of the techniques are hidden from the players (e.g the GM fudging monster hit points).<br/><br/>Even in retrospect, sometimes it's hard to spot subtler forms of railroading - and if there is a lot of doubt we're reduced to a "he said/she said" situation.<br/><br/>* The <i>Mystery GM Cult</i> is so strong for some people, that it means that we're simply *not allowed to even talk about the possibility*. In other words, me asking a GM whether they would change an outcome or force a certain event in play will always be met with a strong refusal (regardless of what the GM actually does) and taken as an offensive accusation. <br/><br/>Worse yet, for some people it's so strong that they don't even <i>admit it to themselves</i>. That's when it gets really tricky.<br/><br/>As an example of the former, I recently played in a convention game which was definitely railroaded, complete with a very specific pre-scripted ending where the players had no valid choices to make and ended up dead.<br/><br/>However, the nature of the game was not at all apparent until the very last moments of play. There was no way I could have simply left the table early, because it was very hard to tell that anything like that was going on. (The scenario revolved around a big mystery underlying everything, but we had no idea about that. In practice, it meant that we couldn't tell whether events happening were being scripted or not - and I don't think they were, on the small scale. It's only in the retrospective provided by the final reveal that we could see that various actions and choices we made had no real impact on the final outcome. In play, however, without knowing the Underlying Truth of the scenario, that was impossible to judge.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472186/#Comment_472186" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-17T20:52:20+00:00" title="April 17, 2018  8:52PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 17, 2018 8:53PM by David_Berg.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the bigger (and maybe easier?) thing to watch out for is GMs who are power tripping or don't care about the players, regardless of whether they initially use railroad techniques or not.<br/><br/>A well-intentioned GM using ineffective techniques: maybe we can work things out.<br/><br/>A GM who's like, "I am God!": if you play, all you can do is hope that their whims go your way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472201/#Comment_472201" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-17T21:32:57+00:00" title="April 17, 2018  9:32PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>* The <i>Mystery GM Cult</i> is so strong for some people, that it means that we're simply *not allowed to even talk about the possibility*.
