I welcome any comments y'all might have about it, either here or in that thread.  We had all of one previous player-session's worth of experience amongst the five of us, so I figure there's plenty of learning we can do.  <br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303187/#Comment_303187" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-04T06:05:51+00:00" title="December  4, 2010  6:05AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interested!<br/>I'm trying to setup a game next week with some not so experienced players (hopefully),<br/><br/>What was the background of your players? (I notice most of them were first time Fiasco players - but do they play other RPGs normally?)<br/><br/>What are some thing that players sew to Fiasco can expect to have difficulty with? The basic rules seem very easy to get the grip of (I can recite most of them by heart already). Did you find players mostly setting the scene, or resolving the scene?  Was there any difficulty in players setting up scenes with forgone (in their minds) conclusions and things not turning out how they wanted?<br/><br/>K                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/daw65" title="daw65"><img alt="daw65" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/daw65">daw65</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303214/#Comment_303214" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-04T11:53:33+00:00" title="December  4, 2010 11:53AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I'd only met two of the others about 15 minutes before we started playing, so I don't really know their background, and for full disclosure, one of those two is the one who had expressed some reservations on the RPGG thread.  The fellow who had played Fiasco before has played other games before -- He GM'ed a game of InSpectres at the previous year's con, so I knew him a bit, and the other player has a fair bit of role playing experience, including some Norwegian LARP (easy to do when you live in Norway :-) ).  <br/><br/>As for me, I have a whole bunch of D&amp;D experience, starting with basic D&amp;D and stopping just as AD&amp;D 2E was released.  After a 20+ year hiatus, I've since played a season plus another pitch session of Primetime Adventures, and that previously mentioned InSpectres game from last year.  But I've read a ton, and I think I had a good idea of what to expect.  <br/><br/>In the scene where my character got kidnapped, I went into the scene totally thinking I had the upper hand.  But they grabbed a black die, and my upper hand ended up tied behind my back.  I very clearly remember thinking to myself, "Hey, that's not right!  No, wait:  suck it up, and roll with it."  So, yeah, that'll happen, and you and your group will need to work it out.<br/><br/>But I think we all were pretty OK with that.  The group issue we faced was more story pacing. There was one specific confrontation that was going to occur, and it <b>nearly</b> occurred three or four times, but things in the story kept getting in the way.  Some in the group felt that we should have just let it happen, and move on.  I felt that the interruptions fit the genre pretty well, and they nicely escalated the tension in the story until the turning point occurred for the confronter.  It's at a more foundational level than scene to scene issues, and I think it's more due to being new to each other, rather than being new to Fiasco.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/daw65" title="daw65"><img alt="daw65" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/daw65">daw65</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303216/#Comment_303216" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-04T11:56:07+00:00" title="December  4, 2010 11:56AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And thanks so much, Jason, for chiming in on the RPGG thread.
