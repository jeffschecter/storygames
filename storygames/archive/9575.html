I dint run the game, spycraft is not my thing but the game picked my curiosity :)<br/>\nSince after the game session I talked a lot about the game, my group asked me if I wanted to try to play Operations (GM) on our next session. I said yes :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut after reading the rules a few times, I think I need some advices on the betrayal aspect of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn our session, nobody betrayed anyone. I think we just dint need to. We dint really need those extra dices and nothing else motivated us to betray each other or use player vs player conflict to drive the game. <br/>\n<br/>\nBetrayal make me think about the Fate in The Mountain Witch. So I wonder, maybe something like this is needed? Maybe it could help to give each character a secret agenda? Should it be done at character creation? Or when (or after) making the plan for the mission? Anyone tried something like this? <br/>\n<br/>\n(I wonder also if WoM could be easily played without a game master, if so, how?)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212387/#Comment_212387" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-15T12:52:41+00:00" title="June 15, 2009 12:52PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, Evlyn! Welcome to SG!<br/><br/>I think the idea is implicit in the game-as-written that yes, you can (and perhaps should) give secret missions to the players beforehand, either at character creation (representing personal objectives or secret plots) or right as the mission begins (either before or after the players rough out the mission details).<br/><br/>That said, if you're not finding you need the Trust Dice, then there's no reason to use them. I've only run WoM once, and although I did give my PCs secret missions (about halfway through, just as alliances were forming, I specifically created secret missions to drive wedges in the group), the players found they weren't calling on them very often.<br/><br/>Trust Dice are there to create an atmosphere of distrust. Wick specifically references <i>Alias</i>. James Bond, too, never knows who's going to stab him in the back. If you want the PCs to be able to trust each other implicitly (like the excellent comic series <i>Queen &amp; Country</i> by Greg Rucka) then don't worry about Trust.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if your players are aware of the Trust mechanic, and you don't use it for several sessions with the same spies, and then suddenly one day you hand three dice to one of their number, alarm bells will go off, big time.<br/><br/>I think WoM could be easily hacked to run without a game master. All the GM really provides is the initial mission and then someone to introduce complications. My experience was that the highly-experienced team tended to break up to accomplish the things in their area of specialty anyway, so there's no reason that the player of an "idle" character couldn't just take over the GM hat while waiting for their turn. All you need to do is make sure that everyone feels they are getting sufficient face time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212389/#Comment_212389" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-15T12:55:29+00:00" title="June 15, 2009 12:55PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, two more things:<br/><br/>1) It might be interesting after the first session to allow the players to pick their <i>own</i> secret missions for future games and contact you about them privately. If you chum the metaphorical waters, your players will act like hungry sharks.<br/><br/>2) If you are finding that your players have enough missions dice that they don't need Trust Dice, but you want to use Trust, just increase the time-based penalties. Maybe a -5 to outcomes every 20 minutes is leaving your group with too much power. Make it -7, and see what happens. They'll be begging for trust dice soon enough.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/E" title="E"><img alt="E" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/E">E</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212505/#Comment_212505" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-15T20:20:30+00:00" title="June 15, 2009  8:20PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the tips. <br/>\n<br/>\nSince I play with 4 players (2 couples), maybe I will ask them to make agents from two different agency who have to work together. <br/>\n(2 players on each side). <br/>\nMaybe after making the main plan I could ask privately each groups to come up with a secondary objective for their faction. <br/>\nSo that each players will have to choose between betraying the other faction or their own faction (by not betraying the other faction). <br/>\n<br/>\nI will discuss this with my group, but I would like us to aim for a romantic action comedy like Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith or True Lies.
