He uses an example where an author creates a compelling situation and then ruins it with bad prose. I think *Reservoir Dogs* was guilty of it, at the very end, when they roll credits and play "The Lime &amp; The Coconut" - you've got this serious intense drama and then "ha ha, just a movie, let's play a silly song." I love the movie anyway but imagine if the credits had rolled silently, asking the audience to stay with it a bit longer.<br/><br/>I think I'm frequently guilty of frigidity in one-shot games - I'll gleefully usher my character to a train wreck and laugh. "Wasn't that just like a tragedy?" I'll think.<br/><br/>In long-form games, not a problem - if my character dies, that character I spent so many hours with, I'll be like - woah. I miss him. Can't believe he's dead.<br/><br/>Montsegur and Shock are the one-shots where I've cared about the characters the most, though still not as much as long-form.  <br/><br/>How can we bring that long-form caring-about-your-characters to one-shots?  Can we concentrate the secret sauce in Montsegur and Shock?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu" title="kobutsu"><img alt="kobutsu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c22b7a0141698356c899c4f7f1200ed7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu">kobutsu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321442/#Comment_321442" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-21T13:21:56+00:00" title="April 21, 2011  1:21PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I think that <em>Dread</em> does this very well: it offers a slim shred of hope, that everyone is fighting over, and gives you the opportunity to create much of your character\u2014and I mean character, not crunchy stats\u2014while still guiding you to make a character that <em>fits</em>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321446/#Comment_321446" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-21T13:59:41+00:00" title="April 21, 2011  1:59PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Caring is a collective activity, particularly in one-shots.

"You get to keep one of these," he says, adjusting his top hat against the tropical sun.  "The other one's going to be crushed into a small cube at dawn tomorrow.  Do whatever you want with 'em, kid."<br/><br/>Is it a good use of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me to choose one car to keep, and leave the other one in the garage?  Or should I take the car I don't want out for a death-defying, tire-smoking, engine-redlining spin around the track, knowing that it doesn't matter if it gets banged up, because it'll be destroyed at sunup anyway?  And is that experience going to be more intense and entertaining than letting it sit in the garage, or less?<br/><br/>Part of the opportunity of a one-shot is that you can push the limits and take crazy risks.  You don't have to ponder long-term consequences or worry about what happens tomorrow:  when the sun comes up, you will never see this thing again, so why not rev it up and see what it can really do?<br/><br/>And that, I think, is where you have to look for ways to care about your one-shot character: figure out what would be interesting (to you) for the character to care about, and then pursue that, boldly and without compromise.  You've decided that your character's goal is to marry the girl?  Then just go ahead and do <i>whatever it takes</i> to make that happen.  Fully engage with the premise that this is your character's very last chance at love (because it is!), and see where that takes you.<br/><br/>Maintaining ironic detachment from a one-shot character is a choice you make, not a requirement.  There's no reason why you can't take advantage of the unique opportunity afforded by a one-shot and really get invested in whatever it is that one-shot character cares about.<br/><br/>Mind you, you won't have a lot of time to try out different things, so it's probably good to decide as a player what you want to engage with, and then set up the character to obsessively pursue that very thing.  Personally, I steal a lot for one-shot characters, from books and movies and TV shows and real life.  I pick something I know will be fun or something I really want to try (romantic entanglements, moral conflicts, whatever), crank it up to 11, and make that the character's overriding interest so that I can pack as much play with that idea into our session as possible.  If I can care about the interest, I'll care about the character.<br/><br/>There are other approaches, I'm sure, but that's the one I come back to most often.<br/><br/>EDIT:<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Harlequin</cite>It seems more dependent on the people predisposing themselves to the idea, rather than anything the game does to draw it out of you.</blockquote>...is a nice, succinct way to put it.  The easiest way to care about a one-shot character is to make a one-shot character that you already care about.  One-shot characters who are blank slates or who otherwise don't have solid motivations <i>that you are already on board with</i> are not going to be one-shot characters that will work for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu" title="kobutsu"><img alt="kobutsu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c22b7a0141698356c899c4f7f1200ed7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu">kobutsu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321468/#Comment_321468" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-21T17:27:03+00:00" title="April 21, 2011  5:27PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>AfT, thanks\u2014what you say meshes very much with my own experience with one-shots.

In this way, the players know that they are playing a character that is bigger than just this game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321476/#Comment_321476" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-21T20:46:22+00:00" title="April 21, 2011  8:46PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not much to add except to say that JD and Ben are both one to something here, and Gregor summed up exactly how I feel about one-shot characters (and why I find them so much fun to play).

Or, to rephrase: keep searching for the games that will do it for you.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>"Why can't I just decide to fall in love on first sight with this person? Why do I have to get to know them first?"</blockquote>You are not falling in love at first sight; what you need to do is to play a game where the character immediately starts burrowing into your heart. It is possible to make such games.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Harlequin</cite>It's possible, but extremely unlikely.<br/>Maybe I'm being optimistic or nostalgic, but I believe it has happened once or twice.</blockquote>It is unlikely in most games of today. Most of them  are not strong enough, or subtle enough. A few of them are, though, so you should seek them out, and play them. They will give you what you want, as long as other players in your group want it too. We will see more such games in the years to come, and more players will seek the thrill of playing characters they really care for. The development of role-playing games as a form of art has only just begun. It has led to, and will lead to even more diversity in themes and methods. Stronger games with stronger characters, who challenge and hook you, will indeed be included in this diversity.<br/><br/>I've done my share of game-design in this field, and know for a fact that it is possible to design for deep characterization and moving inter-play. I know how to get the same, strong result each time in those types of games. I got the designer-tools to do this in game after game, and some other designers clearly got some effective tools too, in this respect. I reckon there are other ways of doing it too, yet to be un-earthed.<br/><br/>Some advice, based on my experience:<br/>- focus on character, not conflict<br/>- focus on dialogue-techniques, not mechanics<br/>- playing "small choices; big consequences", snowballing<br/>- exploring psycho-social consequences<br/>- exploring human conditions, not genre-trappings<br/>and, especially important in one-shots:<br/>- building characters and relations from first scene to last<br/><br/>So, Jamie: it is not only <i>possible</i> to make one-shots that brings you into deep contact with your character; it is growing <i>increasingly more likely</i> that the next game you pick up will bring you there; into the strong feeling of identification, caring and possible loss/sorrow, with you one-shot character. <br/><br/>Our future hold great games!

Nothing.</blockquote>To me this is all about how a lot of such games are constructed. They make you into a <i>Force of Fate</i>, not a player with the <i>character in his care</i>. <br/><br/><b>As a Force of Fate</b> you get to toy with the character, or actually; his story. Your focus, and "relationship", is with the <i>story</i>, not the character. And at most you will feel clever about it. Feeling clever got no heart in it, and so there is no heartfelt emotions in such games. We are easily entertained, and easily bored by them.<br/><br/><b>As a player with the character in your care</b>, you will strive to make a life for your character, and that simple premise opens up for all kinds of emotions. The character striving to make a good life, and you mirroring his struggles, makes a powerful combination. Good games of this kind will make it easy for you to tap into your heart, and feel for the character. And the feelings will vary, with the luck of your character. The campaign of the old classical games does this, but inefficiently. Still they bring us there; to the golden state of character-identification and care. This is due to them lasting for a long time, so we patch over the weaknesses, and develop a relationship to our character, in spite of the methodical inefficiency. Newer games, both classical and modern, do this in more efficient ways, and thus it is in fact possible to play one-shots, and be deeply engaged by your character. I believe Seth, "thadrine" above here, is one of many that have had such experiences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321561/#Comment_321561" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-22T17:29:20+00:00" title="April 22, 2011  5:29PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 23, 2011 6:53AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Jamie, <br/><br/>Awesome.<br/><br/>So, Dark Fates in MOUNTAIN WITCH:<br/><br/>1) Desperately in Love<br/>2) Past Allegiance<br/>3) Revenge<br/>4) True Motives<br/>5) Unholy Pact<br/>6) Worse Fear<br/><br/>I'm assuming you placed "I was to lose my son to the spirit world" was under Worst Fear?

Or at least mostly GMless.  So we weren't really using the tools as intended. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  But the Witch had made a deal with another PC (me, with Unholy Pact) to bring the child to him in exchange for (corrupted) immortality.  I spent a lot of the game befriending the child, gaining his trust, etc.  But I don't think it really ended up evoking much fear.  Partially because I wasn't completely sure that was Jamie's Dark Fate.<br/><br/>I think the divide Thomas is talking about is really important here.  It kind of ties into the previous divide in the immersion thread.  Looking back at (GMless) Story Games that really seem to have clicked, they usually managed to let the players provide opposition/act as "forces of fate" while allowing the player to mostly be thinking about the "character in their care."  It seems like this could probably work if you were more clearly switching between them (but still mostly in Advocate mode.)  Spending a lot of time in the grey middle ground may be adding to the disconnect Jamie is talking about.  It's hard to keep both approaches in mind at once, and still have enough cycles that you're invested emotionally as an audience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321713/#Comment_321713" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-25T10:00:09+00:00" title="April 25, 2011 10:00AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I should add that I still loved the game, and other tragicomedy games like it.
