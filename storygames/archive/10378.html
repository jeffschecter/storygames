It's painful fun, and I find that the actual interaction &amp; fiction generation we go through in a 9-hour play session is much less than what we do in a 3-hour Archipelago session. <br/><br/>Still, it's sort of fun trying to find the arcane rules in the clunky rules text, not to mention trying to piece together the setting elements. Highlights from last session include the regular "how many scenes do we each get again" hunt through three different sections of the rules, none of which are completely unambiguous; and the question "what is the main religion actually <i>about</i>", which is covered in only two paragraphs in the book in addition to random information buried in lifepaths. (NOTE: I am not looking for long posts with answers to these questions, so please don't post them).<br/><br/>The part of the game I like the best is that the players mostly run it themselves. And there is a perverse sort of fun in seeing how the fiction and the mechanics interact, like a burning weather balloon weighted down by a chunk of Big Ben's internal clockwork.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230798/#Comment_230798" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-09T08:51:59+00:00" title="September  9, 2009  8:51AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To me Burning Empires delivers on all channels, but its sheer size, high player buy-in and a steep learning curve scares people.

I prefer my game texts presented in procedural order like a board game instructions.  First do this, here's ALL the rules for that, then do this and here's all the rules for that.  But Luke's text's aren't organized like that.  They're organized from High Level Overview down to nitty gritty.  That means passing through incomplete information from a procedural point of view.  Like in Burning Empires we're told about the various types of scenes before we're told how to calculate the budget for them.  Procedurally you'd need to do later before you'd begin to care about the former.<br/><br/>And yes, I can further vouch that MG is very straight forward and I suspect that in practice Burning Empires isn't much more on top of it.<br/><br/>However, given that video (to get back to the topic) I suspect that wasn't that guys problem.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230848/#Comment_230848" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-09T12:02:35+00:00" title="September  9, 2009 12:02PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse, I hadn't actually thought of that.

Once I read through everything once and then go back through a second time the lights start coming on...but man that first time through, it doesn't make a lick of sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now I'm thinking about all my game designs, Universalis, Blood Red Sands, Robots &amp; Rapiers (both old and new)...all of my texts are written chronologically...the rules reflect (to the extent possible with minimal forward referencing) the order that  you'd encounter them in play.<br/>\n<br/>\n...which is how most board games do it...<br/>\n<br/>\n...I also had a world of trouble parsing the rules to the board game War of the Rings.

I have struggled with this aspect of GLASS in trying to begin layout and full rules write-up. At the moment, GLASS rules are setup so that one learns ALL the terms, ALL the Calls, and at least has skimmed ALL the Abilities and Limitations and Advantages and Defects... and the last (procedural) chapter is actual character creation. Why? Because it's a points-buy system and one needs to understand the scope of effects and how to tune them to suit a concept before one can, say, make a "Magic Missile spell."<br><br>Similarly, the procedures for play are presented VERY early, so that one know when and how all the elements come into play... because one can totally control initiation of those procedures in most LARPs (i.e. open play). Now, WITHIN an given exchange or use of ability, there's a "procedure," but it amounts to little more than a script, of sorts, for what is done when to activate an Ability and then attempt to hit, after which there's a Response, which is in itself an Ability that might have activation requirements (though not usually) and its own resolution or attempt to hit. In actual play, it become second nature--which is key: these "exchanges" take place in seconds of real-time combat.<br><br>Anyhow... long example to show that, actually, chronological order only works for some (highly structured) games. Others require at least some "info dump" of components so that, later, procedures acting on those components are comprehensible. Finiding the balance... or the "orientation" of top-down or bottom-up is definitely an art form. BE seems (to me) to get that backwards at time--procedures coming as info dumps without all of the components defined; as a result, it can be a tough slog (and, yes, requires two full reads to really grok).<br/><br/>This might be way many games have "tutorial" bit near the front, to get you sort of playing and to teach you more and more elements in the order of core to fringe (or basic to advanced, or minimal and full simulation, etc).                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230899/#Comment_230899" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-09T13:45:23+00:00" title="September  9, 2009  1:45PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jessecoombs</cite>I just wish there was a burning wheel modern or spy that was set up in the same way that BE is, since I'm not a huge fan of the setting.</blockquote>Whoops!

Long answer: I think BE's setting is ingrained into it's ruleset, just the way Mouse Guard's is. I don't particularily know if a swap would work. I guess what I'm implying is that I'd love it if the burning crew gave their attention to a modern-style game that had it's own systems and rules tailored to the setting.<br/><br/>Way off topic here, so I'll shut up.<br/><br/>Back to the OP, BE simply isn't Kurt's game.

Much more modular; you don't have to use Lifepaths if you translate to points-buy (small hack), and you've got plenty of guidelines for tooling up weapons and armor to modern efficacy.<br/><br/>But, yeah, drifting the topic.
