It's GURPS, it's an alternate rome where Ceasar wasn't murdered by the Senate. I'll get into the actual playnext post, but at the moment I want to talk about what I'm bringing to it, and plan to bring too it from indie games and how that's going.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirstly, the two players mentioned above are terrific examples of Vincent's "step up and swing" kinda players, with Doug, my boss, being quite interested in reinforcing the dream as well, so all three agendas are well represented. Once the other two players join the game (they were both indisposed last weekend) I think it'll be interesting seeing how these agendas mix.<br/>\n<br/>\nI explained during chargen that if they put points into something, skill, stat, advantage, disadvantage, that it would come up, and the more they emphasized it the more i would to. Once I explained that if they didn't take swimming, i wasn't gong to fuck them with endless aquatic adventures chargen went much more smoothly.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of self control rolls for disadvantages I started offering experience points for them popping up at interesting moments. this went over well. Joe, the new gamer, was delighted that he could play what his character was about and get yummy candy for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI intend to introduce fanmail at a four fanmail to one xp ratio this friday. We'll see how that goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all, we're having enormous fun, which is good, because I was really worried that I wouldn't be engaged with running something trad for the first time in about two years.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore thoughts later. It's time for work.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218428/#Comment_218428" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-15T08:30:37+00:00" title="July 15, 2009  8:30AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ogremarco</cite>I started offering experience points for them popping up at interesting moments. this went over well.

I'll try to be brief. Gaming stories are best when they're brief annd details should be filled in by questions, not long winded rambles.<br/><br/>We're playing in an alternate Rome where Ceasar wasn't killed by the Senate. Someone convinced him to wait for Antony. It's a year later and Ceasar is embroiled in his campaign against Parthia.<br/><br/>Characters.<br/>Quintus Civilas is the son of a wealthey equestrian, he's a procurator in the city of Massillia. He's an old soldier who campaigned with Ceasar in Gaul and during the civil war. He's got a bad back, doesn't sleep well, and needs a clerk to read to him because of his farsightedness. He's more comfortable with the lower orders than the higher, but his political career is progressing nicely. He's played by the fellow that won't be around until next session, so tight now, he's sort of a cartoony npc.<br/><br/>Koplos is his chief of staff, a Greek slave. He's skilled in both administration and medicine, so he's both the sage and healer in a traditional party sense. He's quite meek and freezes up during violence, the poor guy. He's the most empathic of the group. His player joins us this week.<br/><br/>Polonius is also a slave, a former gladiator Quintus bought to serve as a bodyguard. He's coarse, quarrelsome, not terribly bright when it comes to anything besides killing people, and as oversexed as they come. His player is the newbie gamer, who's doing so well, you'd think he'd been at it for years.<br/><br/>Decius is a former soldier turned collegia turned hired killer. he's deadly, but a good talker as well. His stoic approach to life wars with his appetite for carousing. Think a cross between Titus Pullo and Lucius Vorenus. He also serves to mitigate the utter brutality of Polonius. He's my boss's character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218763/#Comment_218763" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-16T12:07:33+00:00" title="July 16, 2009 12:07PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2009 12:12PM by johnzo.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Ogre--<br/><br/>You've already nailed two of the techniques I've used for perving up GURPS, importing Keys and using all that character sheet stuff as flags. I also widen the scope of task resolution and leave skill selection for any particular task up to the players.  <br/><br/>Say the players' goal is to break into a warehouse.  I'll throw some seed details at them and then ask each character what skill they're contributing.  Someone will pick locks and someone else will climb through windows and another one will use Animal Empathy + Animal Handling to keep the guard dogs quiet.  I'll throw a general modifier at all of them to represent the building's gnarliness and then figure out the various shades of success, complication, and disaster based on the collection of rolls.<br/><br/>Allowing the players to pick their approach gets them talking and collaborating with me and can turn into a nice inspiration escalation spiral where they throw details at me, I throw details at them, they throw them back, etc etc.  I really enjoy that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218770/#Comment_218770" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-16T12:30:30+00:00" title="July 16, 2009 12:30PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice, John, I'll try something like that.<br/><br/>I've also been collaborating with the players to come up with interersting consequences for failure. In the case of an interrogation we decided that success would get the information needed, but failure would add enough time that any ship worth taking would have sailed, and they'd end up tailing the bad guys in a dangerously substandard boat with a dangerously substandard crew.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218876/#Comment_218876" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-16T19:35:22+00:00" title="July 16, 2009  7:35PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With three dice ala GURPS, you can try using the Dice of Destiny hack:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/sample.html?id=1686" rel="nofollow">http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/sample.html?id=1686</a><br/><br/>One die could be "skill", another "fate", a third "time" or "opposition" (I'd roll with Opposition).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlexS" title="AlexS"><img alt="AlexS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img222.imageshack.us/img222/4284/as32px.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlexS">AlexS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219280/#Comment_219280" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-18T09:05:17+00:00" title="July 18, 2009  9:05AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 18, 2009 9:07AM by AlexS.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">With three dice ala GURPS, you can try using the Dice of Destiny hack</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nAndy, since the link you provide is terse, could you perhaps elaborate on the Dice of Destiny hack, and why it is interesting?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219299/#Comment_219299" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-18T10:35:05+00:00" title="July 18, 2009 10:35AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I remembered  one of the things that  made me shelve GURPS a few years ago.<br><br/>The more awesome the thing you want to do, the more likely you'll fail, also shitty grappling rules that are a perfect example of why rules written to be "realistically correct" by people who don't understand the physics of what they're designing suck.

Stuff like:<br/><br/>Skill<br/>Fate<br/>Time<br/>Opponent Skill<br/><br/>etc.<br/>So, say my Red Die was Skill, my Blue Die was Fate, and my Yellow Die was Time: I roll them to chase down someone else on horseback, getting a Red 1, a Blue 5 and a Yellow 6, for a total of 12. In this roll, I fail. But the dice show me that I didn't fail because "I whiffed", rather the Skill die was low so my skill was totally up for the challenge. It's just that ... um... It just so happened that the opponent had a huge lead on me to start off with (time), and also knew the area far more than I do, so he cornered me in a swamp where only he knew the way through (fate).<br/><br/>That sort of thing. It's basically setting colors to dice so you can come up with more reasons for failure than whiffs.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219309/#Comment_219309" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-18T12:40:09+00:00" title="July 18, 2009 12:40PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that, Andy, but I think it might be a little too time consuming for these impatient players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/simjames" title="simjames"><img alt="simjames" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i41.tinypic.com/14kutg3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/simjames">simjames</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219384/#Comment_219384" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-19T03:26:02+00:00" title="July 19, 2009  3:26AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's very cool.

Also, you could go the other way and use the high die to enrich the narration of success! And for pool systems, you could still just use the 3 color dice and add white dice as the pool grows. That way no figuring ratios. You'll still get a success or failure result, then just check the three oracles.<br/><br/>Hmm, s'pose it could get hairy with Star Wars D6;s Wild Die, though.
