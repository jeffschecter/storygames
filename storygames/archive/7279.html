For anyone who is interested in throwing a vote my way my name is Jeramy Ware. I was a judge in 2007, and I've been nominated again this year. The voting margin is narrow, so every vote counts and is much appreciated. If anyone who wants to see the work I that I did last time you can pop over to <a href="http://enniejudge.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://enniejudge.blogspot.com/</a> where I blogged the whole process to see how I do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe voting booth can be found here: <a href="http://www.ennieawards.com/voting/judges.phtml" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.ennieawards.com/voting/judges.phtml</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for any support,<br/>\nJeramy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zacharythefirst" title="zacharythefirst"><img alt="zacharythefirst" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zacharythefirst">zacharythefirst</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161846/#Comment_161846" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-10T22:01:40+00:00" title="August 10, 2008 10:01PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll make my pitch, since I'm running (Zachary Houghton) as well:<br><br>I'm hoping to be honored by your support for one more year. As I did with my threads on here and my work on RPG Blog II, I can promise you that I'll be a voice for accountability, honesty, and good communication for the whole process. I'll need a big, grassroots-style push from everyone I can to have a chance to win, so if you do wish to support me and want to blog it, put it in a sig, or give me an endorsement on the other board, I thank you for helping in giving me a chance to contribute to something that I think can be a positive, fun activity for this hobby. I hope you've enjoyed the work I've done so far, and help me continue in being open and direct with the entire awards process.<br><br>Above all, I hope you take the time to read about all the candidates, and make the decision you feel is best. I know we have other candidates on there who sometimes grace this board, and I hope I get to serve with them. Bottom line, I want to be your elected judge, your point of contact for the ENnies when you have questions, and someone who fights to keep what's working and fix what isn't--and recognize some truly wonderful, deserving gaming products, with an eye towards making sure every product, big and small, gets the best look possible.<br><br/>So, I guess that's my stump time. Thanks, guys, for your time, and I hope to get to demo as much stuff as possible with you all for my liveblogging Gen Con coverage this week!                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_161899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161899/#Comment_161899" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-11T06:09:45+00:00" title="August 11, 2008  6:09AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2008 6:13AM by Graham.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm kinda bored with the Ennies.

Those who did were generally well-received, though I don't believe any "pure" SG products got the nod (but again, they can't win if they don't enter).  Small press in general, however, was <b>very</b> well-represented this year.<br/><br/>If you <i>were</i> trying to wreck the system though, I still like the cat idea.  He could crash with me during the judging process.  Very relaxing, I imagine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_162335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone" title="Quintin Stone"><img alt="Quintin Stone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://rps.net/QS/Images/pipboy-32x32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone">Quintin Stone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162335/#Comment_162335" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-12T19:42:30+00:00" title="August 12, 2008  7:42PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy's got several cats that would make good candidates.
