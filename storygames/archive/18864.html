I've hosted for various scattered groups and always had a good time.  Then I bumped into a new group of Dread players and discovered something strange and scary... they were playing it completely different from the way I had been taught and had then gone on to teach... horrors!  So, once my senses returned, I had to find out more... so here I am.<br/><br/>The games I've played have had a "you touch it, you own it" policy when it comes to pulling blocks: you can look at the tower, move around it, but once you make contact with a block, that's the one you've stuck with.  This has led to a lot of tension via trying really hard with tough pulls or amping up the failure because of many failed pulls.<br/><br/>This other group seems to play with a "probe, then pull" approach where a player can actively check out the tower until they find a "good pull" and then they go for it.  This seems to amp up the tension via "easy" pulls rapidly disappearing and leads to people watching the others probe, hoping for clues as to other easy pulls.  And it sounds like it's still a tense, fun game.<br/><br/>So, my question is, how do *you* play it?  And, as a follow-up, are there even more variations on pulls?<br/><br/>I'm hoping this isn't something Man Was Not Meant To Know!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422354/#Comment_422354" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-02T22:09:01+00:00" title="October  2, 2013 10:09PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've done probe-then-pull.
