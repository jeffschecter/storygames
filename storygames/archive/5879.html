It is a game of \u201cliterary adventure\u201d, which is to stay, in the words of Paul Tevis \u201c<i>League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</i> meets <i>Sliders</i>\u201d.<br/><br/>Awhile back, I started a thread inquiring about the general lack of mention of the game. (The thread is <a href="denied:\u201dhttp://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3982\u201d" rel="nofollow">here</a>.) S-G to the rescue, I got a ton of great ideas. Some of them involve revamping the product page (which should happen in a couple of weeks) and the character sheet (a spiffy new one from Daniel Solis will be available soon). Some of them got collected in supplemental discourse about the game that I will be releasing as a free supplement entitled \u201cAnnotations\u201d.<br/><br/>One of the things I would like to include in \u201cAnnotations\u201d is some additional adventure seeds to demonstrate what kinds of adventures you can have in the game. Now, I can certainly come up with some of my own (and have). But I\u2019d like to get some diversity that can only come from people outside the design process. I saw how well Daniel\u2019s Do letter-writing campaign went and figured I\u2019d call on S-G again. I suspect my request won\u2019t be quite as much fun as that, but I\u2019m hopeful you\u2019ll find a way to make them fun and interesting.<br/><br/>So here\u2019s what I\u2019d love: Whisper me a fully-fleshed out adventure concept that could be used in a <i>Passages</i> game. It should be a meaty paragraph or two such that an interested Narrator would have a good idea of what it\u2019s all about. You could describe a unique encounter or two, but obviously need not be a full outline of an adventure. You could describe a colorful character, location, or item, but obviously need not stat anything up. Please don\u2019t be constrained by traditional notions of what an adventure is. Challenge the game, and by extension, me!<br/><br/>I recognize that many of you don\u2019t own the game, may not know what the game is even about. That\u2019s cool. I think that will result in some wild adventure seeds I hadn\u2019t even considered. Here\u2019s all you need to know: The game is set in the Victorian era, and the central premise is that the literary works of the day\u2014<i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, <i>War of the Worlds</i>, <i>20,000 Leagues Under the Sea</i>, etc.\u2014are true. There are many dimensions beyond our own, many of which form the basis for these great stories. They are accessible via \u201cpassages\u201d circular portals crafted by three rings of power based on the sefirot, the zodiac, and a circle of power (such as a serpent eating its own tail). You can take a look at the intro adventure <a href="denied:\u201dhttp://www.bluedevilgames.com/Adventure-Spooring_of_the_Jabberwock.pdf" rel="nofollow">\u201cSpooring of the Jabberwock\u201d</a>.<br/><br/>By way of incentive, I\u2019ll include the adventure seed in \u201cAnnotations\u201d with an appropriate credit line <i>and</i> I\u2019ll send you a <b>free</b> pdf copy of the <b>full</b> game for your effort.<br/><br/>[EDIT] - Some of you have already responded with (acknowledged) rough ideas. I'm totally cool with that as long as you are cool with me polishing them up. Also, make sure you give me your name or that it's obtainable from your S-G info page.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131597/#Comment_131597" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T08:35:08+00:00" title="February 29, 2008  8:35AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So we're only referencing Victorian literature?

For example, I've referenced The Scarlet Pimpernel, who first appeared in a play in 1903. I've referenced the trials of Hercules, Norse mythology, and Shakespeare. The idea is that the game takes place <i>around</i> 1900, but obviously, there was fiction and passages existed before that time as well. So, to be more concrete about it:<br/><br/>Nothing after, say, 1905. Anything before that is fair game. Anything from other cultures is fair game too. (I've referenced Aladdin, for example, but would love -- apropros to this crowd -- some Asian-inspired ideas.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131623/#Comment_131623" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T09:44:50+00:00" title="February 29, 2008  9:44AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like to help out.

Pretend it's D&amp;D, write something that would help you design an adventure for the PCs. Or, if you prefer, a synopsis on Wikipedia.<br/><br/>As for what the adventure could include, use your imagination. Anything you mention would be fine.

Not six months after the Jack the Ripper murders have ceased, three more prostitutes are killed in London\u2019s Soho district. Scotland Yard wishes to pin them on the Ripper, but one of the PCs notes that the bodies bear two small puncture wounds on the neck and have been drained of blood. Has the Ripper been transformed into a \u201cchild of the night\u201d or is this a new, more sinister threat?<br/><br/>2. Magua seeks bloodthirsty revenge upon those who destroyed his life. His enemies portray him as a savage, but he is cunning to be sure. He kidnaps a loved one of the PCs and coerces them to bring him powerful items from the Book Without End that he might use to destroy Munro and to sate his vengeance.<br/><br/>3. A small beetle finds his way to the breakfast table of one of the PCs. Before it can be squashed, it manages to scrawl in boysenberry jam the following words: \u201cMy name is Gregor. I am a man. Help me.\u201d Investigation reveals that his metamorphosis is the result of an insidious curse by a dark mage from some alternate dimension.<br/><br/>4. The PCs are called assist a friend who owns an accounting firm. He is vexed by his newest employee: He has terminated the gentleman, but the gentleman refuses to leave and simply repeats \u201cI prefer not to.\u201d To the untrained eye, the man might simply appear mad, but a deeper investigation reveals that his insistence is founded on an ulterior motive. He believes the coordinates to a utopian dimension appear in the financial statements of one of the firm\u2019s clients.<br/><br/>5. One of the PCs returns home to find a crazed man ransacking his private papers. The man identifies himself as Ben Gunn and claims that his share of a lost pirate treasure was stolen by Long John Silver, who fled to another dimension in the Book Without End. Gunn learned that the PC has the address of this dimension and promises the PCs an equal share of the bounty if they aid in its return.<br/><br/>6. London. 1893. Renowned astronomer John Tyndall publishes a treatise that warns of a Martian invasion. His peers call him mad. Only his friends and fellow passengers know he speaks the truth. They also know this War of the Worlds will not take place on our Earth, but on a world far more alien than the Red Planet.<br/><br/>7. It has been some time since the French Revolution. However, the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel has only just learned that one of the aristocrats they attempted to save during their heyday was abducted to another dimension of the Book Without End. The PCs are made honorary members of the league and charged with bringing the victim safely home.<br/><br/>8. Baron Munchausen was always thought to be a teller of tall tales. As it would happen, his yarns weren\u2019t stories at all but accounts of his travels through the Book Without End. When an inadvertent journey by one of the PCs confirms the truth, the race is on to locate clues to the address of the dimension he spoke of where diamonds fall from the sky like hailstones.<br/><br/>9. August 13, 1897 marks the opening of the Tate Britain and its breathtaking collection of modern art. However, a lovely day at the museum is spoiled when a throng of grotesque creatures springs forth from the canvas of one of the pieces and from dozens of other passages around the city. The only way to stem the tide is to defeat the morlocks in their home dimension.<br/><br/>10. Professor Abraham Van Helsing has dedicated his life to destroying creatures of the night. After vanquishing Dracula, Van Helsing learns that the creature was not unique. There is another dimension in the Book Without End populated entirely by vampires. Van Helsing enlists the aid of every passenger he knows to help him wage war on the vampire nation.<br/><br/>11. A fiendish doctor from the Orient\u2014identified only by his Fu Manchu moustache\u2014intends to bring down the decadent West once and for all. Favoring spiders, fungi, and other \u201cweapons biologic,\u201d he has collected a rare and venomous species of flying beetle from some far-flung dimension in the Book Without End. To foil his fiendish plot, the PCs might travel to that dimension to find a suitable defense.<br/><br/>12. A young magi by the name of Aleister Crowley experiments in passage construction to horrible effect: He has created a passage to a hellish alternate dimension in the Book Without End that he cannot close. A few mischievous imps have already traversed the portal. An enclave of scholarly magi must track down some long-lost formula to break the circle and protect our world from the demonic threat.</blockquote>\nTo be clear, I'm looking for a little more detail and fleshing out than these.

As mentioned, the only specified components of passages are the three circles. How they are instituted, how they work in action, and what other qualities they might have are all fair game. I do see them as plot devices for both the Narrator and the players to call in in appropriate situations. So, in one demo I run, a new modern painting at the Tate ends up being a passage when the constellations of the zodiac are in perfect alignment. And, yes, passage fishing is specifically referenced in the text, i.e., opening a passage to another world to "extract" a being from it. There is no reason why someone couldn't do the same from their dimension to our world.<br/><br/>JD, your idea is a very neat, and perfectly viable one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132314/#Comment_132314" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-04T10:29:42+00:00" title="March  4, 2008 10:29AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had an abortive campaign inspired by Forgotten Futures which I called <b>The Chronicles of H.G.
