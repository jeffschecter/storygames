I'm also using inherent bonuses with a hope to remove some of the focus on acquiring magic items.<br/>\n<br/>\n[*] I've revamped 4E skills to functionally work the same (roll 1d20 + 1/2 level + trained, etc...), but with an emphasis on Apocalypse World style results. Here's an example "move" I've built for Bluff:<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Fast Talk</b> - You can quickly talk your way out of a situation temporarily.<br/>\n<br/>\nLess than 10, you fail to gain the character's attention and they do not want to hear you speak. They'll usually tell you to shut up and may resort to violence if you don't.<br/>\n<br/>\n10+ Success - you convince the character to listen to you and...<br/>\n<br/>\n15+ Choose 1.<br/>\n20+ Choose 2.<br/>\n25+ Choose 3.<br/>\n<br/>\n*They don't require a bribe.<br/>\n*They don't ask a favor of you in return.<br/>\n*They don't come looking for you later.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are still in very rough form and I'm hoping will be molded and fleshed out during the early portions of the game. And, I'm hoping the players add to the moves and invent custom moves for skills. [/ulist]<br/>\n<br/>\n[*] I'm also planning to steal and invent some AW-like moves for myself as a DM and really steal the Fronts and Countdown Clock ideas from AW. These will replace traditional "quests" and replace them with a more life-like world (I'm hoping to do a very pulp-noir style Eberron game).<br/>\n<br/>\n[*] Without quests, I want to use the "<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://files.crngames.com/cc/sweet20/experience.html" rel="nofollow">Sweet20</a>" Keys XP system from Clinton R. Nixon. My hopes is that this puts some focus on the non-combat scenes and we can develop some roleplaying - especially with regard to the new AW style skills.<br/>\n<br/>\n[*] I want to develop a short "Skill Challenge" style combat resolution (where we don't use the battle-map, but just read the descriptions from the power descriptions and apply them in-fiction), but allow the players to "Bring Down the Pain" - where we zoom in, roll for initiative and begin typical 4E style combat.<br/>\n<br/>\n[*] I'm using custom "death and dying" rules that are somewhat inspired by DitV Fallout - where we roll for death, injury or whatever at the end of the scene. If you wish to peruse those, the "final" version is located <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://community.wizards.com/p1nback/blog/?pref_tab=blog" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm interested in feedback and comments on how you think the mashup might work out, if there's something I'm overlooking, any severe problems you see coming from this type of game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Mike                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269557/#Comment_269557" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-30T09:01:06+00:00" title="April 30, 2010  9:01AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like it's worth taking a shot at to me.
