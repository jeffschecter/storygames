By the time you know what's happened and are making your next calculated decision, it may be all over.  (I'm talking monstrous creature combats and the like here, not honor duels with knightly rules and whatnot.)<br/><br/>I don't want to skip over the decisions you <i>would</i> actually get to make if you <i>were</i> actually there, though.  Even if your blood is pounding in your ears and your vision is narrowed and you're going mostly on muscle memory, sometimes there's some sort of "shock" in a fight that kicks you out of your previous approach.  When this happens, responses may be unconscious (I'd like a system for that, but not sure yet what it'd be), but sometimes they may also be conscious too.<br/><br/>Right now I'm trying to compile a good list.  <b>What are some in-combat events which force or allow you to stop doing what you were doing and maybe do something else?</b><br/><br/>What I've got so far:<br/>- knocking a foe down<br/>- falling out of melee range<br/>- getting knocked down<br/>- getting pinned<br/>- getting disarmed<br/>- having your charge blunted<br/>- getting pushed back<br/><br/>Any other ideas?<br/><br/>Getting your legs chopped off or lungs punctured will also shake things up, but I dunno if you really <i>choose</i> the responses to those.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462355/#Comment_462355" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-23T22:23:01+00:00" title="April 23, 2017 10:23PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about using specific <i>thresholds</i> of high damage impact or going below specific hitpoints/health levels as triggers?<br/><br/>I could also imagine consciously raising the stakes or making a  sacrifice for a special move or bonus ("serious flesh wound puts me in rage mode...").<br/><br/>Other than that I guess anything that impairs your mobility (pinned, arm/leg wound, fractures...) or your vision (wounded eyes, blood trickling on eyes, swollen eyes...) would work.<br/><br/>Personally, I prefer keeping these parameters more abstract, though.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462356/#Comment_462356" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-23T22:35:13+00:00" title="April 23, 2017 10:35PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 23, 2017 10:36PM by David_Berg.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there's some correlation between high-damage impacts and stuff that shocks you out of your combat approach, but there are also some pretty interesting discrepancies.  It's possible for me to hack away at someone without realizing that I just had an artery severed which will kill me in a few minutes.  Same with my opponent.  That imperfect information -- the potential gap between what's obvious and what's important -- is part of what I'm hoping to model.  If it works, I think it might help make combat scary in some unique ways!  Scary, and also possibly hesitant -- there will be options for trying to emerge from the fray exactly so that one can assess what's happened.<br/><br/>"Serious flesh wound puts me in rage mode" probably has a place somewhere in here, but I imagine it as a condition going into the fight which then simply gets triggered or doesn't.  In addition to decision-offering moments, I'll also have to track events which change things automatically, like stuff that knocks you unconscious.<br/><br/>Looks like we're on the same page re: mobility and vision!

Or they've got a big pool of Risk that at any moment could convert into a really nasty wound.<br/><br/>Some maneuvers also deal status effects, which are temporary penalties on the following round like knocking someone down or dazing them, limiting their choices that round on response.<br/><br/>As far as other shock events you haven't listed, hm...<br/><br/>- Reinforcements arrive for your opponents<br/>- You land your ultimate blow and it barely fazes your opponent<br/>- The death of an ally in the battle<br/>- being hurled a vast distance<br/>- A sudden change in weather like hail or a massive windstorm<br/><br/>Don't know if that's the right kind of items for the space you're thinking in, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462375/#Comment_462375" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-24T07:25:54+00:00" title="April 24, 2017  7:25AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK.<br/>I think <i>being poisened</i> is also an interesting one.

You'd have some "instinctual reactions", and inexperienced characters might just have a couple (along the lines of "fight or flee"). However, with more experience and training you could other reactions to the list.<br/><br/>It was intended for sudden, shocking situations. ("A dark figure jumps out of the hedge, and it's about to collide with you! What do you do?") You'd make some kind of Reflexes roll, and that would determine whether you'd get any additional information before making your decision, and if you were limited to your pre-scripted instinctual responses or not.<br/><br/>I never got to finalize the rules or try them, though.

I think tracking unspecified Risk which then later gets resolved into specific injuries is brilliant!  That might be an efficient way to do what I need to do as far as handling the accumulation of unknowns and partial unknowns.  <br/><br/>As for shocks:  <br/><br/>Being hurled, absolutely.  <br/><br/>Landing a blow that you thought would finish the fight, so you're prepared to let down a bit, but then it doesn't?  Totally.  <br/><br/>Major changes to the surrounding situation, such as allies, enemies, and weather?  I'm not sure -- those all seem like things that would register eventually, but many not while rapidly trading attempted death blows?  I suspect those all fall in the class of "things you notice once you have a moment to notice stuff".

Being hurled, teleports, crashing through stuff, having the room flooded, etc.\n<blockquote>I think <i>being poisoned</i> is also an interesting one.</blockquote>Extremely interesting!  I imagine many poisoned attacked would pass without notice, and you'd only find out later... but if you're fighting a giant scorpion, and you know exactly what that venomous stinger does, and you take a hit from it, then yeah, that'll probably hit home that you're in a whole new situation!<br/><br/>Not sure whether that's best handled as a shock or as a trigger for a contingency plan.  After all, if the response is based on <i>knowledge</i> of the poison, then the character would be wise to have an "if I get stung" action cued up.\n<blockquote>Over the pleasant smell of the meadow blossoming in the dew there's a slight stench of rot and petrol. You hear a sound above.<br/>Suddenly you're lying down. Doyle, you're holding your right hand over a big, bleeding flesh wound in your left arm.</blockquote>Cool!  I do think that should be one possible outcome of the system I'm pursuing.  Not a common one... but when there <i>is</i> an epic mismatch, the way it gets resolved could look a lot like that.  Or perhaps even, when there is no mismatch, just crazy luck (e.g. min roll for me + max roll for my opponent)!\n<blockquote>Finding an opening, weak spot or other opportunity</blockquote>I'm not sure what it takes for such a thing to register once the exchange of lethal blows is already in progress -- seems to me more like the sort of thing you notice during a lull.  If something just absolutely screams out at you as an opportunity, though, then yes, agreed!  I guess anything sufficiently surprising counts.  "My opponent's standing in against my sword but shrieking from my silver parrying dagger?!"  That might shock one out of the sword-first plan.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462462/#Comment_462462" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-25T22:31:11+00:00" title="April 25, 2017 10:31PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The main "meat" here, though - and the main challenge - will have to be about what happens <i>in-between these shocks</i>.<br/><br/>How do we create/narrate/navigate those unmechanized bits, and will they be interesting?

And the more experienced the character, the more varied and specialised reactions to these shocks she may have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Years ago, I was putting together a set of rules based on this idea. You'd have some "instinctual reactions", and inexperienced characters might just have a couple (along the lines of "fight or flee"). However, with more experience and training you could other reactions to the list.</blockquote>\nCool!  We're all thinking along very similar lines here.  I was thinking of something similar to this, but with anticipation as an additional factor.  Before the life-or-death situation begins, the characters are generally primed in some direction.  More toward fight?  More toward flight?  Maybe even having a specific plan?  My intent was to factor that into reactions too.\n<blockquote>On a really good roll, you get good detail about what's happening and time to choose your response.<br/><br/>On a fairly decent roll, you only get one or the other.</blockquote>I like that distillation of the relevant considerations!  Very efficient.  Not sure if this is a part I want to leave up to dice luck, though.  It'll depend on what the core decisions are.  "Good detail or controlled response?" is a super interesting decision but I'm not sure if it suits the experiential focus I'm pursuing.\n<blockquote>Also, this somehow looks to me like a system that could actually be turned into one for social situations too. I mean, if you have these triggers and the character have pre-written reactions to these, player can easily select a few triggers for his character that will make him react in certain ways.</blockquote>For normal interactions, I'm not really seeing it.  For life-and-death bluffs under time pressure, though, totally!  (Or maybe even for lie detection and involuntary body language cues, if one wanted to make a system that cared about such things.  I don't think I do, though.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462464/#Comment_462464" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-25T23:08:25+00:00" title="April 25, 2017 11:08PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Exhaustion hasn't been mentioned, I think?
