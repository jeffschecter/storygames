It fits a few of the guys perfectly, and everyone else is willing to try new stuff. However, my experience with running the game has been with 2 to 4 people, not the 6 or 7 that will be in this game... so I wanted to ask if anyone has experience with this group size in Agon, and if there are any special considerations for strife spending or challenges.<br/><br/>My main concern is that with so many people, it will be hard to get solid combats with only a few big opponents (e.g. boss fights)... but that may be unfounded.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135770/#Comment_135770" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-20T20:56:03+00:00" title="March 20, 2008  8:56PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran Agon with 6 players at Dreamation.  We only had two fights, one against minions and one against a monster NPC.  The heroes cut through the minions (just 12, in 3 groups) with ease, so there should have been more or a couple of NPC leaders.  The monster was a tougher fight, but again went down relatively quickly and in retrospect I would add some minions to complicate the battle for the heroes.  The monster was built right at the strife limit.  <br/>Group dynamics worked pretty well, without getting bogged down on courses of action.  When there was a conflict, the players quickly agreed to use Orate to determine who got to make the decision.  <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots" title="dyjoots"><img alt="dyjoots" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots">dyjoots</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135905/#Comment_135905" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-21T22:20:19+00:00" title="March 21, 2008 10:20PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The other major concern I have is the Acheivements for character creation.

In the con game at Dreamation, we used 'group' achievement scenes.  As each player selected a skill, we then framed a scene and used that skill as the basis for a simple contest between all the players.  We decided that the character with the lowest score would owe an oath to the character with the highest score.  I had originally intended that each character would owe an oath to every other character that scored higher in the contest, but as I recall, there was some concern that this was 'too many oaths' and it was slow to determine who owed oaths to whom so we dropped it.  We ended up with just about 6 or 7 oaths awarded (thanks to ties).  I was thinking that that might have been too few oaths, but at least one player thinks it was more than enough, since the players were new to Agon and were learning all the rest of the game as well.<br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136052/#Comment_136052" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-23T15:41:20+00:00" title="March 23, 2008  3:41PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Doing achievements as written is kinda lame. I don't know what I was thinking.<br/><br/>Here's a modification of Mel's method:<br/>The GM frames the scene with your hero and the heroes of the players on your left and right. Play the scene, then the lead player says how they're going to deal with the problem at hand. The GM names the ability, then all three players roll. The losers owe an oath to the winner.<br/><br/>So you only do 7 achievement scenes that way. Also, you don't pick the ability before the GM frames the scene. I think that teaches a bad habit. Instead, you play out the action of the scene for a bit (make it short and punchy) then the lead player says what their hero does to address the issue, and the GM chooses the ability (which is like normal Agon play). Players shouldn't "call for conflicts" or name abilities to roll, as a rule. Instead, they should focus on the actions their hero is taking. So be sure to highlight that during achievements.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
