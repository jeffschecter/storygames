Basically I'm looking for isolated situation elements teased out of these relationships:<br/><br/>Bad Boy Crips (led by Pin "Titty" Chu), mostly Vietnamese vice lords.  Strong ties to Crips.  Hate the Tiny Rascal Gang.<br/>Tiny Rascal Gang (led by Billy Phommasanh), mostly Laotian vice lords.  Strong ties to Bloods.  Hate the Bad Boy Crips.<br/>Flacas (led by Leonardo Fern\xc3\xa1ndez), Central American thugs.

The TRC has already gotten her sold to the BBC for prostitution and was just trying to get the BBC to attack the Flacas for ratting them out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79655/#Comment_79655" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-05T12:44:13+00:00" title="July  5, 2007 12:44PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, that's just the sort of cable-TV gritty/trashy awesome I'm looking for.

She was working undercover, obviously, but RENU denies her as their own. Are they lying? If not, who else is working this area?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
