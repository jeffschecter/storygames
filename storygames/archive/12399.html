And Michael Miller does a fantastic mouse impression!<br/>Memories in A Penny for my Thoughts can only lead to two things: tetanus and daddy issues.<br/>Ryan Macklin runs a mean impromptu game of Dresden. Especially with certain types of liquid incentive.<br/>a/state is my new favorite setting. Steampunk/cyberish crooked cop? I'm so there.<br/>Well, next to Freemarket. Our characters were: a Death Artist (moi), a Singularity Comptroller, an Ethics Aesthetician, and a Genetic Enhancement Enthusiast. Our goal? Move the World Forward.<br/>If you play a horrible, corrupt, and manipulative Meth Queen in Fiasco, you can come out on top!<br/>That Baron Von Munchausen is a viciously successful drinking game. I remember something about Teddy Roosevelt and Jaguars and Slaves in Cydonia and something called a Grindsmistress.<br/>The Kern, being plant frog creatures, have decidedly indiscernible facial expressions. And Luke Crane runs an exquisite game of Burning Empires.<br/>In 1983 America was attacked by Cuban frog women and the Russians, but five unlikely heroes fought for freedom, liberty, and all that other stuff. Best hack ever by Jason Morningstar. What was it called?<br/>Fire is dangerous. Really, really dangerous. So dangerous in fact, that it took the DANGER PATROL to quench it. With our daredevillish fists. And experimental pheromone machines. And flying German robot heads from the future. And, of course, Metal.<br/><br/>In summation, I was balls deep in Origins this year. Good times, good people, good games!                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278275/#Comment_278275" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T08:55:05+00:00" title="June 28, 2010  8:55AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>In the events book, none of Kat\u2019s events listed a GM name or a location. None of the seminars listed a location. None of the events listed a game system. Evidently, this lack of location had been caught shortly before the convention started, but the revised information was not disseminated to anyone we were able to speak to. We spoke to people at GM/event HQ, at RPG HQ, at Customer Service, and we continually got variations of \u201cI don\u2019t know. The person who would know is around here somewhere, but I don\u2019t know where.\u201d This was the beginning of frustration incarnate.<br/><br/>Because of these scheduling issues, ALL of Kat\u2019s games had no players. With no game system listed, people who wanted to try out With Great Power\u2026 or Serial Homicide Unit couldn\u2019t know that the events were in those game systems. With no GM name listed, players who had played in Kat\u2019s games previously could not know that she was running them, and that they\u2019d be fun no matter the game system.

It was three hours down, and then three hours back at the end of the day. And it was always fun. But that was before you could get any game you want from sellers online. Nowadays the value proposition of the show is increasingly concentrated in the game events.<br/><br/>And here Origins is slitting its own throat.<br/><br/>Gamemasters like Kat put time and effort into preparing games to run at the show. This time and effort is a gift to Origins and to the hobby. And year after year they squander this gift through ignorance and ineptitude. <br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278292/#Comment_278292" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T10:06:35+00:00" title="June 28, 2010 10:06AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: anansigirl</cite>a/state is my new favorite setting.

Continues the tradition of combining euro style area control (and a bit of a bidding element) with CDG mechanics to creating a ripping multiplayer voting game that also gives you a lot of interesting historical insight into how the US constitution was written. Must buy for me.<br/><br/>- <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/22510/wings-of-war-miniatures" rel="nofollow">Wings of War</a> with minis and six players is good clean fun!<br/><br/>- I got to experience Burning Wheel ala Thor, playing in the second and third installments of the "Trouble in Hochen" series ('Dinner for One" and "Your Day in Court").  YDIC was especially intense; it was a tight two player (plus GM) game, with me as an idealistic young priest and my companion, an honorable yet landless knight trying to clear our names.  We barely squeaked that out!  Burning Wheel at its finest.<br/><br/>- I ran rip-roaring game of Danger Patrol for Luke, Thor, Dro and Kira, and then got lots of great feedback from them, that I will endeavor to pass on to John. Kudos to Dro for his marvelous characterization of Dr. Ezymon, who managed to harness the most dangerous force in the Universe (Love) to the service of the Danger Patrol.

And I don't mean that in a trite way. When Fred gave me the implicit permission (later made explicit) to ditch my Evil Hat booth duties to run pick-up games, I was fucking ecstatic. I got to hang out and play with people who were way excited about my game. And I owe Greg (the guy who uncorked this, if you will, with his initial offer) for facilitating that awesome.<br/><br/>I lost my GM sheets (left in the hotel <img alt=":/" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":/"/> ) so I can't thank everyone by name, but I remember how awesome my pick-up players were. But man, I am still geeking over the awesome sauce y'all were.<br/><br/>"Big Sword, No Clue" is one of my favorite Dresden Files aspects now, particularly for Wardens.<br/><br/>Obviously, a lot of my "holy shit, that was awesome" moments revolve around our game, since that's much of what I did at the con. But man alive, that Freemarket game that Peter ran for us makes me want to buy it right the fuck now (thus winning his Thin Slicing contest). Seriously, can't we just get a matter printer on that shit? So that's still my "has nothing to do with Dresden" highlight. We played a MRCZ called Ultimate Experiences, involving a Sexual Performance Artist (me!), a Death Artist (which makes two Death Artists this con!) and a Romance Artist. And our handler, a "Social Accountant" -- total Vegas sleaze. It was metal. I should have been tired at 1am on Saturday. I should have been like "man, why didn't I go to bed an hour ago?" But I didn't. I was so pumped[1] after that game that Lenny (playing Vegas) and I went to Barley's for a couple drinks to wind down.<br/><br/>- Ryan<br/><br/>[1] Freemarket will make you invent new sports like Bear-blasting because you'll be too energetic for normal sports.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278445/#Comment_278445" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T23:25:59+00:00" title="June 28, 2010 11:25PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This video is evidence that Macklin = Moses.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278474/#Comment_278474" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-29T07:00:54+00:00" title="June 29, 2010  7:00AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, I had no idea people paid so much attention to the internets! <br/><br/>I told some people at Origins I was on Storygames cause I'm a big dork, and they were like, oh you're anansigirl!

That made it much less annoying. <br/><br/>I did a war college lecture on "How to lose the peace 1815 to 1848" which was fun because I get to gig conservatives. Then I ran "Mongolian Goat Rodeo" and "Thunder Hamsters and the Temple of Cheese" in the board game area. These went well and I got an on line order for a Thunder Hamsters today. Got to do some pre-release runs of the half hour dungeon game I've been talking about on Praxis. Well recieved. I think they will sell well at Gen Con.<br/><br/>It was great fun having Diner with Jason Morningstar and watching him start one of his Fiasco games. The only role playing I got to do was play part of a QAGS game my brother ran ("It's the end of the world Charlie Brown"). <br/><br/>Much of the show for me is about networking. The Founding Fathers game is a good example of that. Jolly Rogers Games is run by Jim Dietz. I met him 12 years ago and used to squat at his booth in Milwaukee before I started having my own booth. I always say hello and trade information. This year I pitched a game to him and he told me which company might go for it if I made a little change. I found out who I needed to talk to at that company and may make the pitch at Gen Con. Networking is not as fun as playing games but if you are wanting to play the "Selling Games game" then it is the place to play it. The "industry" people are not evil and can be very helpful. Going up to the retail lounge is a way of meeting store owners...

My pleasant memory was when my character lost his virginity, dropped out of school, and proposed.  In roughly that order.  And I didn't even get tetanus!  Of course, my wife was killed and I was implicated in the crime, but that still wasn't that bad, all things considered.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mr. Teapot</cite><br/>In<i>Fiasco</i>, my crooked cop never managed to get it on with a freaky Mexican, even though she turned out to not really be his cousin.<br/></blockquote>\nI think my wife was in that one.  Sounds like there was a lot of meth going around? <br/><br/>My other games were Freemarket, where I got to be the Singularity Comptroller (from Mars), and Warhammer, where I was a dilettante.  Warhammer has potential, but it's pretty scattered in its execution.  I need to read 'Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom' before I play Freemarket again.<br/><br/>I usually have lots of fun at Origins, and this year was no exception.

Maybe next year!  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278725/#Comment_278725" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-30T07:23:57+00:00" title="June 30, 2010  7:23AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/fairplay/2010/06/30/origins-2010-roundup/" rel="nofollow">My Origins roundup</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278734/#Comment_278734" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-30T08:31:24+00:00" title="June 30, 2010  8:31AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 30, 2010 8:32AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It didn't go so well for this poor young man:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc4/hs038.snc4/34241_10150230776365433_704570432_13322882_2521870_n.jpg"/><br/>Some cosplay lunatic beasted his jonx.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278793/#Comment_278793" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-30T11:20:27+00:00" title="June 30, 2010 11:20AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://critical-hits.com/" rel="nofollow">Critical Hits</a> has a nice writeup of Jared and Luke's "<a href="http://critical-hits.com/2010/06/29/origins-2010-game-design-is-mind-control-seminar/" rel="nofollow">Game Design is Mind Control</a>" seminar.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
