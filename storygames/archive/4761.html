Here's what I do:  Use Fear 3, Reason 2.  Give the PCs a couple of starting Love points but this isn't necessary if a few of the players are aggressive with Overtures of Affection.  I then write down all the PCs More Than Humans, Less Than Humans, and Connections.<br/><br/>Then what I do is I give each PC an order from the Master that does the follow: 1) Is impossible for the minion to carry out in a straightforward manner because of the limitations of their More Than/Less Than Humans and 2) threatens a DIFFERENT minion's connections.<br/><br/>It's very important that "threaten" here doesn't necessarily mean physically harm.  It could be an attack on something that connection values or otherwise involves bringing unpleasantness to the connection.<br/><br/>Basically, keep repeating the above until Endgame.<br/><br/>Note: Playing this way is not exactly what I call the full My Life with Master experience.  It results in a very frantic game I sometimes liken to 18th Century Paranoia.  But it gets the idea across.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107293/#Comment_107293" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-07T15:33:35+00:00" title="November  7, 2007  3:33PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>  But it gets the idea across.<br/><br/>Jesse</blockquote>\nI would qualify that with a "Barely."<br/><br/>I've now done MLWM a couple of times as a one-shot and it feels more like a Japanese game show than any kind of meaty roleplay experience, something that I feel MLWM capable of.

I HAVE run it in a con environment where the majority of players run around enjoying being manic evil minions for two and half hours (many repeatedly banging their heads on the Horror Revealed Self-Loathing cap) until someone goes, "Oh, so this whole Love thing..." in which case they need the boost.<br/><br/>I've always assumed there must be a more subtle way to run My Life with Master as a one shot.  Personally, I'd love to learn how to do it but my basic con techniques work so well that I don't really know how to do it any other way at this point.<br/><br/>Maybe sometime I'll try asking for a 15 minute break while I go sketch out an actual situation among the connections and try just playing the game as I would with a regular group and just see how far I get.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
