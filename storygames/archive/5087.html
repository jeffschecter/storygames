I'd like to do a Spirit of the Century background with various stages based on what level they get to, i.e.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor each level you have, write a paragraph about a previous adventure your character has gone on.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 1: Backstory<br/>\nWhere do you come from?  Did you know any of the other PCs?  What were you brought up to become?<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 2: First Adventure<br/>\nDid you find adventure or did it find you?  Who was your patron or mentor?  What happened to them?  If you didn't have a mentor or patron, how did you make it through your first adventure?  Were any other PCs involved?  How did this adventure change you?<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 3: Trouble<br/>\nLevel 4: More Trouble<br/>\nLevel 5: Enemies<br/>\nLevel 6: Allies<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't think I"m the first one through this way - can someone give me guidance?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114858/#Comment_114858" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-17T17:05:44+00:00" title="December 17, 2007  5:05PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm doing something similar with Van Dread.<br>I kept Phase 1 as initial background, growing up, family, friends, etc<br>Phase 2 is your first paranormal mission<br>Phase 3 is your last paranormal mission that landed you in the asylum.<br><br>I haven't been able to come up with more phases, but I'm working on it.

Players answer the questions and then select Aspects from among them; as they do so, they'll be adding world details and (perhaps unwittingly) giving me as GM grist for my own Aspect mill.<br><br>1. <b>Why have you come before Mindaemos, the King of Endysion?</b> Has he summoned you into his presence, or have you come seeking audience on your own behalf? Has another sent you as a messenger? An emissary? Do you bear gifts to the King? Do you desire that he mete out justice, or mercy?<br/><br/>2. <b>Which of all his treasures do you desire?</b> An enchanted sword that hangs amid his trophies of war? A map from among the trove of ancient scrolls he has collected from across the Isles? A bejewelled rod crafted in his workshops? Or his daughter, the Princess Filomela, cloistered within his palace?<br/><br/>3. <b>Why do you fear Dosdaemon, the Court Magician of Endysion?</b> Are you leery of his origins in the Benighted Lands? Are you suspicious of his ambitions? Does he seem to exert an unhealthy influence upon the King?<br/><br/>4. <b>What is the name of the place from which you have come, and where is it near?</b> Do you come from one of these places, or somewhere else?<br/><br/><i>The Andalgon</i>. A pastoral region of shepherds and farmers on the large island called Natyros, well-watered by rivers draining from the Aroballa Magys. Its chief city is Onalys, the City of Bridges.<br/><i>Aroballa Magys.</i> The great forest land, home of the brown elves (minalvas). This area is the heart of the large island called Natyros. It is a cascade of serried hills, with cliffs and thickly wooded tablelands overlooking the Andalgon.<br/><i>Elandthal. </i>A small island near unto Endysion. The mariners who live there still revere Madez, the old goddess of the sea, and do her honor in the ancient way.<br/><i>Sundalvallas.</i> The lands of the silver elves (sundalvas). Rugged, mountainous, cloud-topped islands upon which castles are built to command the lowlands and from which silver elves clad for war occasionally descend to scour the land of mortal presence.<br/><i>Valienalvion.</i> The island of the high elves (valienalvas). A mist-hidden isle somewhere amid the Sunlit Sea, it is supposed to hold airy white towers of delicate and filigreed aspect, wherein high elven scholars contemplate the heavens.<br/><i>Omimallas.</i> The lands of the strangers; known also as Mierallas, the Benighted Lands, since the Fire of Analla cannot be seen from these cold barrens upon the far shores of the Sunlit Sea.<br/><i>Chenys.</i> The isle of Chenys in the Benighted Lands is a wild, raw-edged land of soaring mountains and tangled forests, inhabited by a proud and strong-willed people. They are ruled by many petty kings whom they elect at need and who are often no better than bandit-chiefs. The druids of Chenys exert a moderating influence on the excesses of the Chenysi.<br/><br/>5. <b>Who are your people?</b> Are you a Oer, that half-elven race of men whose ancestors came out of the Benighted Lands in time past memory, and were changed by what they beheld? A fair-haired and wild-hearted Lan who\u2019s come from across the sea to settle on the shores of the Camallan Isles? Or are you a dark elf (droghalvar) of black and bitter mien out of Omimallas? Are you a stone-skinned giant from the Munquilanvar or \u201cQuickstone Mountains\u201d? Or a diminutive minalvar\u2014a brown elf of the forest, with merry wits and antic disposition? Or are your people none of these?<br/><br/>6. <b>When in your life was your destiny foretold? Who spoke of it, and what was said?</b> Did your mother proclaim at your birth that you would reclaim your dead father\u2019s patrimony? Did the witch who floated to shore in a boat of feathers when you were a boy touch you upon the head and prophesy your willing death at the hands of one who would love you?<br/><br/>7. <b>What have you brought with you to Endysion?</b> A message from the ruler of your city? A riddle spoken by the old hermit you met in your travels? Nothing but your strong right arm? A company of archers, to war against the Silver Elves?<br/><br/>8. <b>What obstacles did you overcome on your journey?</b> Pirates at sea? The resistance of your family? Your own doubts and fears?<br/><br/>9. <b>What has troubled you in your dreams of late?</b> Did you dream of dragons mere nights ago? Did you hear mocking laughter as you wandered through a labyrinth of stone? Did you see stars fall from the night sky, or a procession of hooded torch-bearers descend silently down a spiral stair?<br/><br/>10.  <b>What is your name?</b> Oerish names have a vaguely Greek sound to them (Mindaemos, Dosdaemon) that you should strive for as well. Male names: Anaros, Babales, Caphryon, Diadaman, Ethalos, Ganathos, Inamon, Luthos, Malamon, Nanares, Ophanon, Pharyos, Rhoparithes, Sanalyon, Termagan, Umaros, Vinamos, Xeles. Female names are similar, but end in \u201c-a,\u201d \u201c-ia,\u201d or \u201c-ana,\u201d so Anaria, Babala, Caphryana, Diadama, Ethalia, etc.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_116103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116103/#Comment_116103" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-23T13:05:04+00:00" title="December 23, 2007  1:05PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just thought of this: Why not set some background stakes around some tasks - things that could have gone either way, and whether or not your character succeeded they still ended up here, but where those events shaped the character's perspective.
