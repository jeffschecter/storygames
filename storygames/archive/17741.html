I'm going to be sending it out to the printer in not too long and am left wondering how many copies I should be ordering and expected to sell later on. I'm working on getting a website with paypal set up, though paypal has been challenging to set up as an ex-pat living in Korea, but I going to conventions or any promotion in other countries outside of Korea is not really doable.<br/><br/>I was hoping for any advice on how to go about distributing and which tools, under which venues one should be peddling ones wares. <a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> mentioned Indie Press Revolution and it sounded like a good idea but they haven't gotten back to me after contacting them a couple days weeks ago. What options are out there and what do you suggest beyond simply offering and shipping it out myself here in Korea? My place here is pretty small and I'm not even sure how big the print run should be and how many I should order in addition or should expect to sell. It's a pretty niche game I think and I don't really have much of a network, especially in the U.S.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TheOtherTracy" title="TheOtherTracy"><img alt="TheOtherTracy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/711/nUY8JIY0C5ZHL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TheOtherTracy">TheOtherTracy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401583/#Comment_401583" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-23T06:07:22+00:00" title="December 23, 2012  6:07AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 23, 2012 6:07AM by TheOtherTracy.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            IPR is pretty much the go-to for selling books. They get to conventions, they have their online storefront, etc. I've sold a few copies of School Daze through them (5 or so) since they started stocking it in late August. I'd contact IPR again, as it's the holiday season, and your email may have just slipped notice. They've been good to work with in my (limited) experience. As well, I sell the PDF through DriveThruRPG, and if your PDF is set up properly (something Daniel can do if he knows to do it) you can do print-on-demand through DriveThru also.<br/><br/>Other than that, I just talk about the game and ask others about it. Twitter, and G+ are my main sources. I have a Facebook account for my business, but it doesn't see much activity. If folks play your game, ask them to talk about it. See if a fan will run it for you at Origins, GenCon, Dexcon, Dreamtion, wherever.<br/><br/>Start engaging with people (this post is a good example of doing so) and you'll be surprised at how your network grows.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401592/#Comment_401592" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-23T09:30:58+00:00" title="December 23, 2012  9:30AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might also look into teachers conferences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401597/#Comment_401597" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-23T10:51:35+00:00" title="December 23, 2012 10:51AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            IPR are worth hooking up with, definitely. <br/><br/>But I've found that the vast majority of my sales come from DriveThru, both in terms of PDFs and also POD books. DriveThru is also a very cheap way of ordering copies for yourself to sell directly to other people (that's where the books I have at IPR came from).

I'm looking into teacher conferences over here in Korea for sure, there does appear to be some interest.<br/><br/>Wouldn't it be more economical to just up the initial print run rather than do POD books; I've already got to print and send out 1000 books so I was thinking of just upping that run, selling some off the website and, hopefully, maybe sending a bunch to IPR as well. I'm printing locally here in Korea, it's actually very cheap but there's the trade-off of having to ship overseas. Still, with a print run of over 1000 upping the print run is probably the more economical choice - especially if I can just ship a bunch over to IPR for them to sell. I'll have to try to get in touch with them again.<br/><br/>Thanks for the replies!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401637/#Comment_401637" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-24T08:27:39+00:00" title="December 24, 2012  8:27AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can actually run the numbers on the print runs and make a rational choice on the risk vs. reward. It's not like the numbers on something like this are complete unknowns.<br/><br/>Just research and approximate the following variables the best you can - the better your numbers, the better your prognosis.<br/><br/><b>How many copies of the game are you going to sell over the next five years?</b><br/><b>How much would it cost to print this number of copies now, while you're fulfilling the kickstart?</b><br/><b>How much would it cost over time for you to print those later sales one by one as POD?</b><br/><b>How well can you afford to commit your capital in books for a couple of years?</b><br/><br/>What a publisher normally does is that he tries to figure a conservative, reliable estimate of that first number (how many copies you're going to sell), and then prints e.g. 150% of that number on the premise that the last copies are cheap enough that you can cover their cost out of profits even if they never sell. The trick here is that your estimate really has to be the realistic conservative number, not a pie in the sky fantasy; tragedies are wrought when enterpreneurs prove unable to distinguish between the two.<br/><br/>Furthermore, by comparing the cost of POD with the cost of the offset run you can find out how many copies you can actually throw away and still end up profitable by going offset. For example, if your offset costs per copy are 20% of the POD cost, this means that as long as you don't print five times as many books as you actually end up selling (that would be a massive mis-judgement, you'd end up sitting on 80% of your print run), the offset is going to be more profitable even if you overshoot your future sales. When you compare this efficiency factor with the reliability of your own estimate of sales, you can find out how large your print run needs to be so that you're almost guaranteed to do better than POD printing would.<br/><br/>(This being said, don't forget the logistical costs involved in offset; for the above sort of calculation you need to distribute the warehousing and fulfillment expenses for your offset print run on a per copy basis, the same as the POD cost calculation does. Also, if you're really professional about your business, you'll factor in insurance: as long as you haven't sold those offset books, it's out of your own pocket if something happens to them.)<br/><br/>My own opinion is that the only real reasons to not do a traditional print run are these three three:<ol><li>You're selectively nonfunctional as a human being, and somehow find yourself able to do business with a POD printer, but cannot do the same amount of work to establish a fulfillment arrangement for an offset print run. If it's simply too stressful and hard for you, while a POD service is easy, then what's a guy to do.</li><li>You don't expect to sell more than 100 copies (or 200, whatever - the exact breakeven point depends on where you print and what you're printing, exactly) of your book within a reasonable time-frame. In this case it's simply cheaper to do POD, as the start-up costs of offset would eat away all of your profits.</li><li>You're so poor that you simply can't invest the several hundred to several thousand rupees that printing several hundred books at once takes. Even if you know that your profits would be better with offset, but the cost of money is too much for you in your situation, then you're forced to use a publishing method that is less profitable.</li></ol>\nIt's probably not a surprise that I suspect POD to be more prevalent than it needs to be, nowadays. Of course every project is individual, but in my eyes the territory between "this project is too small to bother printing it, I'll just publish digitally" and "this project is big enough for a print run to make sense" is really narrow. I mean, if you're selling 200 copies, it's probably already wise to do a print run. And if you're just selling in the dozens, how much work were you planning to put into producing a paper book, anyway?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401643/#Comment_401643" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-24T09:11:38+00:00" title="December 24, 2012  9:11AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wait, you think that POD books cost 5 times as much to make as non-POD books?

You don't want to end up with hundreds of copies just sitting around your house (especially since it will tie up a lot of your money). I would suggest printing just a few hundred extra (like 150-200) at first, since you say printing is very cheap (often times, we tell new designers to print just 100 or so at first). Sell those, see how long it takes you to sell them, and then reprint based on how many you think you can sell over the next year, again being pretty conservative. Then, each year, watch your monthly sales go down (as they typically do for older games, unless you plug into a major market) and recalibrate how many you order for the next year based on current sales and how much you expect them to continue to decrease. It's always better to be surprised by success (and have to reprint) than ending up with books you can't get rid of! Also, it gives you a chance to get used to being a publisher and dealing with any issues along the way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401704/#Comment_401704" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-25T08:10:57+00:00" title="December 25, 2012  8:10AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like sound advice. Only thing is I'm at a point where it would only cost me about an extra $300 for another 500 books. To do another fresh print run of 500 books later on I'd be spending several thousand dollars. My thought process was just to keep a few books to sell off my site and then a couple hundred over to IPR and even if it sells really slowly then at least I won't have to worry about another print run and the monetary risk is extremely marginal. Also, because the kickstarter has just finished I've got the money to do a higher print run - money which I may not have later on if I wanted to do another print run. It'll mostly hinge on IPR though as I simply don't have much space to keep more books even if I wanted to!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401709/#Comment_401709" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-25T09:36:59+00:00" title="December 25, 2012  9:36AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's exactly the sort of particular situation I understood you to have, insofar as the numbers go. Jonathan's advice is good in general, but when you're doing a long print run <i>anyway</i>, it's no great burden to print a few hundred extra copies, even if you're a bit uncertain about the sales and inexperienced. $300 is nothing, you'll cover that with the first two dozen sales. Even if you end up printing 500 copies and only sell 50 of those, you're still making a profit. Maybe it's not quite as much profit as it would've been if you hadn't printed those excess copies, but then that's why it's called risk management. Use the extra copies for marketing if it seems that you have too many, give them out as prizes or whatever.<br/><br/>(My overall tone in this thread is such that it's good to emphasize that Jonathan's rule of thumb "print a hundred and see how it goes" really is good as a a general principle for a beginning indie publisher - I wouldn't want to give the impression that generous print runs were a good idea all of a sudden, after all those years we've talked about having some sense in your publishing dreams. Kyle's situation is just a bit special, as he's already paying the offset press to print books that have been already preordered. At those prices it's just going to be a lot less hassle to print 500 rather than 100, even if it's going to take a few years to get rid of them.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Herman_Duyker" title="Herman_Duyker"><img alt="Herman_Duyker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.starstonedesign.com/mt/img/stealth.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Herman_Duyker">Herman_Duyker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401711/#Comment_401711" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-25T09:59:02+00:00" title="December 25, 2012  9:59AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Doesn't IPR charge for warehousing and such?

In my experience, distributors (including IPR) aren't going to want to carry much more than 50 copies of a new book until they know that can sell through that pile in a short amount of time. So you may find yourself shipping 20-50 books at a time to US (and maybe UK) distributors from Korea, at least at first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401714/#Comment_401714" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-25T11:20:31+00:00" title="December 25, 2012 11:20AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experience with IPR differs, but it's entirely possible that they've tightened their system lately (I haven't sent in new stock for a couple of years, so haven't had reason to notice it). It's still up to Jason Walters and his warehouse, ultimately, so it's worthwhile to ask, at least; it's entirely possible that Jason might allow a larger warehouse load for a foreigner who can't ship more books every quarter. For me, at least, the main reason for why I use IPR for states-side fulfillment is exactly because they've never had any trouble warehousing basically the entire print run of whatever I've done. And I'm not even an A-list seller, for those it'd be a no-brainer to take the books, what with the way IPR profit-sharing works. IPR doesn't quite work like a distributor in this regard, as they're more committed to the long tail, as befits an indie-focused warehousing/fulfillment/webstore service.<br/><br/>Also, now that I think of it, if you need/want separate fulfillment for Europe, we can talk about that. There's no reason why I couldn't do some indie fulfillment for others as well, considering that I have to maintain this small logistics routine anyway for my own stuff and the webstore. No idea why I haven't started selling the service, maybe there just isn't enough demand for European small press fulfillment <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
