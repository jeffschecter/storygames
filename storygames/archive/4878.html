I set myself a goal a few months back: see what i could do to come up with pentagonal-based Lego designs that are small enough to build Mechaton mechs off of. I figured out the basic body structures fairly quickly, and had several of them with me at Gen Con, where i got to play. Equipping the rest of them took a little while--i always seem to blank on coming up with new weapons that actually look cool. But the real delay is i don't have a digital camera, so this had to wait until i could borrow one. So, finally, <a href="http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?f=286708" rel="nofollow">here they are.</a> And several of them are in the same scale as Vincent's original mechs--the flying one, the two squat ones (based on hollow pentagons), and maybe the green one (it's on the verge). The rest are really too big, though it's not much of an issue until you start dealing with melee range--well, except the big tan one, which is just ridiculously huge, but i had too much fun building it to just toss it. <br/><br/>[continued...]                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/woodelf" title="woodelf"><img alt="woodelf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/woodelf">woodelf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109467/#Comment_109467" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-24T10:18:20+00:00" title="November 24, 2007 10:18AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This post is now going to geek out on Lego technicalities, so you can skip it if you don't care. I found at least 6 distinct ways to produce pentagonal structures, more-or-less. Each of these uses a different one, or at least a different variation. The tall spindly guy is truly pentagonally-symetrical, constructed as a pentagram, except with bent arms linking the points. And, other than the cockpit (which can swing through about 90deg), it has no preferential direction.<br/><br/>The big tan spider-like one is a proper pentagon, but there's nothing but friction keeping it that way--pull a little too hard in the wrong direction, and it'll easily bend out of shape. Also, despite appearances, the turntable that the cockpit and gatling gun are mounted on isn't actually centered on the body--though it's pretty close. The arms underneath aren't centered at all. <br/><br/>The basic structure of the green camouflaged guy is pretty much the inverse of the tan one--a 5-pointed star instead of a pentagon. But it's mostly forced to stay in an equi-angular state by the hinge sticking up from the middle that the cockpit is mounted on. Other than the arms being mounted a tad off-center, it, too, has no preferential direction.<br/><br/>The red five-cockpitted one takes the same basic star structure of the green one, but builds it with a different type of hinge. Coincidentally, this ends up being one of the very stable structures, because the maximum bend on those hinges is almost exactly 72deg, so they basically can't bend any more, so there's no give. And, through a happy coincidence, one of the angles on a 2x3 wedge plate is also very close to 72deg, so it's possible, with a bit of finagling, to tile the star structure with a mostly-continuous surface. Though i haven't yet found any useful lengths to bridge between the various panels. Since i didn't have enough of the appropriate plates left in any one color, you can see them pretty clearly where they meet in the middle, in one of the photos (after i removed the scratch-built turntable). Instead of rotating within itself, this one takes the approach of having arms, legs, and cockpits pointing in all 5 directions--and two arms can be brought to bear in any given direction.<br/><br/>The two white ones take the same hinges as the red one, and invert them--so they're basically analogous to the big tan one, in core structure. Except the smaller one is stabilized by finding just the right pieces to wedge in there so that the structure doesn't move without something giving first. This one, despite the pentagonal core, is pretty much designed like a standard mech, with all the stuff mostly facing in one direction (though the arm has a lot of swing and multiple joints).<br/><br/>The larger one, in turn, is actually structurally sound. I was amazed to find that the technic bits i stuck in there perfectly meet, and there is essentially no movement possible. And it provides a perfect place to mount a stalk for the cockpit, and numerous hardpoints for attachements. Or, if i had the parts, i could probably tile it like the red one--it's about the right diameter. I again used the solution of rotation, though this time just the cockpit, so it might need to change facing to bring certain weapons to bear, but not for travelling.<br/><br/>The remaining two are pentagonal, but not symmetrical at all. The beetle-like red and tan one uses click-hinges, which simply cannot be configured into a regular pentagon, no matter what. But they will form a stable, if lopsided, pentagon. So i built something with definite directionality that takes advantage of the rough bilateral symmetry of that form--and a mech where everything is at one funky angle or another.<br/><br/>Likewise, the technic angle connectors are great, but there's no combination that'll give you a pentagon, much less a symmetrical pentagon, at small sizes. So i just left one side off the pentagon, so it's not obvious that the 5 points there don't actually define a regular pentagon. And came up with a flying mech that attacks from above with dual dual-canons and a giant tentacle.<br/><br/>So, hopefully this will inspire some other Mechaton fan, or turn someone into a Mechaton fan. Or, hell, just get someone to pull out their Legos and play with them for a while. ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109473/#Comment_109473" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-24T12:21:48+00:00" title="November 24, 2007 12:21PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Success!
