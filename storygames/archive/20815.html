One player takes on the role of Candidate Adam, a major figure in US federal politics. The other player takes on the role of the Commentariat. Each round consists of the first player making some remark which in normal contexts would seem utterly monstrous, insane, or just plain evil. Player two then finds  away to \u201crepackage\u201d said remark in a way that would make it appealing to the American cultural mainstream.<br/><br/>Examples:<br/><br/>Player One (CA): \u201cY\u2019know what would really improve this nation\u2019s landscape? Setting fire to all the churches!\u201d<br/>Player Two (Com): \u201cLiberal elites want to regulate firearms, fireworks, househould uranium refinement, and seatbelt use in cars, because of so-called threats to \u2018public safety.\u2019 But we say: let freedom ring!\u201d<br/><br/>Player One (CA): \u201cI ate an entire human child for supper just last night, cooked into a delicious ragout.\u201d<br/>Player Two (Com): \u201cHitler was a vegetarian!\u201d<br/><br/>Now you try!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457001/#Comment_457001" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-10T15:35:48+00:00" title="October 10, 2016  3:35PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "People are so meek and docile these days.
