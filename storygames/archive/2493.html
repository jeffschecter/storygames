                    So, suppose you win a roll, and that gives you an extra die that will help you to win future rolls (which will, in turn, give you extra dice to be yet more likely to win future rolls)?  That's a positive feedback loop, often called a "death spiral."  On its own, this will tend toward extremes.<br/>
<br/>
But <i>now</i>, suppose that you get to choose, on each roll, whether to stake those extra dice.  If you stake them and win then you keep them (and, as always, get another extra).  But if you stake them and lose, they all go away.  You only get to keep them as long as you keep winning.<br/>
<br/>
If that's strapped to an economy system that lets people (particularly your opposition, but also you) manage other resources ... that's no longer a simple death spiral, is it?  What strategies and responses do you think such rules would evoke?                </div>

                            If the risk of total loss is high enough with each roll, the decision making gets really interesting.  If it is relatively minor, I'd guess that the net impact would be very small - people would charge ahead with the acceptable risk.  Not sure where that break point is.<br><br>The "go - no go" imperative reminds me of blackjack, and I'll bet there is a metric assload of blackjack tactical discussion out there.                        </br></br></div>

                            Hello Tony,<br/>
<br/>
That's how the Pool works, right? The adjacent economy being the in-game events. Or am I missing something?<br/>
<br/>
You can use the size of the player's Pool as an indicator for what future scenes will be like (and thus help pace play):<br/>
If a character is imprisoned when he has lots of dice, you can count on a nice attempt of escape.<br/>
If a character is imprisoned upon pool depletion, you can bet he is going to be tortured a while before he gets back his dice and makes good his escape.                        </div>

                            Isn't that basically how "Cat" works? If you get more successes then you need, those successes turn into style dice. You can add style dice as additional dice to a roll and if you get more successes then you need you get those back as style dice.                        </div>

                            Graham:  It would certainly play differently with different systems of totally up victory (because, as Jason points out, how big an influence the extra dice provide is a big factor to what strategy the structure provokes).<br/>
<br/>
The system I'm thinking of combining it with is "high die wins, followed by next high die in case of ties, all the way down."<br/>
<br/>
My experience is that this has a taper-off effect, where the difference between (say) two dice and one die is <b>huge</b>, but the difference between eight dice and five dice is ... not so huge.                        </div>

                            I have always heard the 'death spiral' as being more explicitly a negative feedback loop - failure leads to more likelihood of future failure. I think what you're describing is more of a 'combo' system than a death spiral. <br><br>One of the most weighty criticisms of 'death spirals' (in the negative sense) that I've seen is that your choices decrease drastically with even a small misfortune. "Can't win" becomes the same as "can't break even" and "can't quit the game" eventually. Whereas a bonus leading to more bonuses, I would think, increases choices at every stage.<br><br>I just can't wrap my head around 'death spirals' being bonuses. Sorry. You're spiralling TO death, not away from it.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I have always heard the 'death spiral' as being more explicitly a negative feedback loop - failure leads to more likelihood of future failure.</blockquote>That's a positive feedback loop.  It's not "negative" or "positive" in value-judgment terms ... not "bad" or "good."  It's mathematics ... whether it's feedback in the same direction as the original action, or in the opposite direction.  So a negative feedback loop would be that failure leads to <b>less</b> likelihood of future failure.                        </div>

                            Well, besides the decision of whether and how much to stake, there's also larger game issue.  I think this sort of "reward for success" encourages seeking out minor challenges (i.e. those with a high chance of success).  <br/><br/>This is what I observed in my game of <i>Don't Rest Your Head</i> -- as long as we got easy challenges to "recharge" with, we could keep going forever.  This isn't necessarily bad.  The same thing is also true of <i>James Bond 007</i>, which I like a lot.  There, the system gives you a Hero Point for what is essentially a critical success -- so it encouraged you to use your best skill regularly to do easy tasks.  In-game, this means showing off, i.e. gambling, driving fast, etc.  Showing off made you better at later heroics, which I thought fit the genre quite well.                        </div>

                            If your pool is a "a roll of X on each die is a success" sort of deal, you might achieve some cool effect with the individual bonus dice where a bonus die is lost if is comes up a failure -- a sort of "blunting your edge" deal.  This isn't an all-or-nothing situation, so it might not been what you're looking for.<br/><br/>A neat twist on this idea (I think):  You lose the bonus dice when they come up as successes.  Shoot, I think that's more interesting than loss based on failure.                        </div>

                            Well, regardless of whether the negative in negative feedback loop refers to the loop or the feedback, "winning makes you better at winning" is a really different thing from "losing means you'll keep losing". The former is what you're talking about in the original post, and the latter is what everyone else means when they say "death spiral", and the criticism is that the latter removes choices, which clearly doesn't apply to the former.

                            JD has a point. In terms of colloquialisms, a Death Spiral is a feedback loop where failure reinforces the chances of overall failure. The lesser known colloquialism for the effect where winning reinforces winning is the Steamroller Effect.<br/>
<br/>
Possibly the best know example of the Steamroller Effect are in "StratCon-like" games (such as Warlords), where capture of resource points allows you to create more troops, and thus capture more strategic points, etc, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Note that it's easy to assume that these two effects are simply the converse of each other. But that's not always true. That is, in the example of the games that I cite above, losing a city doesn't penalize the player in terms of what the rest of his production is like. In fact, the Collapsing Ballon Effect may mean that he's proportionally better off than he was with the other strategic point in hand. So, while the Steamroller Effect is in play for the player taking the strategic point, the Death Spiral is not in effect for the person taking the hit.<br/>
<br/>
If it were, then these games would likely be unplayably bad.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the term for the point at which success or failure becomes assured, or nearly assured, is the Point of No Return. In a "strat-con" type game, often the game will end when one player captures a simple majority of the strategic points, because, barring very incompetent play, that's a Point of No Return. Playing beyond that point is largely pointless.<br/>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>So, suppose you win a roll, and that gives you an extra die that will help you to win future rolls (which will, in turn, give you extra dice to be yet more likely to win future rolls)? That's a positive feedback loop, often called a "death spiral." On its own, this will tend toward extremes.<br><br>But<em>now</em>, suppose that you get to choose, on each roll, whether to stake those extra dice. If you stake them and win then you keep them (and, as always, get another extra). But if you stake them and lose, they all go away. You only get to keep them as long as you keep winning.<br><br>If that's strapped to an economy system that lets people (particularly your opposition, but also you) manage other resources ... that's no longer a simple death spiral, is it? What strategies and responses do you think such rules would evoke?</br></br></br></br></blockquote>
Well, I think this is broadly how Ars Magica combat works.<br><br>Combat involves opposed rolls, if I win the roll then I have an amount by which I beat the other guy.  I can now choose either to apply that immediately as damage from which armour will be subtracted, or to carry it over.<br><br>If I carry it over, it gets added to my next opposed roll next round.  If I win that, I have a new total excess which again I may choose to apply in damage or may carry over again.<br><br>I can do this indefinitely, I can keep carrying over as long as I keep winning the opposed contests, but the moment I lose one I lose all my carryover.<br><br/>The idea is to allow a guy with a dagger to take down a guy in platemail, if the dagger guy is way skilled.  He keeps round after round accumulating his total until finally he has so much that he uses it and wastes plate mail guy, otherwise his dagger just wouldn't do enough damage.  In game, it represents tiring out platemail guy and gaining positional advantage until he is effectively helpless.<br/><br/>How does it work in actual play?  Quite well in my experience, players judged the benefit of further accrual against the risk of losing accrued benefit, if they figured they were better sometimes they would accrue so as to hopefully take their opponent down in one fell strike.  If it was more evenly balanced, they'd try and wear him down round by round.  It introduced a simple, but quite satisfying and evocative, tactical element to play and made combats more interesting than otherwise might have been the case.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            In the system you're talking about, you can walk away from the cycle of risk any time with a quantifiable advantage.

                            Suppose the <b>only</b> way you could apply damage was that you could win the combat if you accumulated a success-advantage equal to or greater than your opponent's total hit points.<br/>
<br/>
But if you were five dice up, and his hit points were six, you were still <b>obligated</b> to make another roll that risks putting you all the way back down to zero.  You can't hit him for five of his six dice, and then hang in there, hoping to squeak out a one-die advantage somewhere along the line and finish things.<br/>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>Well, besides the decision of whether and how much to stake, there's also larger game issue. I think this sort of "reward for success" encourages seeking out minor challenges (i.e. those with a high chance of success).</blockquote>
Now what does that entail when you're always in versus conflicts?  As, for instance, in games where the wall you're trying to climb is an avatar of the GM, who is pursuing their own agenda with their own dice pools, rather than simply assigning you a difficulty that seems fair?<br>I don't think opposed roll versus difficulty number makes a difference to my point per se -- the point is that in a system where success directly benefits you outside of that conflict (i.e. like Don't Rest Your Head or James Bond 007), that this encourages you to seek out easy successes.  That could be picking on weaker opponents or attempting simple tasks.  <br><br>I'm not sure exactly what the system you're talking about is like, but it sounds similar to these in principle.  <br><br/>I can think of some ways to mitigate this (i.e. seeking out easy successes), but mostly they just seem to be weakening the feedback loop, which is basically defeating the purpose.  One way around this might be to throw out the concept of opponent strength or task difficulty, like <span style="text-decoration: underline;">My Life With Master</span>.  A Violence roll is the same regardless of whether you're facing a vicious cat or a squad of soldiers.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            John:  I agree that you can seek out easy successes by picking on weaker opponents.  I guess what I'm saying is that that's a qualitatively different thing from attempting simple tasks.  It has more social repercussions.<br/>
<br/>
If you're trying simple tasks with massive advantage then you're a show-off.  And, as you point out, in some systems that's perfectly cool.  Even in systems where showing off isn't the norm, the worst you're going to be accused of is being flashy and arrogant.<br/>
<br/>
But if you're targetting weak players and attacking them with massive advantage then you're a bully.  And that has social repercussions, which I think feed back into what happens in the rest of the system.<br/>

I'm reminded, particularly, of playing old style <i>Illuminati</i> ... a game in which everyone was ALWAYS keeping a very, very close eye on the Bavarians and the Gnomes of Zurich (the two most blatantly powerful factions) ... and in which, as a consequence, the people playing those roles very seldom had a snowball's chance in hell of winning a game.                        </div>

Well, that depends what the roll is, right?  An opposed roll isn't necessarily attacking or bullying.  For example, if I win an archery tournament handily, I'm not bullying the less-skilled contestants, but it's still an opposed roll.  Other ones might be spotting obvious lies (i.e. Detect Lie vs Deception), slipping out of the house (i.e. Stealth vs Perception), and various others.  Your original example was that the wall you're trying to climb is an avatar of the GM, where it similarly seems hard to call climbing a wall bullying.  <br><br>I guess the question here is what behavior you're trying to encourage.  If the system rewards easy successes and you're trying to mitigate it by the social repercussions of being called a bully, then maybe you should change the system.                        </br></br></div>
