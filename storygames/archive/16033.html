Real artists ship, so here it is. It's one side of one page.</p>\n<p>The game is based on my own reflections on the more tender moments of adolescence from the vantage point of young adulthood. I'm not an experienced freeform guy, so the mechanisms of scene pacing are mainly inspired by Fiasco (which I've played) and Silver and White (which I've just read, and which also provoked my desire to create a quiet game like this in the first place).</p>\n<p>Would love to know what people think. Especially would like to know if there's different things you'd place on the list of settings. Or if you play it and desperately want another scene. Or if you do something really cool with your Alone scene. Or anything like that.</p>\n<p>Actually the thing I want to know most is what people who weren't on the internet at age 13 do with the Online or On the Phone scene. Is being on the phone in whatever pre-ubiquitous-AIM time at all analogous to hanging out online? Should I delete that option? Really don't want to make an important part of the game inaccessible to proper grown-ups.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/StephaniePegg" title="StephaniePegg"><img alt="StephaniePegg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/185/n6ACKVL4YBWQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/StephaniePegg">StephaniePegg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365422/#Comment_365422" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-05T18:58:22+00:00" title="March  5, 2012  6:58PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I liked it, just reading it.

But that dynamic doesn't really fit into the game as I've written it, since a scene ends as soon as any one character leaves it. Which is why I don't know how the Online scene translates to phones, since even a three way phone call in your house might not be safe and private in a way that a group chat can be. Did you need fancy equipment to have a three-way call during the peak years of teenagers-tying-up-the-phone as a cultural Thing? Is it ridiculous that this is the part of my game I'm most concerned about?</p>\n<p>(I think not, because the Online scenes [we repeated online] were really great in the game that we played, and Online is probably the most private setting in the list, and in groups of three or four allows for sidebar/one-on-one conversations with the least fictional friction. But people even five or ten years older than me might not have had extensive AIM chats with people they were intimate with in middle school. Actually people ten years younger than me might not have that experience either, but they can write their own game when they grow up.)</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365446/#Comment_365446" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-05T22:41:24+00:00" title="March  5, 2012 10:41PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice!<br/><br/>I like "avoid NPCs".

If the players all share a general technological era they can probably figure it out organically; there's more likely to be uncertainty about how to treat the scene if players are of various ages.<br/><br/>The Alone scene variant is great. I almost want there to be a limitless number of such Alone scenes. Or just some other game where the main thing everyone is doing is keeping private journals and never sharing them until the end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365509/#Comment_365509" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-06T10:11:52+00:00" title="March  6, 2012 10:11AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is sweet.

That might be interesting.<br/><br/>And I like the way that On The Phone could mean multiple conversations happening at the same time, perhaps with 2 pairs (this seems like a game best played with about 4 players).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365534/#Comment_365534" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-06T12:08:43+00:00" title="March  6, 2012 12:08PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And from reading the scene list, my favorite is Dawn.

How did the differing time between scenes work out?</blockquote>\nWe played the seven scenes with the time gaps as I wrote them in the rules, yeah. Basically what happened is before we knew it we had played the first four scenes (today, tomorrow, this weekend, next weekend) and only had one scene left before we jumped ahead a year and our characters became very different people. I think perhaps the game could stand the additon of one more scene before "next month" but in general I got the effect that I wanted out of having the timeframe shift like that. Namely that we're playing to examine a moment in our characters' lives that is going to disappear really quickly. Having the moment disappear quickly in play prevents a "plot" from developing (as one of the other players pointed out) and keeps the game focused on the conversations the characters have and the feelings that they're dealing with. Our Five Years from Now scene happened to be our Dawn scene, and as a result it was a pretty positive ending, with the characters on the stoop fretting about college apps and reminiscing a bit. Curious what would happen if the last scene of the game ended up being Alone; I think that'd be a more painful ending.<br/><br/>If anyone gets a chance to play Grace anytime from now till forever, I'd love to hear how your game goes!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_365570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365570/#Comment_365570" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-06T15:26:56+00:00" title="March  6, 2012  3:26PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's nice.
