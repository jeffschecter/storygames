I balance this against the current broad economic environment and give it my best guess. <br/><br/>Of course with creative ventures this model breaks down somewhat, since the cost of production is somewhat subjective beyond any explicit costs (printing, hosting, distribution, etc). That leaves it much more to personal preference than a specific formula.<br/><br/>For me personally I have a big problem paying more than a few dollars for something I don't have a physical copy of in my hands. Yeah, I can print out a digital product, or save it to cd or such, but that's never as good what you get when you buy a physical product.<br/><br/>I guess I'd say $1-5 for a digital download (scaled based on amount of content, quality, etc), up to $5-10 for a small physical book/booklet, and up to $25-30 for a major production (i.e. I would NEVER pay more than $30ish per volume for say, D&amp;D or Shadowrun, except as a collector item).<br/><br/>Of course this prices me out of a lot of markets but then again today's reality prices most people out of a lot of markets, so I guess it's par for the course.<br/><br/>I should also point out that many disagree with the 'assigning a price gives it value' line. While many people seem to exhibit agreement, many people are also heinously stupid, so I'm not sure prevalence is a particularly good indicator of anything positive. Then again, I'm a lifelong Unix/Linux user, so maybe I really am just a weirdo.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442826/#Comment_442826" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-13T20:40:53+00:00" title="February 13, 2015  8:40PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 13, 2015 8:41PM by James_Stuart.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think the Linux/OSS thing has as much value here: a lot of the reluctance there is kind of enterprise level decisions of whether to invest in a technology.<br/><br/>Pay What You Want/Free games will always get your game into more hands. But if it's actual exposure and people running that you want, you've got to do the work in building boosters for your games. Some of the cheap to free ways to build this is through being a name, existing boosters of the game system, the high concept ("you're in a giant robot and you punch giant monsters hell yeah!")<br/><br/>My wager is that in this game's case, none of those are going to really help you that much. So it's a lot of just the hard work of you playing your game with other people, bringing it to cons, playing it online, and just promoting it and your name. This works!<br/><br/>Burning Wheel was in the absolute worst set of beginning circumstances (fantasy D&amp;D-esque games with new complicated systems that are from somebody nobody knew) but with just <del>a little</del> 8-10 years of concerted effort, they climbed that hill. <br/><br/>Your hill isn't nearly as big and your goals may be more modest!

The price point does not matter for getting people to actually play anything, but making it free does make sure that you don't miss any potential players.<br/><br/>Alternatively, have a price point and spend the money generated by sales in further moves that increase play. An absolutely crude example of the principle would be to set aside all sales money and award it as a quarterly prize to the best actual play report about the game; this would presumably increase play in the same way that declaring a drawing draws people into a general store.<br/><br/>I don't know which of the above approaches is more effective; probably depends on what, exactly, the steps are that one can take to increase play. If there's some no-brainer moves priced at $200 for example, then it probably behooves you to generate that much money to put into that.<br/><br/>As for general name recognition and "buzz", I have only one advice: never is too soon to start, and there is no actual timing effect to buzz, despite what Hollywood executives would have you believe. The sooner you start with relevant and interesting communication, the more venerable and familiar the project will grow to potential audience in the time span between the start of marketing and the publication date. So wait only as long as it takes you to put together whatever marketing strategy you want to use, and start using it - no need to wait for covert art to finish or any such external standard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442839/#Comment_442839" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-14T01:20:21+00:00" title="February 14, 2015  1:20AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm no expert on this, but I would say:<br/><br/>* There's never any reason to delay talking about/generating buzz for your game.

I've become rather skeptical of the idea that people are more likely to play something that they paid for, myself. I think people becoming invested in something takes more than that.<br/><br/>If there is one thing that seems to encourage more people to play a game, it's seeing it being played. Or hearing it, or reading about it. Seeing a nice-looking book makes people think "I want to buy that," but witnessing a game being played makes people to say "I want to play that." Even just posting actual play threads. It also has the added bonus of being a way to shill for your game without acting like a salesman.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord" title="SquidLord"><img alt="SquidLord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/690/n6I44LRPBAB7W.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord">SquidLord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442873/#Comment_442873" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-14T18:55:31+00:00" title="February 14, 2015  6:55PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like pay-what-you-want as a price determinant in the RPG market. Especially for games which have minimal overhead in their production costs and which can be distributed for effectively nothing, PWYW catches the right balance of wanting people who don't have a lot of resources to have the choice and ability to have your creation without feeling like you are taking away the choice of those who have already decided they want to support you and what you're working on in a bigger way.<br/><br/>Once you start working on things with serious costs, real overhead, you have to start setting some baseline cost on the product. That's just a <i>necessity</i>. That doesn't mean that you can no longer accept PWYW as your preferred mechanism of engaging with the market, it just means you have to set a lower bound on what you're willing to accept. For those seeking ideological purity, this is about as good as it gets.<br/><br/>But that's just talking about getting a game. If were talking about wanting a game and playing a game, Johnstone is exactly correct \u2013 the best way to cause that, the best way to getting engaged in that happening is to make sure that people can see it happening. If the community you would like to cultivate is local, that means showing up to every local convention and to every game store games day, making sure that you are on the GM list (or whatnot), and making sure that a game is played and it's done as well as you can possibly manage. If you want a more global audience, you need to work out how you can get some videos of actual gameplay of your game on YouTube, but beyond that you need to get involved in communities online who have a thematic interest in the subject of your game. That is definitely not just RPG-centric communities.<br/><br/>If your game is about high action kung fu fighting, go talk to some people who are into kung fu action movies. If your game is about Napoleonic historical warfare, find some communities that talk about Napoleonic-era historical reenactment.<br/><br/>Ultimately, you want to go where the people who are most likely to be interested in the subject and themes that you're presenting are hanging out. You don't want to just dive bomb the place; you've got to spend enough time interacting with people there to be considered "one of us," <i>not</i> just someone who is coming through to advertise their product and then goes away. You need to be part of the community before you can talk to the community.<br/><br/>You do that, people will be interested in what you have to offer. If you can show them how what you have to offer works, how it connects to something that they need, or something that they want, or something that they already do \u2013 you're already 7/10 of the way to having your game in somebody's hands and making them very happy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442874/#Comment_442874" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-14T19:14:13+00:00" title="February 14, 2015  7:14PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/>Of course with creative ventures this model breaks down somewhat, since the cost of production is somewhat subjective beyond any explicit costs (printing, hosting, distribution, etc).

I spend as much time thinking about a thing as actively writing it (and twice as much researching as writing anything). If I'm sitting at the computer contemplating, or fiddling with bits, is it time invested? What about thinking on a walk to the coffee shop? After all, I'd do it anyway. Moreover I frequently juggle a half dozen things at once, so I'll be sitting writing something and suddenly solve an issue in something else, so I'll switch over real quick and write 5 pages of that, then shift back. Is a draft the same time as writing final copy, because I usually draft while watching shows or hanging with friends, etc. Are playtests work time or play time? I could go on, but you get the idea.<br/><br/>In my experience the creative process doesn't lend itself to an hourly rate. Especially since some things are worked on over the course of 5-10 years (though to be fair, none of those projects are things I'm looking to sell). For many I talk with creating is something we have to do, not something we choose to do for employment. Because of that it's often difficult to assign a direct value to the time spent on it, because it's just how we spend our life regardless.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442879/#Comment_442879" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-14T20:21:53+00:00" title="February 14, 2015  8:21PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that's why another approach is to just look at what price similarly-scoped projects are going for, and use that as a starting-point.

More people will download and look at it, but when it comes time to choose what to play something you paid for is more likely to make it to the table. There's a (flawed) perception of quality associated with paying for something. <br/><br/>I'd argue that the very best approach is a combination - something you have to pay for, with lots of interesting supporting material people can look at and get excited about.

I mean, yes, the perception that it's worth more if you charge is there. Yes, something free will get snapped up by more people, and maybe a bigger number will play than if you charge.<br/><br/>But, there's another cost as well. To play a game, I need to read it, understand it well enough, and find enough other people wanting to play it. So, time is the dearer coin in some ways.<br/><br/>I've spent a fair bit of money on various books and am very backlogged. Some are full games, some campaign or scenario collections. But, let's say we have a day when I've decided I am reading something in my unread RPG pile. Okay, something unfamiliar is likely to take a backseat to all of the various Lovecraftian stuff I've not read (I actually run that), the various Fate stuff I've not read, the various *World stuff I've not read...<br/><br/>So, what I ask myself is "Why do I want to read this one next?" Once it's in my house, the answer isn't going to be "Because I spent so much on it." If that were the case, I'd have finished Horror on the Orient Express already. (I'm in book 3, with, I think, two more to go after.) But, it isn't "Because it's free." I have LOADS of free material on my hard drive.<br/><br/>And, that's where personal tastes come in.<br/><br/>Charge no less than you have to, that's for sure. What will get me to play it?<br/><br/>Is it in a category of Stuff I Want Right Now?<br/>Is it something getting good word of mouth?<br/>Is it something I can get?<br/>Is it affordable?<br/>Is it tangible or digital only? Does Bits&amp;Mortar apply?<br/>How hard is it for me to pick up?<br/>If it's harder than Call of Cthulhu, is there something that will make me want to learn the system anyway? Apparently, runes will -- much as I swear I don't like heavy crunch, if anyone's running Fate of the Norns, I want to play.<br/>Who will play it with me?<br/><br/>Cost? Not the least important, no. But, not the most. If your goal is that I'll play it, don't undercharge. A fair price won't hurt your chances that I'll play it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442896/#Comment_442896" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-15T09:45:20+00:00" title="February 15, 2015  9:45AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Getting someone to play is somewhat separate from pricing.

The price is just a tiny piece of several components. If you really want people to play it, play it with them and leave them wanting more.<br/><br/>One thing I'm toying around with is to have people pay for a cheaper beta, and make it sure that they opinions will affect the game. Research has shown that 4-5% of the target audience will buy into what you believe in. They will be your faithful followers, and drag the rest of the 25% that slightly interested in your product.<br/><br/>Focus on them. Make sure <i>they </i>know about your game. Market yourself.<br/><br/>However, o know your target audience is much harder than it sounds.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442898/#Comment_442898" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-15T14:36:17+00:00" title="February 15, 2015  2:36PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I think some great points have been brought up here, but to add some more details.<br/><br/>Free/PWYW will get it into people's hands, but you have to ask the question: is this something that takes the experience of reading it and makes it something you want to play. If you are a wizard with layout and/or with engaging text, this helps a lot. But you have to consider that a lot of the people who will download PWYW tiles have a folder on their hard drive with dozens (hundreds) of things. I think Jason's right that if you manage to get someone to pull the trigger on paying money, it creates a much tighter bond to actually running it.<br/><br/>Building buzz early never hurts, but there are tools for building buzz that you should not expect to work repeatedly. People are not going to be excited for "oh, here's a second set of beta rules!". You also have to worry about that even if you succeed in building buzz with early revisions, that certain people will get attached to those early revisions.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442904/#Comment_442904" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-15T18:16:59+00:00" title="February 15, 2015  6:16PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Giving it away for free through one avenue while you're also selling it through another is one way.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
