                    This came up at brunch with some friends. But how would you go about designing a MMORPG version of, lets say, Dogs in the Vineyards? <br/><br/>Can such a thing exist? The first, but not to my mind the worst, hurdle to overcome might be how conflicts are managed in a MMORPG sense. I admit though, I find the idea of a town of computer-run NPCs which spontaneously progreses with hierarchies of sin is very intriguing. <br/><br/>The key thing I'm looking for is to keep the essential element of these games, which, I strongly expect, necessitates a different culture than present MMORPG possess. As a purely theoretical question, what does it say about a game when you extrapolate its culture in this manner? That alone fascinates me about this question. <br/><br/>But alas, I actually have work to do...<br/><br/>   - Mendel S.                </div>

                            The interesting bit, for me, is that most computer RPGs rely on statistics: hit points, weapon damage, etc, etc. <br/><br/>Now, you could use worded traits instead: "I shoot like my father taught me", "I've got the eyes of a hawk". But then who would judge whether they're applicable in a conflict? Perhaps you could have some sort of peer review process: you can use "I shoot like my father taught me" except if your opponent objects, at which point other random players are called in to judge. Anyway, it's interesting.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            I think the OP might want to clarify how he's using the term "Indie". The example of Dogs suggests that we're talking about MMORPGs of weird, alternative, non-mainstream RPGs -- i.e. mechanically indie -- not just non-mainstream/DIY/low-budget MMORPGs. There are plenty of the latter but I don't know how many of them diverge from the standard hit-points-etc. model.<br/><br/>Personally I don't see the point of a DitV MMORPG -- there are no advantages I can tell to it being massively multiplayer. The synergy just isn't there, in the same way there is in a game with (say) an economy or a more complicated high-level resource game. An Ars Magica MMORPG, on the other hand, seems like it could be pretty awesome, since there's a cool system for developing and exploiting resources.                        </div>

                            I've been thinking about this topic a lot too. The trick is to make a game that leverages the advantages of the Web. I have an alpha of an admittedly flawed attempt to make an online Story Game <a href="http://planet-thirteen.com/forgotten/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a>. <br/><br/>The big challenge, IMHO, is finding a way to let the computer facilitate that part of the game that computers aren't good at. Computers are great for counting hit points and rendering images a la World of Warcraft. They're not very good at figuring out how to make good story.                        </div>

                            I'm too attached to the physicality and cues of the tabletop experience, and too experienced with the grind of current MMPOGs, to think much of the idea of "Story Games Online"...<br/><br/>...however, something like Jessica Hammer's little Babylon idea? That has the beginnings of awesome...<br/><br/><br/>(Edit: But yeah, interacting with a virtual world should mean more than playing whack-a-mole with ghosts!

Someone starts a thread with a full scenario laid out according to Town creation rules. In effect we're skipping to the point where the whole Town has already been actively revealed.<br/>

Each player lays down their judgement in an answer to the thread.<br/>

The players may then argue with each other as to whose judgement is the will of the King of Life.<br/>

                            I've been brainstorming how an MMORPG version of TSOY might work. Could computer-run NPCs and villains be scripted to play to players' Keys to create a dynamic story? Most MMORPG quests are of the "Fetch me a MacGuffin" or "Kill the Boss Monster" type. TSOY Keys might be useful for creating much more personalized quests, even quests that have multiple outcomes (if a player chooses to buy-off a Key).                        </div>

                            Hmm... some insight might be gained by looking at how modern <a href="http://wurb.com/if/award/1" rel="nofollow">Interactive Fiction</a> authors do their thing. I'm especially thinking of Emily Short's IF here, such as <a href="http://wurb.com/if/game/1326" rel="nofollow">Galatea</a>. IF is almost completely focused on exploration, rather than game or story creation, but they are working under roughly similar constraints...                        </div>

                            I'm not sure about how to make an MMOG out of an existing indie game.  However, I have a few thoughts about how to make MMOGs a little more like indie games.   First, I would try to describe characters within the game by some standard other than their ability to kill things.  Sure, you can tell stories about people that kill things, but I think the traditional tactical rpg approach has become a heavily reinforced box that MMOG designers have trouble thinking outside of.  Second, I would change the way characters interact with their environment.  Replace repetitive, unmeaningful interactions with the environment with player interaction and meaningful outcomes within the game world that result from player choices.  <br>
<br>
For instance, players could play craftpersons organized in villages.  They must trade resources and share information with each other to improve their ability in their chosen professions. Peridocally, villages are faced with some problem generated by the game engine (perhaps as a logical result of other events in game), and the players of a village must cooperate to overcome their problem.  To keep things massively multiplayer, villagers could travel between villages to share ideas or compete with professionals from other villages, or the villages themselves could compete as entities either economically or for prestige in regards to different professions.                        </br></br></div>

                            Mike,<br><br>Right on! My take on it is that the key to making a next generation MMPOG is to place two things at the heart of the game: a fully realized, functional game-world economy (with inputs and outputs), and a replacement for boring repetitive tasks (eg. engaging, dynamic mini-games for every interaction with the virtual environment, not just combat)...                        </br></br></div>

                            Stefan, based on what I've seen from people who try to make a fully-realized economy...  it's very, very hard to get right.  They all require outside intervention to keep from becoming dangerously (as in not-fun-anymore) unbalanced.  Even the economy in Second Life, which is one of the simplest there is when it comes right down to it, requires intervention from the Lindens from time to time to keep from running haywire.                        </div>

                            Fred, yep - for sure. <br><br>One of the central concerns is that it is all, well, virtual (except for the time input of the players/moderators/gms)! Even if we accept (a la Cory Doctorow) that there is no effective difference between a virtual economy in the real world and a virtual economy in the virtual world, players still will tend to see it differently - hence the "it's only a game" mantra. And then, that is further complicated by the interactions between the real and virtual economies, and even virtual to virtual (although, i doubt that this latter is really significant (provided we're not talking about stealing customers).<br><br>But, dropping those meta-game concerns, you can still start with a base level of good game design: ie. What does it take to make the game world cycle dynamic and self-consistant?<br/><br/>I have a hunch that it might just be finding a replacement for <i>character advancement</i>, in all its forms. (A hurculean task, no doubt...)                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Sorry, I've been excessively busy for a while. I was looking at this thread to be a jumping point for general ideas, so I didn't think it needed significant guidance, but there are a few ideas on this that I've been mucking with since my original post. <br/><br/>First, just to clarify, I meant essentially "story-game" MMORPGs. But that brings up some different ways of viewing economies. I started with Dogs in the Vineyards, and took the idea of self-evolving towns with (flexible, albeit not totoally free) room for varying conflicts. Added on to this a use-evolving correlation of traits and relationships that determined whether they apply to the present conflict state - as a set of traits and relationships you have selected. I can just envision a handful of players getting together and playing through an automated town, and it being enjoyable. <br/><br/>But where is the long term goal, the economy to manage the growth and changes? I don't think it ought to be a character economy, like in traditional MMORPGs, or a stuff economy. But what about a story economy? What if the story of your dog is the residual, available for all when your dog dies or retires, linking with other dog's stories, on-going or not. And what if the social prestige in those stories is the driving force of the economy. It's not a question of can you get the most powerful dog, but can you get the most powerful story of a dog's career - by some user inputs and much play of the game.<br/><br/>From the rise of machinima and on the other side, fanfiction communities, this sort of thing ought to be viable. It may still be somewhat infeasible, but I think it merits some thought if only that. And it is interesting to see where a small scale game can scale if you free it from the typical requirements of MMORPGs. Perhaps that is a valid analytical question for RPGs in general - what is the core economy of this game if you had to extend it to 2,000 players?<br/><br/>I hope that helps,<br/><br/>   - Mendel S.                        </div>

                            I wonder if there might be a viable path where you break out the roles of "game master" and "player" across the user base to cover all the peices of a story game that a computer program can't do well.<br/><br/>For example: the server sets up a proto town with a number of characters, relationships, and lines of tension. Then a gamemaster refines the conflict situation and sets up the town for players. This is the "gamemaster" mode of play.<br/><br/>Then some users in the "player" mode play the town as a story game. Moderation of conflicts is done by the players themselves within the limits of the situation. This is essential some form of computer-assisted story gaming.<br/><br/>So to boil it down, the computer creates a proto situation. A player in gamemaster mode refines the situation and sets up specific conflicts for the players. Then the players play through the situation.                        </div>

                            If the computer is playing the role of the In A Wicked Age's oracle, it would probably be trivial to extend that situation generation ability by hooking up some sort of search routine linking the potential conflict seeds with keywords (or simple logical statements) provided by the player's character sheets. <br/>Then you wouldn't need a gamemaster to prime the situation. (If you do have a gamemaster, you might as well make the computer's job be soley to play 'expert program' - assisting situation creation &amp; doing random name/colour generation, etc.)<br/><br/>With or without a gamemaster, the tricky part is then making the conflict resolution "intelligently" playable by the computer. You need a way for the players to enter information concisely &amp; logically for the computer to interpret and engage a strategy with - perhaps best suited would be a complex form of poker, where information entry comes in the form of card-combinations and strategy (when to give, how much to bid) can be judged by counting cards.<br/><br/>And then you still need an economy rewarding the players (and, seperately, game-masters). <br/><br/>Story-driven economy is an interesting notion, to be sure! It does seem to drive the online Sims community, in part (although their MMPOG failed)...<br/>Would a "highlight reel" of your character's play engagement be such a reward? ...And are these sort of rewards the same as the economy?                        </div>

                            I think the most direct way to get a real MMOSG is to start with PBP, that is, play-by-post games run in forum software. You start there, then you refactor the information architecture until it stops resembling traditional forum software's structure and focuses on the needs of the game. How to do that is the big question, of course.                        </div>

                            I think the significant bottleneck here is in infrastructure. Coming up with the most sophisticated, leave-graphical-MUDs-in-your-dust game design doesn't really matter until you have the means to deliver that experience. Take a look at those <a href="http://www.garagegames.com/blogs/4280/10708" rel="nofollow">network diagrams</a> for Minions of Mirth. If you don't recognize it, those represent a pretty significant investment in time and capital for one person.<br/><br/>Now, what are the odds that a person with the resources and wherewithal to get all the technical shit together is going to be the same person who has also developed talents for designing these new-fangled story game things we're so big on? As shown by Minions of Mirth, a person with the former capabilities can pull it off if he's working with a pretty traditional, widely-understood mode of gaming. But it seems to me that to accomplish something more, you're going to have to get people to work together without retaining any exclusive ownership of what they're creating, and now you're looking down the barrel of corporatization and all that entails.<br/><br/>I mean, it all sounds cool and all, but I think it's all very "blue sky" until someone has addressed these less glamorous tasks. For this reason, I think the publishing model developed at the Forge, where a single creative individual can deliver his or her innovations without fronting a large amount of start-up capital, will be where the real game design innovation will continue to occur for some time to come.<br/><br/>There's also the matter of how these hippie tabletop story games rely very heavily on modes of natural human communication which have been in development for thousands of years, whereas in creating a virtual social experience someone actually has to realize and implement avenues of communication, many of which are widely taken for granted. But that's yet another can of worms.                        </div>

                            Having a friend works fine... if you can get them to show up at the same time as a couple other folks. This is a legit problem for many people.<br/><br/>My point was just that the complexity one has to deal with oneself in order to build online games and gaming tools is steadily decreasing. Combine this with the growing number of people who realize that good games don't have to look like the complex games we already know, and can in fact learn from the massive community of people using forums, LJ and blogs to do something they call "RPGs," and the picture gets a lot less doomy.                        </div>

I'm going to go out on a limb here, and I hope this is taken the way that it's meant: an offering of opinion to hopefuly help us understand the parameters of the challenge. I strongly suspect that getting a computer to intelligently handle conflict resolution isn't going to be possible.

The following "game" is not really solving conflict resolution, but it's playing in that area:
<blockquote>The Restaurant Game is a research project at the MIT Media Lab that will algorithmically combine the gameplay experiences of thousands of players to create a new game. In a few months, we will apply machine learning algorithms to data collected through the multiplayer Restaurant Game, and produce a new single-player game that we will enter into the 2008 Independent Games Festival.<br/><br/><a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~jorkin/restaurant/" rel="nofollow">http://web.media.mit.edu/~jorkin/restaurant/</a><br/></blockquote> </div>

                            Another approach, touched on above, might be to have human gamemasters that design/control/GM their own quests or areas in the game world. The game's economy is not based on character advancement, but on players supporting good gamemasters (based on voting, usage, whatever). Some games (like Neverwinter Nights) had content-building/sharing tools which allowed the designer/GM to play the monsters.<br/><br/><a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/dms/dmclientintro.html" rel="nofollow">Introduction to the Dungeon Master Client for NWN</a> </div>

                            Tony, I actually disagree with that assessment. The only real limitation on "what a computer can do" is that human beings must be able to break it down into an algorithm. Computer programs have already been developed that can play chess or <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/SHR/4-2/text/cohen.html" rel="nofollow">create original modern art</a>. Of course, somebody's going to have to break down the hundreds or maybe thousands of tiny decisions and interactions made by human beings during normal moderation of conflict resolution. Oh, as a matter of practicality? Yeah, better, I think, (and probably more fun) to just incorporate human judges into this process.<br/><br/>I think using an existing game as some sort of data-aggregation tool for this endeavor is an intriguing possibility. I don't know if Blizzard <i>&amp;c.</i> are sufficiently forward-thinking to do this, but I bet it would be possible to set up tools to monitor unexpected emergent behaviors in how players of these games are <i>really</i> using the software, in the ways their creators never anticipated. (Cool link about The Restaurant Game, Chris!)<br/><br/>NWN is a good example of a set of tools that permits end-users to devise their own solutions to infrastructure/organization matters. But it's not really <i>massively multi-player</i>. I don't know if that criteria is essential to our present discussion. I think there's also a lot of "my GM Herbie"s in that particular community, too -- people constructing their own fun game experiences <i>in spite of</i> the baggage of the provided rules.                        </div>

                            Making something like NWN into a MMORPG would be a relatively trivial thing. But I agree that this is not fixing the problem. In point of fact, I play a weekly game of Hero Quest by chat, and, thus, Mr. Sugarbaker's proposed advantage for online play is already in place, without a MMORPG. For a MMORPG to really be advantageous over what we have in chat play now, or MUDs, etc, etc, are for the computer to act as GM, and/or for there to be some advantage to the massively multiplayer angle.<br/>
<br/>
I see absolutely no advantage to the massively multiplayer part of things for story games. How is playing DitV with thousands of people going to improve the play? Thousands of dogs running around? That doesn't even seem to be canonical to the game. Sure you can have multiple servers, and limit the number of dogs on each, but then you're starting to reduce the supposed advantage of massively multiplayer. Until you get to the point where you might as well just be playing by chat in terms of the number of players involved. Thats' all that's neccessary, provably, to make a good story.<br/>
<br/>
So massive is not an advantage, and automated GMing seems impractical. Or, rather, before a "Story Game MMORPG" becomes feasible, somebody is going to have to come up with a sort of game where the massive multiplayer feature actually is a plus, and where they have a model that can be run by the computer.<br/>
<br/>
And an in-game economy is not it. Oh, that'll make play less about power, sure. But it's a false dichotomy to say that all play that is not power play is about story. The "realistic economy" model will just get you Second Life, or the failed Sims game. Been there, done that, and it won't provide support for players creating thematic output. Neither does interactive fiction ala skotos. Just allowing people to create story doesn't promote story. You tend, in those games, to get massive incoherency. This is the PK vs "Storytellers" dilemma.<br/>
<br/>
To get a functionally "story game" MMORPG, you do have to have something like Mendel is proposing, where the system does reward you for making thematic decisions. And, no, no, no, this can't be to empower or enrich characters. Even if the rewarded behavior is story oriented, if the reward form is empowerment, some (most) players will default to power play. Leading to abominations of theme, as people try to justify decisons based on the output power level that it provides.<br/>
<br/>
Nope, both sides of the reward equation, what you get rewarded for and what you can use the reward for, have to be about making theme to accomplish the goal of the thread. How you do that in a medium that essentially reduces actual player social interaction (not character interaction, that's not the same - player interaction)? That's the challenge.<br/>
<br/>
Not impossible, I don't think, but very difficult to say the least.<br/>

Existing MMORPGs have this same conceptual problem. Can every character be one of millions of "big heroes" they pretend to be? And most players play with a small-ish group of friends or guild members. The "massive" part of the game is mostly the social networking for finding a party and chat.<br><br>So how would a Hero Quest MMORPG differ from Hero Quest play-by-chat? It could be the same "find friends" social networking as existing MMORPGs.                        </br></br></div>

                            This seems to be segue-ing into the same territory as the "Play-By-Post with an active Audience" thread, perhaps necessarily so.<br><br>However, still keeping Simulation to the side, what if we re-defined the terms of the game? <br><br>Not the story of these characters, doing these things, but the living story of the world, as an agregate.

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Larry</cite>only real limitation on "what a computer can do" is that human beings must be able to break it down into an algorithm. </blockquote>
I've been thinking about my answer to this, and I realize that you may be right. As long as the range of possible conflicts and narration is limited to a specific set of circumstances, a computer could probably do some form of conflict resolution. I was mistaking "what I think of as conflict resolution" for conflict resolutin in general. <br><br>Nevertheless, I think there are pretty serious limitations to what a computer can successfuly narrate. As far as I'm concerned, the challenge in bringing indie insights to online gaming doesn't lie in making computers better narrators (though that would help), it's in finding a way to harnass a massive number of possible narrators to make better gameplay.<br/><br/>So in summary, yeah, I guess you're right.                        </br></br></div>

                            It occurs to me one "trick" you could do for an automated conflict resolution system would be to focus on explicit stakes*, created by and agreed upon by players before resolution. I can see this becoming almost a sort of bartering or bidding design in its own right. Say... each player authors a little statement about what happens in the game world if he wins, maybe ticks off some boxes for consequences that impact system or something. When both players can agree that the stakes seem fair, they play the little resolution game to determine which outcome occurs. The computer doesn't have to create any narration, it simply implements a human-specified outcome.<br/><br/>Well... maybe. I think that would require a certain minimum level of trust and give-and-take. I don't know if you can rely on that on the "massively" scale.<br/><br/><br/>*Disclaimer: Anyone reading who's not yet clear on "stakes", please do not take away from this the common misconception that stakes in tabletop conflict resolution systems must be explicit and pre-defined.                        </div>
