I want to make sure that the players are free to choose NOT to fight without choosing to suck.<br/><br/>So I have two questions:<br/><br/>How can I maintain the plausibility of nonviolent options open to the players?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323046/#Comment_323046" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-04T08:21:36+00:00" title="May  4, 2011  8:21AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Find a copy of Misspent Youth, even if it's the free "eyebleed" pdf on the site.  Step through conflict, but don't use violence in your raises.<br/><br/>It doesn't change a thing!  It's still awesome.  We've even used the conflict mechanics there to stretch over three days worth of effort.  One of the Youthful Offenders used their smarts to infiltrate the securit detail and get the badges they needed to get past a checkpoint, which took six hours of painfully clever effort.<br/><br/>The Authority responds by taking that blow, nobody knows how, but the gate's been compromised, and their operation is threatened.  So they up the plant's production and move all their hostages/workers closer to the chemicals.<br/><br/>... Long story short, the framework and the rythm provided plenty of tension, especially when the players stood up to do something.  That entire conflict, and many others, have passed without physical violence.<br/><br/>It may not be what you're looking for exactly, but it might give you some ideas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu" title="kobutsu"><img alt="kobutsu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c22b7a0141698356c899c4f7f1200ed7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu">kobutsu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323048/#Comment_323048" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-04T08:28:18+00:00" title="May  4, 2011  8:28AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Escalation needn't be about methods\u2014it can be about stakes.

If you've met the kooky old keeper of the lighthouse, you might be able care more about the light being sabotaged, before you even deal with the crazy monster killing folks. <br/><br/>When you have issues and problems on the line that can be solved without violence, then you can have tension that is cranked up by the threat of violence.<br/><br/>Secondly, it makes me think of advice in Dogs in the Vineyard, for the gm to ask for smaller things in raises rather than large. The opening scene with the Nazis in the French farm house in Inglorious Basterds illustrates this. Christopher Waltz asking the farmer for something innocuous like a glass of milk hugely increased the tension, long before any violence broke out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323052/#Comment_323052" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-04T08:54:33+00:00" title="May  4, 2011  8:54AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Got pulled away by work.)<br/><br/>Right now, I'm anticipating that the prep for this game will involve me quietly drawing an Oracle and doing IAWA-style Best Interests, then adding the Doctor and Companions.<br/><br/>So Question 2 is:<br/><br/>What are the tricks for preparing scenarios with plausibly nonviolent solutions?<br/><br/>I'm especially looking for quick tricks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323054/#Comment_323054" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-04T08:58:26+00:00" title="May  4, 2011  8:58AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Emily, that's a great idea.
