She used the guns and ammo taken from their fallen enemies to pay off the doctor.<br/><br/>===<br/>Ready: "Young girl, where are your parents? Aren't they worried about you?"<br/>Shadow: "I'm an orphan. I worry about myself.<br/>R: "How about a guardian? Friends? Isn't there anyone to look after you?"<br/>S - Looking meaningfully at the pile of guns "I can look after myself", moved to get up<br/>R: "Wait, wait young one. You need to be careful of those injuries. You should rest here the night"<br/><br/>Now, Shadow wants to know why the doc wants to keep her there and rolls "read a person"<br/>Is he telling the truth - yes, the injuries were bad, she needs rest<br/>(frustration)<br/>Shadow then opens her mind to the Psychic Maelstrom - she gets an impression of voices "Hungry.... Blooooood"<br/>(still frustration - I haven't told her why the doctor is acting that way)<br/>===<br/><br/>Another scene, Amiette our Brainer has seduced Brewer (a overweight dandy who surrounds himself with beauty, and is the local source of fresh meat,  vegetables, and fruits)<br/><br/>She sneaks into his room and arrays herself seductively on the bed, when Brewer lumbers into the room the rolls to seduce him (10), and wants him to sleep with her. Brewer takes one look at her and immediately starts divesting himself and lowers himself onto the bed.<br/><br/>The player then says that she wants to find out what he's really up to, She does her sex move and deep brain scans him - (frustration) cant find a question that she really wants answered. She goes with <br/>"What are your secret pains". - Brewer surrounds himself with beauty and polite manners as he is deathly afraid of violence and mess, afraid of how he will react to it".<br/>===<br/><br/>Now, in both cases my players wanted information X, but there was no way to ask a question that would get X. And in both cases I was trying to stick to the rules as written and only answer questions that appear in the booklets.<br/><br/>Now - I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">think</span> I understand why this is - but i really need to get it better explained.<br/><br/>I also think that I'm doing it wrong by just answering the questions directly like I am.

There's "What is your character really feeling?" and "What does your character intend to do?" questions that would answer her...If you fail the roll, well, you just don't know.\n<blockquote>The player then says that she wants to find out what he's really up to, She does her sex move and deep brain scans him - (frustration) cant find a question that she really wants answered.</blockquote>\nSame here, the "What is your character really feeling?" and "What does your character intend to do?" and even the "What does your character wish I'd do?" fit the bill here perfectly, if you were reading a person. Deep Brain Scan gives you emotional leverage over the character.\n<blockquote>I also think that I'm doing it wrong by just answering the questions directly like I am. Am I doing it wrong?</blockquote> No, answer them straightforward and remember you're bound by them. Your answer cannot be a lie. If you don't know, make it up and stick with it. Still, I fail to see how the list of questions is not satisfactory...\n<blockquote>(as an aside - can "going aggro" work on a whole gang?)</blockquote>\nI'd say no, because the "suck it up" aspect of going aggro is immediately dependent on the fictional situation. If I'm aiming a gun at a guy, I can't be aiming at the whole gang. But if you target their leader or big guy, that might be enough to make them all back up, yes. Or make your target order them to back off, if the rest of them actually cares if he lives or dies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275082/#Comment_275082" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T01:56:00+00:00" title="June  9, 2010  1:56AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i think the big source of the frustration was :They found out that the food they were being served - specifically the meat - belonged to humans.

Sure he's showing a fatherly concern, but when she reads him is he feeling guilt because he knows she'll be murdered, or maybe he feels greed at the thought of supple fresh human meat. <br/><br/>Or the <i>what do you intend to do</i> question: he intends to keep her there until the thugs arrive and take her to the slaughter. Or maybe he intends to put her under, suffocate with a pillow and cut open.

I feel like the MC was trying to hide something the PC clearly wanted to know but was coming up with equivocation. <br/><br/>"Now, in both cases my players wanted information X, but there was no way to ask a question that would get X. And in both cases I was trying to stick to the rules as written and only answer questions that appear in the booklets."<br/><br/>No man, you gotta stick to the fucking PRINCIPLES and the MC MOVES! Why didn't you announce off-screen or future badness? Moreover, you have total license to tell the PCs whatever you want, so you could just said so.<br/><br/>Also, the Deep-Brain Scan <i>isn't</i> mind-reading, per se. Like, don't use it when you want to find out X. For that, some combination of read a person and going aggro and most importantly <b>in character conversation</b> is needed.<br/><br/>Like so:<br/><br/>SHADOW: Yo Doc, I think I've made it pretty clear that'll be fine. Why the fuck do you want me to stay? <br/>DOC: Because I honestly think you might need to rest; you could have a concision. (Doc doesn't give a shit about her injuries if he wants to kill and eat her, right?).<br/>SHADOW [spend one of her holds on "is he telling the truth?"]<br/>MC: He definitely has reasons other than those for wanting you to stay. <br/>SHADOW [GOES AGGRO]: (Puts knife to Doc's throat.) Listen you creepy little shit, I'm not that fucking dumb. If you don't tell me <i>exactly</i> and in fucking <i>detail</i> why the fuck you want me to stay right the fuck now ima paint the fucking walls with your blood and fucking entrails! Do you get me motherfucker?<br/><br/>In my understanding of AW, the players really need to take control. The MCs jobs is to make them lose control. Oh, and stick to the principles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275088/#Comment_275088" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T02:48:09+00:00" title="June  9, 2010  2:48AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What other people have said! Reading a person isn't mind reading, but if you actually ask, IC, the question you want answered, "Are they telling the truth?" will usually suffice.<br/><br/>One bit of advice I remember Vincent giving in the development blog ran along the lines of, "They can ask any question, but you only have to answer one of the ones on the list" which can be a helpful way of framing it. So if Shadow asked "Why is he so eager to have me stay?" you might interpret that as "what does he intend to do?" and say "Yeah, he's licking his lips when he thinks you aren't watching, and his stomach growls a bit. You're pretty sure he's gonna chop you up as soon as you're under and eat your young, supple flesh." Stuff like that. (Don't forget, disturbing revelations at every opportunity.)<br/><br/>And also as others have said... if somebody's looking for information, there's plenty of your moves that you can use to just hand it to them. Announce future badness, Tell them the possible consequences and ask, etc. Giving the PCs the right knowledge is a great way to keep their lives not boring.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275095/#Comment_275095" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T03:46:55+00:00" title="June  9, 2010  3:46AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2010 3:48AM by DWeird.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I dunno about what problem the player had in the first instance - there's definitelly a question you can ask that would have told her what she needed to know.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Deep Brain scan... I've noticed more than once that the questions you have to ask sometimes a bit too limiting. As I see it, Deep Brain Scan *IS* mindreading (or shoveling through the subconscious, at least), so I'd just houserule it to allow to spend hold you get from it on regular read-a-person rolls.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, um. I wasn't there, but the thing that I notice immediatelly is how fluffy-nice the two characters you mentioned are. Did you pitch the game as desperate and blood-curdling and then fill it with care bears? If so, the "frustration" might just be confusion 'bout that mismatch.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr, if this fluffyness is not shared by other characters (you did mention aggro'ing a gang...), maybe your players are just suspicious at how the doctor and the brewer don't have obvious intentions of manslaughter? "What's he planning!? SOMETHING HORRIBLE, I bet!" is what they're thinking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275101/#Comment_275101" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T05:15:21+00:00" title="June  9, 2010  5:15AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You don't need to house-rule it, Brainers' already get <i>Casual brain receptivity</i> as a psychic read a person move.

One of them (Man, gunlugger) killed off the old hardholder and his cronies. They came back as a group to repair their jeep. The new gang of thugs was trying to take over and was running around trying to intimidate them. Brewer is the one providing fruit and veg and meat - high end stuff. He's basically Hannibal lecter + 200kg. The players wanted the nice food and comfy sheets, brewer said "fine, remove those uncultured louts and bring me their bodies".<br/><br/>They did.<br/><br/>They were then served "Uncultured Louts ala carte", (which they realised) Frankie (driver) and Shadow went out to sleep in the Jeep/Truck. Man took up the offer of a bed and wash, and also took advantage of the girls in the house and was not seen by anyone for the whole night. This was when Amiette tried to get into brewer's head.<br/><br/>During the night - the fact that all the guards were killed bit them as the mutant dog-things assaulted the town. Frankie and Shadow tried to kill them as they came over the wall, and Frankie eventually got frustrated at them and went to ram the little buggers - smashing a hole in the wall - right into a huge swarm of the beasts. Then spnt some time with shadow frantically trying to shoot them off the truck with the mounted machinegun (my other car is a tank), and Amiette was holed up in the house being attacked.<br/><br/>Shadow tried to shoot some of the beasts attacking the house - ended up killing the defenders and blowing in the window - amiette then ran upstairs to the attic being chased by a couple.<br/><br/>There was at the end of the session a dramatic rescue by frankie and shadow, with amiette falling out of the attic window and the three of them noticing the beasts trying to open the locked cellar doors - growling for blood and meat.<br/><br/>(Man is currently in the meat locker having been drugged and was soon to be prepared for the next few meals)                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275138/#Comment_275138" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T09:09:43+00:00" title="June  9, 2010  9:09AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So yes: your players will need to be more aggressive if they want to force the truth out of people.

You're not supposed to stick strickly to the wording of the question or try to hold secrets back from them.  Your really just lay it all out there.<br/><br/>Like, if she read the doc and asked "Is he telling the truth?"  As MC I would have said, "No, actually, he really wants to eat you," but described the scene more, like Ben did above, and make it clear how she gets that sense by looking at him.  You really can't do the 'mysterious GM' thing and have secrets gradually emerge through play.  They made the roll, so you have to fucking tell them what's going on.  This doesn't mean they can ask any question -- that's an expanded move -- but the standard questions are still really, really good in most cases.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275154/#Comment_275154" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T09:50:49+00:00" title="June  9, 2010  9:50AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2010 9:52AM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

As MC I would have said, "No, actually, he really wants to eat you,"</blockquote>\nSounds like you're giving the player two questions for the price of one. (As has already been pointed out, 'what does your character intend to do?' is one of the questions.) Not that there's anything wrong with being a generous, kind-hearted MC! *cough*\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dionysus</cite>Is he telling the truth - yes, the injuries were bad, she needs rest</blockquote>\nIt may just be a language/phrasing issue but you almost make it sound like you were giving an objective evaluation of the truth of the statement -- instead of giving an answer about whether the person themselves was being honest. To me this question is about honesty -- are they being deceptive, or are they being honest -- not about whether what they're saying is actually true or not. <br/><br/>And of course 'partially' is a different answer than 'yes' -- so in this case, if the Doctor is both honestly concerned about the injuries AND also scheming agains the character you can just say 'he's being honest about that, but there's more going on.' At which point the player has something to follow up on, if they are really serious about getting to the bottom of things.<br/><br/>But I don't feel that AW is, for example, like Dogs in the Vineyard, where the GM has to go out of their way to provide additional information or answers to questions the players didn't or were not able to ask. While you're not supposed to hold back secrets, you aren't supposed to volunteer them either. You can certainly volunteer that they exist, in general, but if the players want to know they have to go after it, and that means making rolls, and that means more opportunities for things to go horribly wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275168/#Comment_275168" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T11:21:30+00:00" title="June  9, 2010 11:21AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're probably right, Daniel.

As MC, you're looking for opportunities to reveal the world. You want to paint the picture of your fucked up little apocalypse every chance you get. If the guy wants to eat them, and they read him and ask questions, I am <i>definitely</i> going to say that he wants to eat them even if they don't think to ask about that specifically. That's part of "putting your bloody fingerprints" all over the game.<br/><br/>"I wonder if this is the guy working with Dremmer. I say, 'At least that fuck Dremmer isn't here.' What's he really feeling?"<br/>"He wants to kill you and eat you. He's not really paying attention to what you're saying. He can't wait to taste your flesh."<br/>"Jesus, fuck, this guy's a cannibal? Shit!"<br/><br/>Don't be all nit-picky and tight-lipped. 'Two questions for the price of one' is not a problem, ever. Say more than you think you should. Digress occasionally on some interesting thing. Be expansive. Answer more than they asked. Cover everything in apocalyptica every chance you get.
