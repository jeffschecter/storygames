adopted the three now-orphaned children of one of them.

[Mythender]<br/><br/><b>The teenage daughter</b> of a single mom, who together with her mother and others was locked into an abandoned military installation whose AI attacked and killed most of them, and who died trying (in vain) to keep a paranoid survivor from launching the site's nuclear weapons. [Geiger Counter]<br/><br/><b>An Eladrin warlock</b> who shifted and teleported amongst enemy kobolds, cursing them and inflicting Witchfire and worse fates, and who with her brave compatriots defeated an admittedly small white dragon deep underneath the ruins of an old temple.

I'm looking at you JoePub.  <br/><br/>I played in the most INTENSE game of <b>DRYH </b>ever with Carl* as GM, Wilson and Daniel.  Oh my Gods, I cried.  I think the other two players at least teared up as the father of the missing children narrated the magic horse sacrificing itself to save the Princess and therefore win his children back.  I actually burst into tears while describing it to Ogre during the drive home. <br/><br/>I had a wonderful time!!

I had a fantastic time; my only regret was that I signed up for a lot of slots ahead of time, so I missed cool stuff like Principia, Anima Prime and Roach...  but only because I was doing other cool stuff.  Why must bilocation continue to elude me?<br/><br/>I drove up from Portland in time to playtest Shadowrun Agon in slot 2, as run by Philip LaRose:  I think the conversion worked really well, but search time was high, mostly because I and a couple other players had no Agon experience.  I got dinner at Kai's with Tony D, Ogre Whiteside, Micky Schulz and someone else whose name I have misplaced, then played in the same Mythender playtest as Christian.<br/><br/>I have to take a moment aside here to mention how world-shatteringly awesome that game was.  It felt like the perfect convergence of system, players, atmosphere and intent for that particular night in that particular world.  I played a psychotic six-year-old saint from the Children's Crusade, wielding the hammer that drove the nails into the True Cross and just generally floating around trying to single-handedly bring about the Second Coming.  Along with Christian, we had Jackson Tegu playing a guy with a fairy-prison sword who literally killed mountains, and Joe McDonald as a violinist who was trying to redeem himself of debauchery after winning a musical duel with Metatron.  And of course there was Ryan Macklin, running the game and opposing us with two monsters:  a thousand-foot-long salamander wyrm, and The Earth Itself.  Jackson beheaded the serpent, Joe was killed by lava and born anew <i>in the middle of the game,</i> and then the earth swallowed us and I detonated it with a nuke made of God.  I think I'm going to be chasing the fun level of that game for a long time.<br/><br/>The next day I played a drug dealer with political aspirations in Carl Rigney's Don't Rest Your Head game, along with Wilson Zorn's obsessive sampling musical genius and Jana Spear's wuxia fashioncore schoolgirl; I ended up selling all my compassion at a floating market in return for the bullet that would kill me, and then effectively selling us all into prison at Mother When's high school in exchange for protection from the Clockwork Ravens.  After lunch at Subway with several people (including Mac, a kid from the D&amp;D/WoW world who had just wandered into the con while staying upstairs), I managed to leap onto Brandon Amancio's last-minute D&amp;D 4e game with Doug Bartlet, John, Tony, Mac (the aforementioned tone-locking ranger), and Hans Andersen.  I played a Tiefling Warlord who was useful in the first kobold battle but played sacrificial lamb to John's Acid Arrow in the second.<br/><br/>After that was dinner with roughly 60% of those remaining at GPNW; I think we pushed every regular table in Kai's together, and Brandon was our spillover onto the high bar tables.  Finally, in the improvised sixth slot, I showed up late to Joe's game of Cheap and so was even more confused than the rest of the group.  Toward the end of the night things were getting more exciting as we started to piece the system together, but sadly, we weren't quick or bold enough to get Joe's pants that time.  I started the drive back to Portland at 9:30, with the windows down, singing and slapping my face to try and stay awake.  The risk of horrible death was more than worth it.<br/><br/>Jackson:  "Fall like a comet / to take out Bahamut."<br/>Christian:  "Was that...  freestyle Final Fantasy rap?"<br/><br/>John:  "These guys are 10-line BASIC programs with slings."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147377/#Comment_147377" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-02T15:26:19+00:00" title="June  2, 2008  3:26PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For fuck's sake, tell me about <i>Montsegur 1244</i> immediately.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ping" title="ping"><img alt="ping" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/41dd9b29bf2b05c9bd9b60bb5a720410?s=32&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D32&amp;r=G"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ping">ping</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147379/#Comment_147379" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-02T15:31:23+00:00" title="June  2, 2008  3:31PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had an absolute blast this weekend!

Sitting at a table with Nancy, Albert and Hans was a all-star crew, all of whom i trusted enough to pretty much lose my shit and care-about-everything-that-happened to 11. (follow?) Everything was just so good. The scenes on the roof with My and Nancy's Pilots drinking stolen scotch and fighting over (and due to) feelings for Albert's Pilot; the borderline abuse i was dishing to my anchor (also portrayed by Nancy) which she just <i>took</i> because her other choice would be to let me die- yeah, it was fucking good. Like, enough for me to run off for months, if need be. Luckily, there's no fucking way i'm not gonna play like this for a space of months.<br/><br/>Hans portrayed the first anchor of the session, as Albert's 14 year old Pilot was building her mech around herself, and the way Hans described the situation and surroundings was dizzying and so rapid as to startle me into feeling a shot of <i>fear</i>, though i had nothing <i>mechanically</i> at stake in the scene.  It was all awesome. It was <i>especially</i> awesome how Carl, on behalf of all of us, got up once to go to the next table and ask some punk in a yellow t-shirt named Ben Lehman who was playing <b>Sugar Fighter Black</b> to try and keep it down, we were trying to focus on our game's touching moments... a game that he wrote. <br/><br/>this is why i love our indie game community.

Cuz if you are, it'd be criminal if we went another full year before sitting at the same gaming table again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147448/#Comment_147448" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-02T21:28:10+00:00" title="June  2, 2008  9:28PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            what the fuck, you're living in seattle? <br/>i'm in olympia, like an hour and a half south of you. <br/>it is seriously on.<br/><br/>remind you to tell you about how i turned your <b>Calvin and Hobbes Snowball Fight RPG</b> into a lovely nightmare called <b>War Alice</b>.<br/>don't ask me soon, though; i have to go find my notes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zornwil" title="zornwil"><img alt="zornwil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zornwil">zornwil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147473/#Comment_147473" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-02T23:25:20+00:00" title="June  2, 2008 11:25PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2008 7:47PM by zornwil.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, there must be a gaming hangover, but it's well worth it!<br/>\n<br/>\nI just woke up after a nap, recovering from a heady lack of rest.  I know, I shouldn't have rested my head, but I awoke safe and sound, although now I'm back in this mundane world instead of the strange and wonderful dreamworld of this weekend.  Ah, but the memories, fuel to flourish even here!<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that was a bit off, but that's about the best I can do right now, after staying up talking with Carl until nearly 4 AM.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was an awesome convention to me, and in this post I use the "awesome" properly, not colloquially, i.e., I am in awe.  And being both still in the rosy hue of awe and still recovering from the collective creative burst of this weekend, I'm not really able to properly focus, but I do want to get down my thoughts, based on my notes from the games I ran and my memories of the games I played in.  This will be long, a big braindump, something I try to do on occassion, even if an email to myself, to record things before they become too vague in memory but also to post here in case it jogs anyone else's memories or otherwise give feedback.  You'll see very different foci in the write-ups on games below, having to do with how my head wraps around each game.  For example, the PTA write-up is very rich in specific narration details, and that's because I feel (and think) more like the audience than participant when I produce PTA, reacting to the players based on too-many wasted years of watching TV in my youth (these days I actually watch rather little TV on the whole), whereas the CNP write-up is distinctly meta about the way the game went and how at least I saw my role in it working.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst and foremost, thanks, thanks, thanks to the Go Play organizers.  It should be mentioned that on a logistical note this year was even better as the process of signing up and finding games had, at least for me, just the right combo of organization and flexibility.  Also, and more importantly, I REALLY liked the variation in time slots, for me at least these were just the right variation in hours for games, and I really appreciate that.  It definitely increased enjoyment because it allowed for games that needed more than 3 hours to exist, and I enjoy a mix of longer and shorter sessions.  I would like to see the same times and durations for slots next year.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not sure where to begin and won't give justice to the wonderful players this weekend.  Everyone was great to play with, and there were many exceptional shiny moments from so many of you; I suspect that everyone contributed at least one exceptional shiny moment this weekend, the kind of thing we remember forever (even if perhaps a bit foggily as we age!), which is a great accomplishment.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs John Harper pointed out, it was great to see Jackson's Knights and Squires in-development impromptu working draft play, and I thank Jackson for sharing that, I really like the idea of this game and where it's going.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and that was also about the best I'll do for people' s names, I'm terrible at remembering names, so as you won't see too many names below please note it's not for lack of impact.  In many cases below I do have first names down if I was with it enough to get them down in my notes while running games.<br/>\n<br/>\nGames in subsequent parts -<br/>\n<br/>\nPTA, Beth's Underground:

Oh my Gods, I cried. I think the other two players at least teared up as the father of the missing children narrated the magic horse sacrificing itself to save the Princess and therefore win his children back. I actually burst into tears while describing it to Ogre during the drive home.<br/>\n<br/>\n....<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, this was a truly awesome game, and thanks to all involved (Carl, Daniel, yourself), I did a partial write-up at http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6656&amp;page=1#Item_1 ,it's mentioned in my general stuff above but I wanted to respond to your note and call out this game, anyway.  I was definitely getting misty at the point you mentioned, and was a bit choked up over the whole thing towards the end, given how intense it was.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side note, I've never been big on traditional fairy tales even as I like the plots and such, and games focused on fairy tales haven't really grabbed me over the past years, but this one has really pushed my interest in modern versions of fairy tales and I'm toying with the idea of using DRYH to run something a bit more oriented towards that, not to force a story as we had of course (nor would I want to, I don't like to try to redo something that's already done so very well), but rather to support a style that's more specifically like "Tales of Faerie" with modern people interacting, Gaiman-esque style you might say.  I think the exhaustion and madness both work quite well, even if exhaustion isn't the exact term you'd apply to how an intense and failed effort leads to a sleeping beauty or an entranced follower or such, but can easily be used that way.  And madness well drives magic, while the flight/fight fits the sudden violent and panicked turns people take in fairy tales.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147507/#Comment_147507" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T01:08:18+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  1:08AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ogremarco</cite>I Ran some DRYH, which I've still never had a chance to play.

Everyone wants maximum win out of their con meals, they want to eat with the highest status, most beloved people they can.<br/><br/>That was never a problem for me this year, because all GPNW dining groups were automatically guaranteed to be excellent.  I didn't get to game with Laura or Mark or Mickey or Marcy or the I'm-Not-The-Theory-From-The-Closet guy but I did get to have a bite and a reconnect with them.  I got to know John Kim a bit better, which is very awesome because I've been reading his stuff for more than ten years, all the way back to rec.games.frp.advocacy.

Brandon, John, Phil and Tony, thank you so very much for pulling this together.  I know it is a challenging endeavor to organize something like this, and you all stepped up and made it happen.  Awesome.  <br/><br/>I really enjoyed running into people I met last year, and meeting new folks too.  With only a couple exceptions I gamed with all new folks, which is great!  But it also means I didn't get to sit across the table much with familiar faces.  I would have loved to throw down with Macklin, Johnzo, Chris, but it was great to see you guys again!<br/><br/>So, I really enjoyed my first ever game of Dogs, run by Carl.  Last year I had played his Zombies in the Vineyard, which was massively fun, but this was my first time actually playing a Dog.  Micah, my angry and defiant dog, turned out to be much softer on sinners than he was on his fellow Dog, which I find interesting in hindsight.<br/><br/>Then Phil ran a very fun Agon-Shadowrun playtest.  This was my first time to be a hero in Agon, rather than GM, and I really enjoyed how well the conversion pulls the gonzo Shadowrun stuff and fits it to Agon's structures as if it were custom made for it.  Very very cool, and I can't wait to see more on this.  Chaz the troll will rise again!<br/><br/>Sunday kicked off with a brutal game of Perfect.  I'm not sure how to bottle the lightning from that game, so I'll just say that it was exciting, shocking, and ultimately very sad.  I am struck in hindsight by the degree to which the characters <b>transformed</b> over the three hour(!) period, and by how the sincere tragedy stuck with me afterwards.  Plus, my old music teacher Samael Sharp was a total prick.<br/><br/>The last game for me was Wilson's Chien de le Terroir, a Dogs game set in the French revolution.  I almost didn't sign up for this game!  The setting intimidated me: I know little about the French revolution, and what little I knew was very unpleasant and presented few sympathetic figures on any side of the "conflict".  Also, I'd just played Dogs the day before.  But my mate Gareth was interested and I am so glad I didn't back down!  The presented alternate Terror was a good fit for the DitV structure, and Wilson efficiently presented just enough setting and ideology to get things set to pop.  Mon chein Henri was totally bought into the Council's authority and structures, and was all about bringing down the Wrath of Justice.  Really good stuff!<br/><br/>Now, that's a lot of gaming for me, and I was pretty much brain fried by the end of that fourth game.  I didn't make it to the last slot of either day, and obviously missed on on some wild times.  I really wish I knew how some of you keep it going hard-core!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthew_SB" title="Matthew_SB"><img alt="Matthew_SB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthew_SB">Matthew_SB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147686/#Comment_147686" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T12:27:03+00:00" title="June  3, 2008 12:27PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2008 1:03PM by Matthew_SB.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite>Sadness: aside from a short hallway conversation, Matthew S-B managed to elude me all con; next year, sir, you will not be so fortunate.</blockquote>\nWord and truth. : (<br/><br/>However, I hope to correct the EPIC FAIL of the last year, wherein I didn't reach out to the awesome peeps met at GPNW07 that live close enough to game with.

I really liked the new time slots, with a mix of 2, 3 and 4 slots. The 3 hour slots last year felt rushed to me, and I was very happy with the new arrangement. I also liked the advance signups, and how the sheets were printed out so there was flexibility for people to add or drop and instant visibility of current status of games to everyone looking for something to get into. I heard Ping was behind the signup printouts? Many thanks!<br><br>Friday night was very noisy dinner at Kai's, and then moving over to a lounge at the Deca hotel bar, which was quiet and lots of fun talking with folks until midnight.<br><br>Saturday morning I ran <em>Dogs in the Vineyard</em> for Will, Matt, John P, and Kingston. Daniel W was very kind about giving up his seat when the fourth signed up player arrived in the nick of time. A passing wagon train of non-faithful was disrupting the community. Kingston's Dog Brother William, an orphan from back east, wanted to pin the trouble on the non-Faithful doctor from back east who lived in the town and was well-liked, but wouldn't explain why, so there was a big argument in the steward's barn over "Does Brother William come clean about the Doctor?" against the other three Dogs, and in the end he gave and explained that the Doctor was his mother's brother, and had done nothing to help William's mother when William's father died, snubbing her. He wanted to punish the Doctor. The other Dogs refused to go along, so William threw his coat on the floor of the barn, and Brother Zebediah shot him in the back, killing him. (We were out of time but both players seemed happy with that result.)<br><br>In the next minute, The Doc was left unpurged, the wagon train was sold enough food to get them safely through the mountains but with the profits going to the steward to benefit the town instead of the greedy shopkeeper, and the men townsfolk who were planning to disguise themselves as Mountain Folk and massacre the wagon train once it camped away from the town were convinced not to do that terrible thing. William got to haunt his Uncle and brought his mother's ghost (whom he had relationship dice with) along to help with that.<br><br>Saturday afternoon I ran <em>Bliss Stage</em> for Nancy, Hans, Albert, and Jackson, as has been written elsewhere. There were many great moments in that, but I especially liked how veteran pilot Anna (played by Hans) had the opportunity to destroy the alien base herself but decided to leave that part for Keenan instead, because if someone wasn't going to come back from a mission she wanted that to be Keenan. Nice! So she slips out of the creche tank and tells him "Glory time, flyboy!" That was just great.<br><br>Keenan then plants the bomb at the alien base, half of which turns into a freaking MILE-HIGH GIANT. Keenan  hotshots to blow up the giant by flying up its cannon, and makes it home safely anyway.<br><br>Anna leaves the resistance cell with her baby and best friend Laura, "I gotta admit that asshole is a damn good pilot". Josh blisses out (118) and kills his asshole dad to become the new cell leader, and resolves the hope that we can raise a new generation, both on the outside with Anna, and inside the resistance cell with Keenan and his anchor's baby on the way. Whether we can ever understand or defeat the aliens is not yet known, but destroying their base bought enough time that maybe the next generation can grow up and win the war for humanity.<br><br>Then the Bliss Stage players and I went out to dinner with Ben Lehman and had a fascinating conversation about Bliss Stage, Polaris, and other matters. I sadly turned down an invitation to game in the evening slot, because there was no way I was going to make it to midnight, and wanted to get enough sleep to be able to run well Sunday. That's my only regret from the con, but it was still the right choice.<br><br>(continued...)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Carl" title="Carl"><img alt="Carl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Carl">Carl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147855/#Comment_147855" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T22:43:38+00:00" title="June  3, 2008 10:43PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Part 2 of 2)<br><br>Sunday morning (a 3 hour slot) I ran <em>Don't Rest Your Head</em><br><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6674" rel="nofollow">Mother When's Day</a> for Wilson, Jana, and Brendan, in which Brendan's drug dealer Donovan traded his compassion for the bullet that would kill him (Players: "Aggggh!") and Jana's fashion student traded her fear of dying alone and in pain for a potion of true love. Jana said she hadn't gamed (much?) before, but she picked up on things and was really great, so I hope she games lots more. Things wrapped successfully as they reached the High School, although with another hour more could have been done.  Remember, Don't Trust the Ravens.<br><br/>I grabbed a quick sandwich with Wilson and then on to <em>Lacuna part 1, The Creation of the Mystery and the Girl from Blue City (second attempt)</em>: Operation [omitted], details of which are not available in the public record. The character sheets were a big hit. I ran for Nancy, John Kim, Willem, and Rebecca and since none of them had played before (John had once read the rules, but kindly created a character who was better at doing than remembering), I offered them the once-per-lifetime choice of "the full Lacuna experience" or "Lacuna soft with training wheels" and they chose the full ticket, yay! <br/><br/>They did very well, accomplishing the primary mission, partial on the secondary, and [redacted] tertiary, with one casualty [redacted].  Final heart rates were 205, 166, 173, 0 (169).  15 Commendations.  12 [redacted].<br/><br/>I left Sunday evening last year but decided this year to fly home Monday, in case there might be a third game Sunday. Good call!<br/><br/>Following a quick dinner at Kai's, I proposed running DRYH again (zero prep HURRAH!) and Wilson rounded up Mickey and Daniel. I'm very pleased that Daniel managed to get into one of my games after he was so nice about it twice before, and I had a wonderful time wrapping up the convention with their Bedtime Story, as has been related elsewhere.  I particularly liked how Lucas risked his life for the complete strangers who'd taken the place of his own family, and how the two PCs who had run away from an Indiana orphanage so long ago risked everything to help a complete stranger get his children back, and how they all rejected various offers that would have saved some of them but not all. Nobody was abandoned, so everyone got the happy ending they deserved.<br/><br/>Lucas: "You can't ask me to choose between my son and daughter, to sacrifice one to save the other!  I love them both!"<br/>School Girl Guide: "In the Mad City you have to make those choices Every. Fucking. DAY!"<br/><br/>The game wrapped around 10 but I wasn't sleepy, so talked with a dozen or so folks who didn't have to leave yet, marveling at all the other wonders I'd missed, and then hung around the hotel lobby comparing notes with Wilson until 4am, when I staggered upstairs to sleep.<br/><br/>I handed out a few cards but not enough, so if anyone from my games (or not) would like to get in touch to offer feedback (good or bad) or just say hi, my email address is cdr at telemancy.com, and I'd love to hear from you.  I hope to play again with all of you, and to someday play with all the other great players I didn't get to this time.<br/><br/>I'm reading all the GPNW threads voraciously, and would love to hear more about how the Shadowrun Agon and any other DRYH games went.<br/><br/>Again, many thanks to John and Tony and everyone who made it such a great time!                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148001/#Comment_148001" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T08:07:32+00:00" title="June  4, 2008  8:07AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to clarify and spread the shout outs around: Phil LaRose and Brandon Amancio also deserve huge credit as organizers for Go Play NW.

Well, I think I did browbeat him a bit into joining us, so maybe I get that credit!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThose schoolgirl comments were intense at that moment.  I can't recall but Carl may have preceded them with something such as "what makes you so special" to Lucas, regardless they were chilling to me as they painted the picture of just how desperate and dangerous life in this world truly is, plus it also made me feel badly for the schoolgirl as it seemed to me that while she was resigned to life here, she probably was rather unhappy/seriously under pressure ongoing, and revealed depth in her character finally, that she wasn't just a scheming teenager not particularly concerned with how she affected anyone but fighting for her life and trying to put up a good front in the hellish environment of Mad City and especially the school.  I had pointed out this quote and its effect to Carl in our conversations late Sunday evening/Monday AM, and I'm glad he posted this.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I also bow to our almighty GPNW organizers!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/willem" title="willem"><img alt="willem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/willem">willem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148146/#Comment_148146" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T14:19:50+00:00" title="June  4, 2008  2:19PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Totally, from me too, thanks to Tony, Brandon, Phil, Ping, and John for everything they did to make it happen.

I definitely enjoyed gaming with you (though I have to say, I really enjoyed gaming with everyone - though not everyone's a Dog/Chien who called on the demons!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zornwil" title="zornwil"><img alt="zornwil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zornwil">zornwil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148283/#Comment_148283" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-05T00:27:54+00:00" title="June  5, 2008 12:27AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>Set yourself to HTML to fix the quoting.</blockquote>\nD'oh, I get it  now, I see, below where one enters comments<br/><br/>Thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148377/#Comment_148377" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-05T10:00:57+00:00" title="June  5, 2008 10:00AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, I finished my write-ups, posted on my LiveJournal as <br/><br/><a href="http://jhkimrpg.livejournal.com/69494.html" rel="nofollow"><b>Go Play NorthWest 2008</b></a><br/><br/>Comments welcome...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148915/#Comment_148915" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-08T22:01:22+00:00" title="June  8, 2008 10:01PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Welcome to story games Chad!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bzarhands</cite><strong>Destructicus Prime</strong>: a toy-based smash-up that opened with Ben launching a tank off a ramp (landing on and then smearing an entire dimetrodon across the arena) and concluded with three players so desperate for glory they attempted called-shots to a volcano--with their own vehicles.</blockquote>\nTony never told me tanks couldn't ride dinosaurs.
