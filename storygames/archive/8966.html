No idea if I'll finish or not.<br/><br/>As a judge, you're warned. If you read this thread, you made me break the rules. It's not my fault, it's your fault. Also, you'll spoil the surprise.<br/><br/>So, to start with, I find the basic theme interesting, but the ingredients are totally bleh. They either lend themselves to totally gamechef cruft ("seahorses! I used two at once!" vomit) or random fantasy cruft, which is all well and good but I have no patience for designing it at this point. It's all very meh.<br/><br/>It struck me that I should do the opposite of the ingredients, which does involve finding an opposite for "horse." The others are easy: Mountain, Noon, and Quench. Ah, that's much better. Let's say that the opposite for "horse" is "dog," as they are the two earliest domesticated animals. Or something. Now we have, for nega-game chef: Mountain, Noon, Quench, and Dog.<br/><br/>Much, much better.<br/><br/>I've been wanting to write a game based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yotsuba&amp;!" rel="nofollow">Yotsuba-to!</a> for a while. A "fantasy of perfect childhood" game, basically. That seems like a good idea. I've also wanted to make a game that can be played one player or more.<br/><br/>So you have the Girl. She's five, not yet in kindergarten, and totally into everything. She goes out, meets friends, and has adventures.<br/>You have the Dad, who the girl tells about her adventures and sometimes goes with her.<br/>You have Friends, who vary by adventure.<br/><br/>Basic adventure should be "go to a place, do several activities, go home." You should be able to have scary things happen and also to fail at some things, but not at everything. Failure should be a chance for more role-play, not less.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198156/#Comment_198156" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-21T11:40:03+00:00" title="March 21, 2009 11:40AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A week isn't a lot of time, even if you come from the Game Chef old-school and believe that playtesting your rough draft is an exercise in arrogant wankery, so let's get rolling.<br/><br/>If you have one player, you have the Girl, alone, going out on an adventure.<br/>If you have two players, you have the Girl and her Dad when she's at home, the Girl and one Friend when she's away.<br/>With three or more players, the Dad can come along or can change roles so you can have more than one Friend at once.<br/><br/>Something which worked well in my game about ninja's is questioning about the environment. We'll submit to patriarchal authority and say that the Dad player also gets to answer questions about the environment, and other people answer questions about their internal world. The Dad's internal world is mysterious. For the one player, of course, the one player has to do all the asking and answer herself.<br/><br/>Questions about the environment:<br/>"What kind of bugs are they?"<br/>"What's the color of the leaves?"<br/>"Is it a friendly cat?"<br/><br/>Questions about your internal world:<br/>"Are you getting hungry?"<br/>"How do you feel?"<br/>"Is it easy or hard?"<br/>"What's that a picture of?"<br/><br/>So what's the basic process of play?<br/>You have the Girl, she's in a place.<br/>Describe the place.<br/>The Girl asks questions about the place, which are answered or not.<br/>If there's a friend in the place, they're doing something. The girl joins or not.<br/>The Girl leaves when this is over.<br/><br/>Activities:<br/>You can do well at them or poorly.<br/>Regardless, you can have fun.<br/>You can bring in other people.<br/>You ask questions about them, too.<br/>When they're over, either leave or move to another activity.<br/><br/>So basically, places and activities are an overlapping chain, united by Friends (and Dad), with possible breaks if you get bored.<br/><br/>I think that there should be die-rolling, but it needs to be simple, because I'd like the game to be played in real time. Maybe just 4-6 on a d6 (a coin flip, but easier.) "Roll High" to overcome the natural course of things (if something is hard, and you want to do well, you must roll high to do it well. If a friend asks you to do something, and you don't want to, you must roll high to overcome your natural enthusiasm for everything.) That seems like a pretty good way to throw in disruptions.<br/><br/>Any thoughts from the peanut gallery so far?<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198162/#Comment_198162" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-21T12:38:26+00:00" title="March 21, 2009 12:38PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Map of Nearby Places:<br/><br/>Home<br/>-&gt; Street outside<br/>-&gt; Backyard<br/><br/>Street outside<br/>-&gt; Home<br/>-&gt; Neighbor's house<br/>-&gt; Park down the street<br/>-&gt; The bus<br/><br/>Backyard<br/>-&gt; Home<br/>-&gt; Neighbor's backyard<br/><br/>Neighbor's backyard<br/>-&gt; Backyard<br/>-&gt; Treehouse<br/>-&gt; Neighbor's house<br/><br/>Other places, that you can only go to during an activity:<br/>The mountains<br/>The beach<br/>The high school<br/>The zoo<br/>The museum<br/>Downtown<br/>The store<br/>Mac's Florist job                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198171/#Comment_198171" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-21T13:15:27+00:00" title="March 21, 2009  1:15PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So you're the girl.<br/>You enter a new place. Ask at least three questions about the place. Answers can be a description or an "I don't know, why don't you find out" in which case you have to act and ask again.<br/>The girl is asked one question about herself. Or more.<br/>Then the girl says what she's doing. This will lead to more questions (one external, one internal, minimum).<br/><br/>Special Questions for the Girl:<br/>"Is it hard?" If it's hard, you won't do it well. If you want to do it well, roll high.<br/>"Is it easy?" If it's easy you'll do it right the first time. If you want to do it poorly, roll high.<br/>"Is it scary?" If it's scary, you'll be afraid of it. If you want to be brave, roll high.<br/>"Do you want to come along? / Do you want to help?" You do! If you want to be not interested, roll high.<br/>"Are you bored?" If you're bored, it's time to do something else. If you want to keep doing it, roll high.<br/>"Are you getting hungry?" If you are, you should go home and eat a snack with your Dad. Tell him about what you did when you do.<br/><br/>If there's a friend there, also ask questions of them. But friends always fail hard things, and always succeed in easy things, and so on.<br/><br/>Keep going until you're back home and done playing for the day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198176/#Comment_198176" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-21T14:45:18+00:00" title="March 21, 2009  2:45PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 21, 2009 4:22PM by Graham.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I opened this thread because I thought Ben was going to warn me about something.

And then I thought, how do you build a game around that.<br/><br/>The ingredients don't do anything for me. So, I guess my game will have no resolutions mechanism, you won't by able do anything to any other player and the players have to pretend that they're riding horses between the sea and a fire with buckets of water to put out a fire that will burn the village down by midnight if it isn't put out.<br/><br/>Here's my entry.<br/><br/><b>Use the Sea to Put Out the Fire before Midnight and You Ride Horses</b><br/><br/>Play pretend that you're riding horses between the sea and a fire with buckets of water to put out a fire that will burn the village down by midnight if it isn't put out.<br/><br/>Each player goes a round. During a round the other players come up with obstacles that you have to get around. Tell everyone how you do that. They can help you out too as long as you ask them to do something.<br/><br/>The fire is put out by the player with the most awesome story. You'll know it when you see it.<br/><br/>Wow! Game done. Sweet and it fits on a notecard, so I wonder if I qualify for the Harper award.<br/><br/><i>Playtest one went well. Figuring out who won isn't very immersive-like, so that rule is droped. New rule: Play until you're bored or until someone makes a story so stunning that everyone is satisfied that the fire is out.

I have tried to make games based on similar concepts over the past 6 years (even before I stumbled across that comic and others like it, such as Aqua and Aria). Keeping it to the limited Yotsuba&amp;! premise, it's like being a tourist in your own culture. Playing such a game can open your eyes to things you'd overlooked in the world just outside your own door in reality. After that, it's just addictive as you use the game to share what you've seen with your friends. Can you tell I'm looking forwards to your game?<br/><br/>As for my progress in the contest, at first I had the same reaction to the ingredients as you did, garbage fantasy or game contest "cruft." I stuck with them, though, and was glad I did. It wasn't until I had a soundtrack put together for the game that I was sure I had the idea that would become my entry.<br/><br/>Now, the standard disclaimer and warning.

I have a blog of sorts, but I doubt anyone will Register to post comments on it, when they might have one thing to say about this point I'm making.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>So I found a mechanical way to use Burn--you actually burn your character sheet slightly, upon failing a challenge. What's a challenge? That's half of the immersion factor: you determine who gets Burned by taking turns trying to do something with an object--like in the basketball challenge game of HORSE. So I challenge you by saying, "I can hit that tree from here with a rock" and you must try, or Burn your Head in shame. (head is a part of the character sheet).<br/><br/>Why are we doing this? because we are all portraying members of an island tribe who, at midnight, will vote to sacrifice one tribe member to the sea gods (YEP! Used all four!). So, basically, it's a LARP (that's the other half of immersion) that's designed to be played in an evening, like a party game. Ideally outdoors or where each person has some means of catching ash (or, maybe, in a basement where a bit of ash doesn't matter).<br/><br/><a href="http://davidartman.com/games/the-sea-worshippers" rel="nofollow">Link to PDF</a>, which I haven't yet submitted                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198501/#Comment_198501" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-24T08:28:56+00:00" title="March 24, 2009  8:28AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David: Neat!<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198536/#Comment_198536" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-24T10:34:48+00:00" title="March 24, 2009 10:34AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, since I'm also designing a LARP in which a mechanic requires players to burn pieces of paper, I'd like to chime in to say I did not steal the idea from you.

I'll try to include them in the next draft.<br/><br/>In the one-player game, the player plays all four roles, building sets of complications, taking turns for each protagonist as normal, and rolling when he wants a complication.  I guess I'm not sure what else I need to add.  I don't think it would be as fun as playing with multiple people, but it's certainly doable and might be fun for a little while. <br/><br/>There will be a bunch of example complications, I just don't think I can fit them into the two-page version of the game.  I'm not sure what you mean by "each area."  Depending on how you define an "area," that could be a lot of examples.  You're right that there should be more advice on making good complications, so if I can find any place to cut some text, that's what I'll add.<br/><br/>The rules already suggest that having more than three dots should be rare, so I'd probably move from infinite to three dots and then let things develop from there.  Maybe I should just say that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198812/#Comment_198812" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-25T19:33:47+00:00" title="March 25, 2009  7:33PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Maybe I should just say that.</i><br/><br/>Yeah, that would be better.

Here are some thoughts:<br/><br/>Not having read the comics, I'm not at all sure how to make the girl's everyday adventures interesting.  Where is the fun found?  Is it in the interesting people she meets?  Is it in the interesting things that she does?  Is it in seeing how she reacts to new things?  Like your suggestion to talk more about complications, I think you need to talk more about framing interesting environments for her to be in or interesting things for her to do and discover.  Your lists help a little, but I can imagine, say, going to the beach and being like, "Okay, I play in the water, I guess, and then build a sandcastle," which isn't that exciting to say, without some give-and-take between the players about something significant, like, uh, "You see a strange creature moving sideways along the beach.  It has stopped to investigate your lunch."  And then she can discover a crab and be freaked out or not and that would be interesting.<br/><br/>I'm also a bit dubious that the die rolls really add a lot.  What's their purpose? To model the girl's fickle attention span?  It seems like a lot of the rolls are phrased, "If you want to do X, roll," indicating that many rolls may not happen if the player is fine going along with whatever's happening.  Are they there to mitigate the Dad's ritual phrases, so they're strong suggestions rather than commands?  That's more interesting, but I kinda wish there was another way to do that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson" title="Ben_Johnson"><img alt="Ben_Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/2131054135_2403ed15ce_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson">Ben_Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198954/#Comment_198954" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-26T15:13:23+00:00" title="March 26, 2009  3:13PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd just like to say that "Horse" allows me to finally have an avenue for the Bella Sara RPG I've been dying to write.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198975/#Comment_198975" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-26T16:51:16+00:00" title="March 26, 2009  4:51PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everybody...

I mean I'll happily admit that my entry is pretty much the epitome of what you'd call 'cruft', but... eh... a game where you play a little girl going around the place doing nebulous things? Sorry, no offence or anything, but I just don't get where the fascination is. It sounds rather bland to me, as does the manga from the brief description on the link you provided, so I guess I'm not the target audience anyway.<br/><br/>What I'm really asking is what, in your opinion, is the big draw that would make people want to play this game?<br/><br/>Other comments:<br/>Having to roll to <i>not </i>do something can be annoying as it takes control of the character away from the player. Some people like it, some just get irritated when they do something stupid through no fault of their own. May I recommend that you either augment or replace the 'roll to resist helping' mechanic with some kind of reward system instead? If you make it inconvenient for players to help others, but give something nice for doing so, players will want to help others and you won't have to force them.<br/><br/>From what I could gather about the Manga, it's primarily about the little girl learning important life lessons. Perhaps some element of learning should be incorporated into the game's structure, if it isn't already?<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199025/#Comment_199025" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-27T02:46:26+00:00" title="March 27, 2009  2:46AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2009 2:54AM by Graham.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm glad people are progressing with their games, but I do wish you'd stop posting to this thread and write games, instead.

This sharing of ideas <i>is</i> design. Communication helps us gain insight into our own ideas, clarify how we communicate them, and refine them (or even push us to seek new paths). That's all part of the process of design. Want proof? Ben's going to be submitting a game that was designed using this thread.<br/><br/>Our blogs are the same thing as this thread, just elsewhere. So are our playtests. Our chats with friends and relatives offline. Everything you've not only allowed, but encouraged. The only difference here is that you're more aware of it because it's where you can see it. What I don't understand is how you're not seeing the design process that's happening here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199042/#Comment_199042" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-27T06:13:20+00:00" title="March 27, 2009  6:13AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham, my game is done, so I read Ben's (which he asked us to) and commented on it, since he offered helpful comments on mine.  You're complaining about something that isn't happening.  This is barely a discussion thread at all.  There have been like four or five substantive comments and the rest are just people encouraging each other, which I think is awesome.  As far as I can see, all design work is happening elsewhere.<br/><br/>You're not even supposed to be reading this thread.  So, with all due respect, <i>go away</i>.  Comment in the original thread, if you think people are fucking up your contest.  Honestly, this isn't about you or what you want, really; it's about people making cool games in whatever way works best for them.  I wish more contest organizers would realize that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199048/#Comment_199048" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-27T06:40:31+00:00" title="March 27, 2009  6:40AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2009 6:45AM by Graham.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm trying to be gently encouraging for people to write games rather than post.
