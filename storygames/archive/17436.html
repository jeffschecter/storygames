That's not important here, but what is is that during one session she had her character flirt with a guard to try and get past him, or something similar. The group told her she did a terrible job flirting, which wasn't nice, but the dice said quite definitively that she had achieved her objective.<br/><br/>Now there is a lot of discussion out there about whether the primary element to determine outcomes should be game mechanics or player ability, which I will for this discussion ignore. Some games tell the GM to give bonuses for good roleplaying too, but I don't like that either, because what IS good roleplaying? And I don't like games where all the roleplaying can be replaced with a die roll + token description.<br/><br/>The thing is that if you consider BOTH types of input equally, something interesting emerges: It creates fiction and complications! For example, IF the guard let her pass, AND she did a terrible job of flirting, then WHY did he let her pass? Was it because he found the clumsy flirting cute? Is it because he's happy that any woman at all is bothering to talk to him? Is it because he's on to her and leading the team into a trap? The intersection between what the dice say and what the player does is actually a rich reservoir of ideas I rarely see tapped.<br/><br/>The resistance to this idea comes entirely from players who don't like the idea of character actions creating 'facts'. Personally, I prefer to think of it as 'revealing' facts nobody knew, including the GM. And this idea doesn't exclude the possibility of having established and/or secret facts only the GM has say over either, though this does little to sway the resistance's staunchest supporters.<br/><br/>The problem I have with it is that it doesn't allow for <i>tactics</i>. A player can't take facts into consideration to gain leverage because those facts don't 'exist' yet. But perhaps this is also something that does not exclude the possibility of such advantages. In fact, perhaps establishing facts can be part of the game and used to make things more or less possible.<br/><br/>But the core problem though is how is the WHY revealed in the first place? If the guard is afraid of women, then they may act a certain way, but how does the character <i>know</i> that being afraid of women is the <i>reason</i> for the action? This has stumped me for literally the past three years, and I'm dearly hoping Metatopia provides the lateral thinking I need to finally resolve it. And it's a curious thing, but I'd say a significant portion of the facts in the fiction are communicated between the Player and GM, and not through the character's observations, even in 'immersive' games.<br/><br/>Finally, a system like this needs a clear division between action and intent. In other words, the player must be able to express the intent separately from their character's action. I find this troublesome because the difference between action and intent in RPGs is entirely arbitrary. Is there a more or less effective way to divide them? Most RPGs for example divide an attack into a 'take your shot' action and 'hit your target' intent, but you could just as easily treat 'taking your shot' as the intent, and 'readying your weapon' as the action. I think how you choose to divide things goes a long way to defining how your game feels and what it's about.<br/><br/>And if any of these ideas weren't clear, join the club. This is still very much a "I know its there because I see its impact/potential but I haven't quite figured out how to put it in a bottle yet" for me too. I will also end on a completely unrelated note by saying that I find it surprising yet not shocking that Jared Sorensen is friends with people I'm friends with outside of gaming. Why it's surprising is probably a sad testament to my inability to believe that game designers such as myself do anything BUT game design, in a small underground office, where they will be undistracted by things such as sunlight or oxygen.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/doho123" title="doho123"><img alt="doho123" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/doho123">doho123</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394725/#Comment_394725" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-25T05:17:33+00:00" title="October 25, 2012  5:17AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would argue that a lot of this would fall under the realm of a DM who can take things that happen during the role-play part and weave them back into the game. The game shouldn't just be a series of obstacles that are there to be overcome...but a series of events with outcomes (potential unforeseen) that can be called back later into the game.<br/><br/>In your example with guard above, a good DM should take that guard and weave him back into the game as a NPC who has become smitten with the woman who flirted with him, showing up and offering her flowers at oddball times and generally being a humorous nuisance.<br/><br/>****<br/>Of course, the first paragraph is a pretty terrible story. I wonder how many people in the group actually could handle a real sword or actively describe the use of one, but certainly don't mind the big dice rolls for amazing hits.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394727/#Comment_394727" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-25T05:22:39+00:00" title="October 25, 2012  5:22AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The resistance to this idea comes entirely from players who don't like the idea of character actions creating 'facts'.</blockquote>\nYour topic spans over a some areas. First of all, like you say here, it depends on the style of the game. Is the world something like the GM's doll house where the players has do learn and adopt or is the world something that players can contribute to in a sort of collaborate storytelling?\n<blockquote>But the core problem though is how is the WHY revealed in the first place?

That would mean that any kind of seduction act from a woman would be pointless. Should the GM raise the difficulty for the action? What does it mean if the character still succeed with the act?<br/><br/>When I do a kind of collaborate storytelling and play it diceless, but with skill values, I ask for the skill and if it's high enough, I will respond well on the flirtyness. If it's low, I pretend to be completely uninterested.<br/><br/>The thing is, if you as a GM think of the world as a doll house, and the guard is gay, you would probably let the seduction action to automatically fail, but play out a gayish guard to show the player why her action failed.\n<blockquote>...then WHY did he let her pass?

In other words, the player must be able to express the intent separately from their character's action.</blockquote>\nWhat you are talking about is actually how the game mechanic is expressed in the world. There are normally two ways to handle this.<br/><br/>intent --&gt; description --&gt; mechanic --&gt; consequence<br/><br/>The player give away her intent through a description, then she use the mechanic to see if it has any effect (success or failure) and lastly how it turns out. Usually the GM tells the consequence, no matter if the action is successful or a failure.  This is usually how doll house games works. Another way to handle it could be:<br/><br/>intent --&gt; mechanic --&gt; description<br/><br/>The player declare her intent, then use the mechanic and after that describe how the intent and mechanic works together to create an effect in the world. With this method, it's the outcome of the mechanic that choose who gets to do the description of the action. If it fails, the GM describes and if it's a success, the player describes. This is more of a collaborate storytelling.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>So at least two things are something you have to consider:<br/>- Your game style. Doll house or collaborate?<br/>- The game style affects how you use the mechanics: should the description be before (doll house) the mechanic or after (collaborate)?<br/><br/>It's a matter of taste of what you use, but you shouldn't mix it together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_394742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394742/#Comment_394742" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-25T07:21:31+00:00" title="October 25, 2012  7:21AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 25, 2012 7:22AM by AnonAdderlan.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Is the world something like the GM's doll house where the players has do learn and adopt or is the world something that players can contribute to in a sort of collaborate storytelling?</blockquote>\nYes.<br/><br/>Or less sarcastically, I see no reason why it can't be both.\n<blockquote>I've been in this discussion before and the example that came up was if the guard was gay.

Apparently there are many things I do not like.<br/><br/>Now if the guard was gay then she wouldn't succeed because of sexual arousal or interest, but she <i>could</i> succeed if the guard identified with her and saw in her another person marginalized by society for who they really were (which considering the group would <i>totally</i> make sense).<br/><br/>You encounter a similar problem if you're trying to scare a robot. A robot has no emotions, so perhaps it is not reacting to its existential turmoil, but simply mistranslating the sudden action it sees in front of it (and I have seen robots 'scared' this way). Then again, perhaps only a robot can truly appreciate the full scope of the existential horror we all face.\n<blockquote>When I do a kind of collaborate storytelling and play it diceless, but with skill values, I ask for the skill and if it's high enough, I will respond well on the flirtyness. If it's low, I pretend to be completely uninterested.</blockquote>\nHigh? Low? Compared to what? Compared to <i>who</i>? And how much of an impact does player input make?<br/><br/>Most social skills are also a matter of context rather than magnitude anyway. Qualities over quantities. So if I'm flirting with my kind of people, I do fantastic, but I'm gonna get my ass kicked if I try the same shit on the Jersey Shore. Then again, basic PUI techniques are horrifically formulaic, which just goes to show that either I love arguing with myself or have no consistent worldview whatsoever.\n<blockquote>What you are talking about is actually how the game mechanic is expressed in the world.</blockquote>\nIf by that you mean I've designed and run RPGs which do not differentiate between intent and action, then yes. These games featured attacks which consisted of single "I raise my sword over and hack its head off" action descriptions where the intent was explicitly part of the description. And because of that the dynamic changed slightly.<br/><br/>Now we got two axes:<br/><br/><b>Action totally Fails ---&gt; Action partially Succeeds (or partially Fails, but I'm an optimist) ---&gt; Action totally Succeeds</b><br/><br/>and<br/><br/><b>Nothing else happens ---&gt; Something else happens ---&gt; EVERYTHING else Happens (which we never get to thanks to calculus)</b><br/><br/>But that's a totally different kettle of bats from what I'm trying to work out here, which does depend on the action/intent split.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394756/#Comment_394756" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-25T08:26:42+00:00" title="October 25, 2012  8:26AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Or less sarcastically, I see no reason why it can't be both.</blockquote>\nThen you got problems. "What kind of problems?", you might think. The ones that you wrote about in your first post.<br/><br/>I will now answer to clarify my previous post.\n<blockquote><blockquote>I've been in this discussion before and the example that came up was if the guard was gay. That would mean that any kind of seduction act from a woman would be pointless. Should the GM raise the difficulty for the action? What does it mean if the character still succeed with the act?</blockquote>\nI do not like difficulty numbers either. </blockquote>\nI never wrote "difficulty number". I wrote "raise the difficulty" so my text can be system neutral.\n<blockquote><blockquote>When I do a kind of collaborate storytelling and play it diceless, but with skill values, I ask for the skill and if it's high enough, I will respond well on the flirtyness. If it's low, I pretend to be completely uninterested.</blockquote>\nHigh? Low? Compared to what? Compared to <i>who</i>? And how much of an impact does player input make?</blockquote>\nDoes it matter? Again, I held it system neutral in a fictive example. But OK. In this example, I thought the system gave guidelines to what is high/low and the GM used that to make a decision.<br/><br/>Now to the interesting question about player input for this particular way of using a system. The player should give just the right amount of input so that the GM feels that the player is making an effort. It doesn't have to be the world's best seduction, but it has to be <i>an attempt</i> to a seduction.\n<blockquote><blockquote>What you are talking about is actually how the game mechanic is expressed in the world.</blockquote>\nIf by that you mean I've designed and run RPGs which do not differentiate between intent and action, then yes. </blockquote>\nNo, I didn't mean that. What I meant was that it's two different things if the player declare her actions like this.<br/><br/>1. Player: - I walk up to the guard and say "Hey, cutie. [bla, bla, bla]"<br/>2. * The mechanic is used in some way. *<br/>3a. GM (if the character is successful): - "Sure, hun. I will let you in"<br/>3b. GM (if the character is failing): - "Beat it!"<br/><br/>OR you could use a structure where the participants (player or GM) have to explain how the outcome of how the mechanic is affecting the world.<br/><br/>1. Player: - I want to pass the guard and I use my seduction skill. (intent)<br/>2. * The mechanic is used in some way. *<br/>3a. Player (if the character is successful): - It's actually an old one-night-stand. "Hey, Peter. What's up? ..."<br/>3b. GM (if the character is failing): - Before you arrive a girl comes up to the guard and gives him a light kiss. They stand there and talk for a while.<br/><br/>In the second example, nothing has really happen in the world after the mechanic has been resolved. We just got the player's intention and an outcome. Those two has to come together with a description in the third point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394880/#Comment_394880" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-25T23:06:56+00:00" title="October 25, 2012 11:06PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some interesting (and useful!) stuff here, but I keep wondering...what about the player character in all of this?<br/><br/>It's really not uncommon for people to play characters who are good at things that they themselves are not, like fighting, or science, or public speaking, or, yes, flirting.

And if it does, there's something wrong. And while most RPGs account for things like physics, feats, and movement, more complex and sublime forms of fictional positing are usually extremely difficult if not outright possible.\n<blockquote>(You might actually consider taking the question up with the people you play with.

And just because a GM CAN, does not mean a GM SHOULD, override player contributions. If it's a murder mystery, then only the facts pertaining to the murder mystery should be corrected for.<br/><br/>Basically, instead of applying a perception ability, a player attempts to make a change in the world, and <i>failing</i> to do so <i>reveals</i> something about the world. This is a dynamic I definitely want in my games, but I haven't quite figured out how to get it yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395269/#Comment_395269" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-29T10:59:00+00:00" title="October 29, 2012 10:59AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Since I think I'm safe from the 'game designer telling players how to play' arguments here, of course it's about the players, but shouldn't this fundamental issue be accounted for in the rules?</blockquote>\nI'm not sure it's possible for any rules to completely cover it, to be honest. At least, I've never seen any.<br/><br/>Which perhaps doesn't mean you shouldn't try to invent such rules, but if you do, I still think it's worth considering how to handle players who <i>want</i> what their character can do to trump what they say as a player, or vice versa.

This is one of the reasons why I removed the following things from my game (mostly)\u2026<br/><br/>Social Attributes<br/>Mental Attributes<br/><br/>well\u2026\xa0to hell\u2026\xa0I removed all the classic attributes. <br/><br/>I still have tangible actions to affect the world, but I always thought social/mental skills were a very problematic point for player characters. I have played in groups that have allowed unskilled characters do all the talking, because the player was a brilliant speaker. And I've seen socially skilled characters run into one faux pas after another because the players were incapable of the finer nuances in socialisation.<br/><br/>There are some systems out there that try to remove those aspects of the game, so players are free to play however they want. I'm not saying this is an elegant approach, but it tries to be fair. Players invest points in skills, and they should get something out of it. If you build a socializing character, but are clumsy in your player skill, I think it shouldn't matter too much. It has been said by others too: no one expects the player of a fighter to take fencing classes. <br/><br/>Why are we comfortable with combat rules, and unwilling to apply similar abstractions in other cases?<br/><br/>If planning (problem solving, mental skills) and dialogue are suddenly a matter of skill points, they better be worth it. Others (lacking those skills) should not get their way because they have a player skill. <br/><br/>After all, that's not great storytelling either.  <br/><br/>Hope my thoughts aren't too confusing. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
