It's got me thinking of some of the stupid arguments about definitions.  \n<blockquote>They've got their little categories, like 'conscious' and 'gangsta'. It used to be a thing where hip-hop was all together. Fresh Prince would be on tour with N.W.A. It wasn't like, 'You have got to like me in order for me to like you.' That's just some more white folks trying to think that all niggas are alike, and now it's expanded. It used to be one type of nigga; now it's two. There is so much more dimension to who we are. A monolith is a monolith, even if there's two monoliths to choose from. I ain't mad at Snoop. I'm not mad at Master P. I ain't mad at the Hot Boys. I'm mad when that's all I see. I would be mad if I looked up and all I saw on TV was me or Common or The Roots, because I know that ain't the whole deal. The real joy is when you can kick it with everyone. That's what hip-hop is all about. ... They keep trying to slip the 'conscious rapper' thing on me. I come from Roosevelt Projects, man. The ghetto. I drank the same sugar water, ate hard candy. And they try to get me because I'm supposed to be more articulate, I'm supposed to be not like the other Negroes, to get me to say something against my brothers. I'm not going out like that, man.[3]</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267277/#Comment_267277" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-15T09:02:58+00:00" title="April 15, 2010  9:02AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Word up!<br/><br/>We are all gangstah!<br/><br/>Break down those motherfucking silos!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267279/#Comment_267279" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-15T09:13:40+00:00" title="April 15, 2010  9:13AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am a storygamah!

I went to last.fm and typed in 'dead prez' and scrolled down to 'find similar artists' and clicked that.<br/><br/>2. There was a large overlap with the list of Conscious Rappers found at the bottom of the wikipedia page Rob cited.<br/>There were 25 more pages of recommendations, with everything from Sage Francis to X-Clan to Tupac.   The last group on the 25th page of rec's was a group that includes stic.man from Dead Prez, FWIW.<br/><br/>3. I guess if you looked up Jason Morningstar's youtube videos, and then clicked on the other videos youtube recommends-- that would be sorta the same.   The tag-based classification system joepub recommends seems similar.<br/>Asking a knowledgeable rap fan/ game player would yield more personalized results, but their data-base of knowledge would be less defined.   A system that segregated by hard indie/trad or old/new boundaries would eliminate many of last.fm's recs. But such a system might also have more-directly pointed Robert toward what he seeks.<br/><br/>Do you want more baby, or less bathwater?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267359/#Comment_267359" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-15T16:40:45+00:00" title="April 15, 2010  4:40PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Todd L</cite>Here's a little experiment: YOU try to find groups "like" the ones Mr. Bohl's looking for.<br/><br/>1. Describe your process?<br/>2. How well did it work?<br/>3. What if you tried to find games in a similar way?</blockquote>\nHere's how I would recommend artists to Rob:<br/><br/>A.) I would think of all the artists I know who've collaborated with Mos Def, Black Star &amp; Dead Prez.<br/><br/>Since I know that Black Star is Talib Kweli &amp; Mos Def, I'd recommend Rob go and listen to Talib Kweli, probably starting with "Just To Get By".<br/>I think Mos Def and Erykah Badu have collaborated, and so recommend her too.<br/><br/>I'm feeling like this is a solid, but very limited, approach.<br/><br/>It'd work with games, too. I know that I like Jason Morningstar's games. If he collaborates with a guy named Vladamir Glitterdust, I should probably check out the games old Vlad has published too.<br/><br/>B.) I would think of all the artists I listen to when I'm in a "Mos Def-ish mood", or that I'd put on a mix with Rob's artists.<br/><br/>That brings up: Common, Atmosphere, Sage Francis, K'naan, 2mex, Jedi Mind Tricks, Talib Kweli, Kanye West and Citizens of Sleep, Buck 65.<br/><br/>This is a pretty good approach, but it's coloured heavily by my own preferences. For example, I purposely omitted Black Ice because I don't like him, and I included Citizens of Sleep because they're my friends. I included Kanye West even though he didn't exactly meet Rob's criterion.<br/><br/>This is a pretty good approach to games, but is even-more-likely to be biased and twisted by the recommender.<br/><br/>C.) I would attach genre labels to the artists Rob named, and then I'd run a mental scan for other "socially-conscious hip hop artists".<br/><br/>I come up with: Common, Atmosphere/Slug, Sage Francis, Saul Williams, Citizens of Sleep, K'naan, 2mex, Black Ice, Buck 65.<br/><br/>This list includes artists I don't actually like, and omits artists I really like, because I'm paying lots of mind to "genre boundaries". Does Kanye West or Jedi Mind Tricks belong here? No, even though I'd recommend them to someone who likes Mos Def &amp; Black Star.<br/><br/><br/><br/>CONCLUSION<br/><br/>I would only consider Erykah Badu through method A, would only consider Kanye West through method B, and would only consider Saul Williams through method C.<br/>Otherwise, the list is largely the same.<br/><br/>A is limited, B is biased, and C isn't reflective of my preferences necessarily.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267360/#Comment_267360" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-15T17:32:41+00:00" title="April 15, 2010  5:32PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I came into this thread expecting Mr. Def talking about his experiences in 16 Blocks and Hitchhiker's Guide... oh well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267374/#Comment_267374" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-15T18:47:45+00:00" title="April 15, 2010  6:47PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd watch Dave Chappelle's Block Party, because Dead Prez totally kick ass in that one (that version of Hip Hop is sooooo much better than the original).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267376/#Comment_267376" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-15T19:02:50+00:00" title="April 15, 2010  7:02PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On a more serious note: as much as I respect Mos Def, I disagree with his point a bit.

(and, thus, cLOUDDEAD) are some of the best avant garde hip-hop artists around.

Even so, that first cLOUDDEAD record plus Oaklandazulasylum and the early Subtle albums are super great.<br/><br/><i>i can gather myself once as a very fairly small human,<br/>mouth made out of glass. i am my habitat,<br/>antidote and what ripped his face off wasn't even a pain killer,<br/>faceless and a boyish numb uncomfortable, he can't sit.<br/>artificial day skeleton keeps him up all night    </i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267462/#Comment_267462" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-16T10:21:17+00:00" title="April 16, 2010 10:21AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite>At the risk of this blowing up in all of our faces, I don't want it to pass unremarked that the first two posts here had to be pure working-out-of-racial-anxiety before we could talk about what was being said.<br/><br/>This isn't a personal thing against walkerp and Adam - racial anxieties are real after all, and we're all subject to them at one time or another - and it's not casting blame anywhere at all.

We Want Story Now! (Repeat 3x)</blockquote>\nThis line is the fucking shit.<br/><br/>Also, thank you everyone in this thread, for giving me a good primer in this (non)category of hip-hop. I've been wanting one for a long time!<br/><br/>Now, about the topic-as-related-to-gaming:<br/><br/>The whole "what category do you belong to?" question is close to my heart. When I discovered Indie gaming (whatever that means) and particularly the Story Now ethos (whatever that means), I was instantly drawn to it, and perfectly happy to call myself an "indie gamer." But I noticed that this was divisive in internet communities, and I didn't know how to handle that. I certainly DID like the indie games I was discovering, and quite a BIT thankyouverymuch, but I didn't want to be drafted into a war that I didn't even want to exist. But I didn't want to drop the label, because I wanted to discover more games that fit what I was looking for, and find people who I could enjoy them with. What was I to do?<br/><br/>I dabbled in a couple of indie games with some of my long-standing gamer group, but it was when I attended the Portland area's local Gamestorm convention that I started mixing with "gamer culture" at large, and I found that...well, the two "camps" that people were dividing into on the Internets didn't exist. The games I and my new indie friends were playing (and in some cases, writing) were largely just "some games" that fit right into the same category as the games folks had already heard of, like D&amp;D, BESM, or GURPS. Now sure, when people would sit down to play these games, they would bring their own assumptions and practices to the process, and sometimes this wouldn't mesh well with a particular game's process or purpose. But that wasn't any different than, say, playing Over the Edge and approaching it like a dungeon crawl, or even, dare I say, playing In a Wicked Age and approaching it like Dogs in the Vineyard. So there was definite clash of play philosophies--I still remember the Savage Worlds GM who extolled the virtues of Dogs, then proceeded to run his very Dogs-like Solomon Kane scenario in a profoundly un-Dogs-like manner--but it was just a clash within, like, a pool of people in a hobby playing in all kinds of ways, and crossing over the Trad-Indie divide all over the place. Compared to some of the polarized debates on the net, it was refreshing.<br/><br/>But! While I'm all about tearing down the walls between folks and just being all in this together...I really DO have a pretty focused gaming ethos that I'm attracted to. I really WILL be far happier in a hardcore Story Now game than in a "we're just trying to immerse in character and make the world as real as possible" (AKA Right To Dream) game--though I have a feeling Apocalypse World can provide the best of both, and I'm looking forward to playing it more. But I've decided that I'm not going to softball what my gaming passion is, merely in an effort to "get along" in some hazy way with other gamers. Of course the dark side of this passion is that there are some processes or purposes of gaming that I find incredibly dull or even poisonous, which makes getting along hard. But I aim to focus on the positive--what DO I love?--and "get along" with other players by sharing or at least appreciating each other's passion.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel<br/><br/>PS. That came out a little more manifesto-y than I originally intended, but that seems appropriate to the thread. <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
