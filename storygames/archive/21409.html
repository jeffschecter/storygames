                    Hello, gamers. What did you play this week?<br/><br/>The previous threads were great, so let's keep it going. If you want to ask questions about someone's game or go into more detail, spin off a new thread and dig in. That way we'll have even more discussions about games we've played, which would be awesome.<br/><br/>(Here's what we played in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20918/what-did-you-play-this-week-2017/" rel="nofollow">2017</a> and <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20622/what-did-you-play-this-week-2016" rel="nofollow">2016</a>)                </div>

                            I ran more <b>D&amp;D 5e</b> in my <b>Mirrorrim Megadungeon</b> campaign. I had seven players RSVP to play. Turned one away (six max) and then one didn't show up (grumble). I had three "Maybe" RSVPs.<br/><br/>I continue to learn to use the Roll20 features better. I purchased the official Monster Manual Compendium addon and that streamlined my monster setup. Last night's encounter was with seven <i>flying swords</i> (CR 1/4 each), but they were customized monsters: <i>enchanted flying swords</i> (CR 1 each). That mean I had to modify the stats before putting them onto the map, which I did before the game.<br/><br/>I was able to easily use the controls in Roll20 for attacks and damage. Players who use the in-game character sheet respond about 10-20 times faster than players who simply type in "/roll" commands. I am encouraging players to get their stuff onto the sheet.                        </div>

                            Interesting! I have yet to try roll20 myself, but I've watched a few games played on it (including a session of Dogs in the Vineyard!) and it seems to work very well. I'll definitely catch one of your sessions soon - perhaps this week!                        </div>

                            We finished our <b>Apocalypse World</b> mini campaign, things got super dark in this campaign and just got darker; I think we all went a little gonzo at the end to deal it—plus, we were tired. I was a Machiavellian-ish character who used his luxe allure and body to get to the top. But compared to most of the other characters I was a saint. It was a strange experience, by the end I actually felt allied with my character a bit, because I felt used for sex a bit, haha. Usually, I’m more of an actor whose interest is in the narrative’s quality rather than empathizing strongly with my character. I ended up taking the most evil character out, which definitely fit my Machiavellian plan and character, as well as, the narrative, but there was a bit of indignance as well. A very interesting experience.                         </div>

3 sessions over 2 months.<br/><br/>I'll echo what Jeff said, there were some manipulated and dark things. <br/><br/>I was partially to blame. My battlebabe came to the hardhold seeking judgement &amp; carrying a duffle bag that turned out to be full of children's bones. They had tried to eat him in his sleep and he killed them.<br/><br/>The judgement of the hocus was that he had to give a limb to feed the children of the hardhold. Making a roll to keep still enough to allow the cult followers to rip his left arm off...was not a favorite gaming moment for me.<br/><br/>I'm left asking: if you remove gore, sex, and PvP conflict from Apocalypse World, what is left?                        </div>

Mongrel, I didn’t really see it as an AW thing personally. I thought it was more about the players really letting their id out. It was really weird how my character was treated in terms of sex...kind of grossed me out. Anyway, if you and Paul want to discuss it further we can do so in another tread or IM each other.<br/><br/>Paul, I like PbtA games because players have enough impute to make things interesting. They don’t really feel like traditional RPGs to me because of that <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Traditional game’s can feel like a boring slog to me sometimes, but I still like them, and they can be fun. But I like “Story Games” the most, and “Story Game/RPG hybrids;” they seem more interactive and inventive to me, rather that reactive. <br/> </div>

                            (Yeah, but they didn't stay dead!)<br/><br/>I killed someone, too.<br/><br/>Last night we wrapped up our game of <i>A Taste for Murder</i>, which I'll have to post about sometime. I killed Everett, the American bootlegger millionaire. (However, since it was <i>A Taste for Murder</i>, I wasn't the one who made the decision to kill him!)<br/><br/>However, my wannabe-actress femme fatale was led away in handcuffs and boarded a ship to America... maybe she was going to prison, but, dammit, she had achieved her dream at last!<br/><br/>Tonight I will try on <i>In Dreaming Avalon</i> for size with a different crowd.

However, in the end days of 20017 We playtested a game (did it even have a name yet???) with a novel card mechanic. It worked and had potential for further development.  Yeah Kate!

                            No, they stayed dead and one lost some XP. I let them "soft reset" with the same character sheets and new names. Siblings or something.<br/><br/>I ran <b>D&amp;D 5e</b> again last night. Killed everyone repeatedly (but they got better). Deadly encounter, three 4th level PCs and a 1st level PC. Repeated drops, healing, and so on. The 1st level character took 19 damage and an insta-death ruling.<br/><br/>Really, they need to try some new tactics. They totally fell for an ambush, got surrounded, failed to flee when things got tough, etc. Also, not having any kind of battlefield control (a wizard) hurts.

If you’d like, I’d be happy to give you some feedback and let you know what the group has expressed, if you want to text or IM me. Or, we could schedule about 30 minuets to talk about it right before our final session? There’s no reason we can’t make some adjustments. <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> <br/><br/> </div>

Yup. I went with <a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a> 's fish tank, but 10-12 people/factions had ballooned up to 16-18 by session 5. <br/><br/>Running it as a dynamic sandbox meant that I only minimally nudged discoveries, and because of the sheer bulk of info my hints maybe needed to be "blunts" instead.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">@Jeff_Slater</a> My thought is that I'll try to let everyone get to whatever info/accomplishment stopping point seems good for finale/session 8 and call it good (or at least done).<br/><br/>Vegas 2233 will only come back by demand, which I'm not anticipating.                        </div>

                            My reading of Rickard's "fish tank" strategy is that the GM's job is to throw the information at the players, full stop, not hint at it. <br/><br/>Here are his own words on the subject, and I think he's exactly right:
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Rickard's_Article" rel="nofollow">Rickard's_Article</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><b>Give Out All The Information</b><br/><br/>Don’t be afraid of letting the players know too much. Every time they interact with someone, give out a relationship as a reward and for every new scene, try to give them at least one new relation. <br/><br/>If the players get stuck in the adventure, repeat the factions and their relations, either in-game by reporting to someone or by just discussing it with your players. You could also create new scenes where you give them more clues (read: reveal more relations). <b>Discover the fun part of giving too much information to the players</b>.</p></div></blockquote>
I think a lot of GMs internalize this idea that it's their job to "make things mysterious" and to hold information back from the players.<br/><br/>That pretty much never goes anywhere good, in my experience. <br/><br/>(Just learning gradually about 16-18 factions/NPCs is plenty enough "mystery"! It's all new to the players, so piecing it together is both challenging and exciting.)                        </div>

Much appreciated, Jeff<br/><br/>I played great one-shots of <b>No Boundaries</b> and <b>Union</b>, and we returned to our <b>Uncharted World</b> "A-Team in Space" game. We've started digging a lot more into exactly how our deserting Legion veterans feel about their past deeds and the human cost of any real rebellion. Action A-Team has turned quite serious.                        </div>

<i>In Dreaming Avalon</i>, one of Vincent's playtest drafts of GMless mini-game collections, earlier this week.<br/><br/>The game was quite intense, as I was playing with some serious LARPers who got quite heavily into character. I'm not at all familiar with the whole "faerie" genre, so I played an outsider - a knight, a woman disguised as a man who fought to become Captain of the Guard.<br/><br/>I was asked to fight a fellow knight and I let her win, to please the Faerie Queen.<br/><br/>Morgan le Fay, who sat over the Faerie Court, chose me to take her throne temporarily. Making faerie-like pronouncements to a group of whispering people is a pretty interesting procedure!<br/><br/>Finally, I realized that it was my presence which allowed the Ogre into the Faerie Kingdom, and everyone had to hunt him down - it turned out the Ogre was sitting on the throne at Camelot, posing as the aging King Arthur.<br/><br/>The game was very effective, even though I'm less sure of its replay value than the other ones (like <i>The King is Dead</i>).                        </div>

                            Yesterday was the second indie RPG day at my FLGS. I hoped to continue my <b>Masks: A New Generation</b> session from last time, but two of the players (sadly, the ones who had the most intriguing characters) dropped out without any further communication. I recruited two replacement players, and gave the players of the other two characters the option to continue with their existing characters or make new ones; they decided to explore new playbooks and make new characters.<br/><br/>Not wanting to scrap a heap of work I did to build on the prior session, I kept several setting elements intact for this session.<br/><br/>The group ended up playing:<br/><b>Yayael </b>(the Transformed)<br/><b>Experiment 113</b>, AKA "Ex113" AKA "Excel" (the Brute)<br/><b>Evan Horizon</b> (the Nova)<br/><b>Flashing</b> (the Janus)<br/><br/>Those who know Masks' playbooks know that 3 of those are the most destructive playbooks. I see the team as a sort of wrecking crew who will draw harsh criticism for their excessive collateral damage, but who will be called on to save the day.<br/><br/>Inspired by nothing so much as convenient timing of a Harry Potter ad I saw while preparing the game, I set up the Rook Academy, a academy for young supers that is secretly run by a corporation with ulterior motives. The first (reboot) session saw the PCs invited to an "informative session" and tour of the rook academy, when the academy gets attacked by robots meaning to abduct the new students for sinister experiments.<br/><br/>The new players seemed interested in continuing the game outside of the venue of the store's monthly gameday, and one of the players offered up the possibility of running some events at the monthly gameday.                        </div>

We're getting close to finishing up with the second story arc, which is exciting. And then tonight I ran a prologue session of <b>Blades in the Dark</b>. It was my first time running it and our first time playing it in general, and it was super exciting. They stole a train and everything became a huge chaotic mess and it was great.                        </div>

They took my pregenerated characters Jack d'Illaque (a Naive knight with a little sow) and Glipillidi (a frogmen adept of poisons). It was a blast, with a jungle trip, some flashback memories, a swarm of insects, and the resurrection of Arihman, a forgotten demon.                         </div>

We were *this* close to saving the park. We'd all been united and inspired by the rising intern, Bethany McCully (now the future Mrs. Chaz Winderbilt), and we were ready to eat the cost and restart the program and grow natural dinosaurs instead of the programmed-to-passivity monstrosities we'd been peddling.<br/><br/>But we forgot the cardinal rule: natural dinosaurs are bitey. Too bitey. Cue Crisis.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.lamemage.com/kingdom/games/kingdom-dinosaurs1-800.jpg"/><br/><br/>I'm behind so this is more "what did I play in the last ten days" than the last week:<br/><br/><b>Mind of Margaret</b> at Story Games Seattle. Lance Riviera was determined to step out of his rival's shadow and become the star of the cruise ship show, but Pride sabotaged him at every turn. Mind of Margaret continues to be a big winner in my book.<br/><br/>And then a great intro game of <b>Polaris</b>, also at Story Games Seattle. Everybody really embraced learning the Polaris-style of play.                        </div>

                            Got to play <b>Follow</b> twice last week. <br/><br/>Once via Hangouts with a group I used to play D&amp;D with in person. We played the Colony scenario: we were a team sent by some investors to drill and mine natural resources out of "Planet 7". I was worried that they would not like the game as it is a complete departure from what we had played before but it worked really well. The power gamer did manage to get his want out of my character sometime in the 3rd Act, so he was happy that he had "won".<br/><br/><br/>Played at our weekly meetup with a large group. We were seven, playing with two new players. We played the Rebellion scenario as a group of outcasts in a medieval world, trying to summon Cthulhu to bring them to power. The game went very well, even with the high player count. <br/><br/> </div>

                            Played a nice one-shot of <i>Dust, Fog, and Glowing Embers</i>. I liked a lot of the details of the setting and the colour of the whole thing. The mechanics worked well, but were a little vague in places, so they didn't completely win me over.                         </div>

                            Got to play another <b>Sorcerer</b> session yesterday. All the vids are posted at Ron Edwards' new website, in case someone's interested. Most of the session was to fine-tune what we wanted out of the game, since one of the players was feeling some dissonance with how he envisioned his character and the actual gameplay. Nevertheless, we got to play for about half an hour and it was pretty OK, but too short for awesome.                        </div>

                            Completed episode 11 in our long-running, 2-player <i>Leviathan Manifesto</i> game: it was a success of sorts, or at least nobody died (yet).<br/>Started episode 12, which perhaps deviates a bit more from RAW in that we are only nominally starting with an identity, but actually from tying up some of the loose ends of an old failed case (episode 2!).<br/><br/>Played <i>Sorcerer</i> on Sunday afternoon, as usual (our SF <i>"Mother-ships"</i> game).                        </div>

                            Oh man. I only survived because I miraculously rolled a natural 20 on my final chance at a death check. I dig it.<br/><br/>I'm not a huge fan of 5E for this kind of play, but Adam is running this thing EXACTLY RIGHT, which means everything in this type of game.<br/><br/>I love the balance of danger/ instant adventure ("ok, you're at the entrance ti the dungeon! What do you do?") and the occasional engagement with a deep setting and the personal concerns of the characters.<br/><br/>It's also exciting to see someone ACTUALLY DOING a successful megadungeon campaign with a giant character stable. That's no mean accomplishment!<br/><br/> </div>

                            We had a super fun game of <b>Dungeon World</b>. I absolutely love PbtA games. The GM who has been running many of the games  at Story Games SLC lately is absolutely excellent. Best I’ve ever played with. He’s a member of these forums, so you should play with him online if you get the chance (hi Zack <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/>). Anyway, he actually had me legitimately tongue-tied and scared of a Duchess who had me in a spot; I was so immersed in the reality of his characters that I actually felt a sense of anxiousness and need for self-preservation and felt like I was actually there at moments, trying to stammer out an excuse to save my life. We honestly don’t deserve him, ha ha <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> <br/><br/> </div>

Oh, I’m not against GMed games, just traditionally GMed games that don’t have much room for the players to contribute creatively. Even traditionally bifurcated RPG‘s can be fun but only if the GM is a good story teller and cares about the players’ stake in the game. So it’s more of the traditional style GMed games that I’m not into, not GMed games per se.  Anyway, if you want to talk more about it we can make a new thread <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> <br/><br/>I just realized you’re probably talking about Story Games Salt Lake City’s  past emphasis on GMless games, so I think I get what you’re saying. I like that we’re playing a larger variety of indie  games now <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> </div>

                            I had some friends over to play <b>Tall Pines </b>last night! It was as Twin Peaks-y as can be, with some excellently long camera shots, awkward dialogue, and small town drama/occult surrealism. We especially loved using the symbol cards to introduce reoccurring imagery.                        </div>

                            We have been playing a <b>World of Dew </b>campaign. It’s been nice so far; I’m a cunning  Geisha using my adept mind to find corruption in high places and destroy it and those behind it. The system is a bit cumbersome for my tastes but it’s doing the job. Nice to play a different type of game with different cultural mores.<br/><br/>We are also starting up a <b>Sorcerer</b> campaign that looks to be fun. I’m playing a scientific genius who is a megalomaniac trying to engineer paradise on earth… what could go wrong?                        </div>

                            Finally got around to playing Ghost Court this weekend.  We had a few hours of court, and maybe ten to fifteen cases.  We didn't have a big group, so we let the cases breathe a little.  At one point, everyone in the room was active and involved with a case: the two people, plus their divorce lawyers were called up by the judge, and then the hauntweiler dog, which was the focus of the case.<br/><br/>Since the game is nominally a TV show, we started inserting commercials between cases, and got to know our little ghost-ridden town pretty well.<br/><br/>And it proved very new RP-er friendly, to boot!  Delightful time!                        </div>

                            I started an online Trail of Cthulhu game where the player characters are all young ambitious G-men.  The Depression-era Midwest makes a pretty good dystopian setting. <br/><br/>EDIT: I forgot to say what makes this interesting! I decided on the system and setting because I think my GM skills are getting sloppy, and I tend to lean too much on what I imagine to be my strengths (characterization and colorful description).  So I wanted to try running a system with pretty clear-cut rules and lots of premade adventures that I can adapt so I can focus on a limited set of GM'ing goals, making the story hum along in a taut manner and keeping everyone engaged.                         </div>

                            Alongside our familiar friends <a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> and <a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">@Jeff_Slater</a>, we started a short-run game of <i>Sorcerer</i> last night.<br/><br/>We're struggling a little with the text (working with the <i>Annotated Sorcerer</i>), and the Demon creation process feels odd and unnecessary to me. However, it's cool to see how strong the premise of the game is, how it leads naturally into the kind of Narrativist play Ron was always talking about, and how all three players jumped in full-bore when it comes to our character concepts.<br/><br/>Each is involved in a really dark and hard-hitting drama, dealing with isolation, horror, and dysfunctional family dynamics. There are really interesting contrasts and parallels between all the characters. I'm looking forward to seeing where it goes.                        </div>

                            Starting up a proper campaign of Apocalypse World. Exciting for me, because it's been a long time since I felt like I had a group of committed gamers interested in a long-term game. Haven't done that in a while!<br/><br/>I'm playtesting some alternate dice rules (dice pools instead of 2d6+adds) as well as some other things.                        </div>

                            Playtested a gm’d game called “shoot em’up”. We pushed it in a gonzo goofy direction. Worked, but not the way it was designed I don’t think.   Interesting dual challenge mechanism in which group has collective pool of success, but so does gm.  Characters also have individual hit point like mechanic. <br/><br/>Also playtested “watch out!  Magical girl attack...”. Simple game w really well matched (to the theme) mechanic for characters to affect each others emotional state.   <br/> </div>

We teens summoned a demon for its power, then lost control of it and spent the game chasing it.<br/><br/><b>Misspent Youth</b> (run by me). The YOs took on the GOOP Corporation and created a bio virus that ate Goop and nanowove it into plants and trees and stuff.<br/><br/><b>FATE Accelerated</b> with modifications, run by Russell Collins and set in the <a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/185979/Evolution-Pulse--English-Edition" rel="nofollow">Evolution Pulse</a> manga universe. <br/><br/><b>7th Sea LARP</b>, run by the Weird Sisters Games group. I played a Montaigne doctor/nobleman and I helped depose a tyrant king. Joe Zantec and I saw people playing the enormous Battlestar Galactica LARP last year and thought it was way outside our comfort zone, so of course, we should try something like that. We made a pact last year and Joe reminded me at registration this year, so we signed up for 7th Sea (as 2017 was BSG's last year).<br/><br/><b>Misspent Youth, India's Daughters</b> (run by me), the <i>Sell Out with Me</i> world-scenario written by Ajit George and Strix Beltran. I had four amazing players who treated the difficult material with class and love. I cried twice before we even started playing. <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21495/misspent-youth-indias-daughters" rel="nofollow">I posted more in another thread.</a><br/><br/><b>Mongoose Traveller</b> 2nd ed., the <i>High and Dry</i> scenario, run "off the books" of the convention, for Eric Tage Larsen, Bill White, Buddha, and Andrea Tapia.<br/><br/>Also spent 90 minutes with Nathan Paoletta, talking to Bill White about The Forge and our experiences there before, during, and after.

                            Dreamation so:<br/><br/><b>Those Who Remain</b>, by Sam Zeitlin, in which I got to be The Devil. Not the actual Prince of Lies but close enough. I loved the archetypal setup in this game, and also being typecast.<br/><br/><b>WINTERHORN</b>, which I set up for an acrimonious 8-person Working Group who did their jobs extremely well. Hooray? Good job team on destroying these earnest, harmless activists?<br/><b><br/>The Climb</b>, which was a pleasant surprise! They were down a player and, hey, I'm a player! I played Dorsey, the only role I have ever played in my game.<br/><br/><b>Wight Wedding</b>, by Jacqueline Bryk, where I played the ghost groom marrying my very much alive maybe sweetheart? It's complicated.<br/><br/><b>Stowaways</b>, by Sadia Bies and Ben Books Schwartz and Maya Ziv, in which I got cast as an ex-military bodyguard with some heavy baggage and also he was a psychic in his brain. The brilliant thing about this game was that it provided a diegetic reason for all 20 players to be extremely quiet for hours and hours.<br/><br/><b>Guest Suite</b>, by Banana Chan and me, which was a progressive improvement over the first playtest and a very silly game about being a VIP at a fandom convention. Very meta.<br/><br/><b>Night Witches</b>, with 4 brave GMs and 16 players, which was chaotic and tragic and generally Very Good. A wide con event - four tables, four hours, one linked story!<br/><br/><b>Deranged</b>, by Maria &amp; Jeppe Bergmann Hamming and facilitated by James Stuart. It is basically a larp about the life of Clara Weick through the lens of her dying husband Robert Schumann's unreliable memories. it is the best game I've played in ages. <br/><br/><b>No Further Questions</b>, by Jeff Dieterle and Chad Wolf who, along with Kitty Stoholski, appear to be trying to make "New Jersey weird game design crew" a thing - anyway this game is hilarious and great.<br/><br/><b>If I Were President - 22XX Hyper Edition</b> by James Stuart, an overlooked gem that is both ridiculous and, having been written about politics in 2014, adorable.                         </div>

                            I played <i>Tales of Entropy</i> online today with Ron Edwards, Petteri Hannila (the designer) and a cheerful, lovely fellow named Santiago. First of all, love the mix of cultures and backgrounds - fantastic.<br/><br/>Tales of Entropy is a very cool game, too. I initially wasn't too interested, given that it doesn't seem to have any particularly "cool" or innovative technology, and a bunch of things I often don't like in games (e.g. freeform Traits, voting). However, it's an extremely sharp, well-tuned design, and a pleasure to play. Every bit of the system ties nicely into us learning something about the story we're creating together, and the freeform traits (which tend to be problematic in such designs) are nicely self-correcting in a way I didn't anticipate just from reading the rules. We all decided to continue the game later, since we enjoyed ourselves a good deal so far.<br/><br/>Ron made a diagram of the system in action which was really fantastic - simple and to the point, but helped us all understand how to use the various moving parts to maximum effect.<br/><br/>(I'll tag <a href="/forums/profile/PetteriHannila">@PetteriHannila</a> and <a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> here.)                        </div>

                            Dreamation:<br/><br/><b>The Art of Power. </b> Long Con 3-session attempt to navigate the landscape of power and climb up the ladder.  My wannabe-Littlefinger largely got her ass handed to her, but most of my allies prospered.  Very interesting and intricate system about promises, threats, and the costs of pushing.  The rules-first aspects mean it'll be slow for me to master.<br/><br/><b>Mars 244: Liberation of Sisyphus.</b>  Most of us Martian refugees were quite sympathetic.  I played the blundering asshole.  I eventually attempted to take all the blame but it didn't work.  I thought a robot was going to raise my kid after I was killed, but in reality my brother did.  Crap.<br/><br/><b>Autumn of the Ancients.</b>  We began escorting a galactically important alien across the cosmos.  "We" were a billion-year-old formless reflection, two sentient fungi, and a colony of metal worms cheerfully bent on conquest.  The alien looked like a 7-year-old bald kid.  I played the worm colony.<br/><br/><b>Outrageous Youth.</b>  The Jem and the Holograms hack of Misspent Youth.  Our band Stone Soup tried to bring joy and authenticity to a music scene dominated first by rival Aesthetics of Power and then by the Overmind from the future.  I played a drug-addled bass sax player.<br/><br/>I also ran two of my own unpublished games:<br/><br/><b>Delve.</b>  The players came up with a clever plan to etch the runes from the comatose shaman's scroll onto the demon container before the demon could poison the minds of everyone in town.  They saved the town... but freed the demon.<br/><br/><b>Within My Clutches.</b>  Our cast of supervillains endured an epic roller coaster of ups and downs.  Gravitas won her space base, and Icon finally got some peace and quiet away from fans, but Bombshell crashed and lost her marriage to the police chief and the respect of her obnoxious sidekick.  Scheming Doctor Elemental turned a prison into adamantium to eliminate rivals and turn foes into allies, while demonic rocker Emmy Venom got stuck doing ads for lite radio.                        </div>

                            At <b>DREAMATION</b>:<br/><br/><b>Psi Run</b>, run by Richard Ruane.  Not sure why i thought i was reluctantly getting into a Shadowrun game.  I mean, i guess, "run" but that's thin.  It was a pleasant surprise and a nice introduction to a few people at the table as well as nice light game.  First time I've played in a game with repeated time shifts where the table has replayed scenes over and over again.<br/><br/><b>[Autumn of the Ancients]</b> (thanks for the correction, Cat) with Jennifer Martin. Incredible table of players.  One of the best games I played at the con.  Not sure about replay... time will tell.<br/><br/><b>Everyone's a Suspect</b> run by Kristin. Interesting to watch these murder/mystery games evolve, this being a marriage of elements of Fiasco to Homicide SVU and Walmsley's murder game.  Enjoyable but a tad fiddly. <br/><br/><b>Doom Troopers</b>. An enjoyable alpha-test romp through a broken attempt to marry minis table wargame to rpg.  wish him well with this but not an rpg atm.<br/><br/><b>Overslept</b>.  I'm pretty sure I did this to myself.  We'll call this solo play. No, not like that.<br/><br/><b>Red Carnations on a Black Grave</b>, run by Cat Ramen.  Cat, I adore you.  This is a crazy game.  Newer historical setting slathered on to Montsegur backbone.<br/><br/><b>Everyone's a Suspect</b>, again.  This time with Shawn (...?).  Shawn got shanghai'ed into the game after a player dropped out and the other two players at the table were sort of phoning it in leaving the heavy lifting to the two of us.  We had a great time but the game itself was super rocky.<br/><br/><b>Mongoose Traveller 2nd ed.</b>, Dray ran a bunch of us including, Bill White, Buddha, and Andrea Tapia through some Trav as an off-the-books farewell to the con.<br/><br/> </div>

                            Last Saturday was the annual convention of my association, "Le Colloque de Bob le Rôliste" (french convention in Nantes).<br/><br/>I managed to playtest my game "<b>Les Enfants du V.A.G.I.N.</b>" (Swords Without Master hack, Diesel-punk X-Men meets Les Misérables universe), and it was great ! Some things to control / add / enhance, but for a first test, it was a great session.<br/><br/>Then, the theme of the convention being "Dreams &amp; Nightmares", I put on the table a <b>Swords Without Master</b> session, with five players, in the Carnival of Dreams. The story went far from what I prepared, but it was great. Priests with birds-mark, twisted unicorns, ritual sacrifice and the dream of each character available before them in the end, with a twist and some deaths. Or not ? Was it a dream ?<br/><br/>Two sessions of three hours (thanks SWM and the Motifs for that !), a broken voice, some cuts on my hands because I'm not able to cut myself a slice of bread, it was a great con !                        </div>

                            We played Swords Without Master for the first time.  Though the book was hard to wrap my brain around, things clicked into place quickly once we started playing, and I adored how Motifs and Mysteries create a Chekov's gun situation within the story.<br/><br/>It was everyone's first time, and it seemed like we each focused in on a different one of the game mechanics, so we all played it a little differently.  I'm excited to try it again to try to learn how to make the system really work for me.<br/><br/>And I am very excited for Breakout Con next weekend in Toronto!                        </div>

                            Recently I've had the good fortune to be able to play in an ongoing game of <i>Simple Superheroes</i> (the game I designed). Which is pretty rare. 2 weeks ago was the sixth or so session that I've participated in (and there have been sessions without me as well).<br/>We brought on some new players, and had a "tryouts" for the newly forming <i>Exemplars</i>. <br/>Of course some of the bad guys heard about our tryouts, sent in a decoy and sprung an ambush. I got to say something I've been wanting to the since I created my duplicating superhero Maniple: "I punch the whole room."<br/>It got a good laugh, and then I proceeded to do it (it wasn't terribly effective but so awesome at the same time.) <br/><br/>Oh, and I am very much looking forward to Breakout Con. I've been to every one so far, and they've always been great.                        </div>

<div class="Message">
                            On Sunday we played the 16th session of my Spicy Dice Roll game.<br/><br/>The session prior, Peter's urchin-cum-galley slave Ado had (as was his custom) picked the lock on his manacles to steal food from the captain's quarters, and, when a pirate accidentally stumbled upon him, ended up diving overboard. Ado can't swim! Yonatan had his captain-king Varpunen-pala break off a duel to dive into the ocean and fish him out. He rolled two 20s in a row! At the time, I didn't really know what to do with it.<br/><br/>Varpunen-pala is <i>fated</i>, favored by his wind-god, having learned the art of reckoning by star and wind and current while adrift at sea on a shattered spar of wood. He's returning home to reclaim his pirate isle from the man who threw him overboard. Between sessions, I decided that this double-20, combined with the homecoming, and his heroism, all at the margin of land and sea, meant he'd pulled his wind-god's attention, who dispatched a messenger.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game I told Austin that his grizzled navigator, Merituuli Far-Chaser, tasted upon the wind, as he sometimes does, something approaching from beyond the southern horizon, something wrathful. Greg's witch Koivu, fearing this portent and unable to divine anything more from the casting of her lots, intends to bind a wind-spirit to her. She takes Varpunen-pala to guide her, goes to a high cliff overlooking the sea, and there draws a magic circle intended to pull a wind-spirit into the material world, trap it, and cause it pain until it submits to her will.<br/><br/>At this point Greg only knows that <i>something is coming</i>, nobody has any inkling that it's a wind-spirit of exactly the sort that Koivu intends to call and bind, seeking the very man she's taken with her to guard her while she draws her circle. So I ask Greg for a roll and he rolls well, and I tell him a spirit has come to him even before he calls out, a wrathful spirit of storm. Koivu immediately brings her full will to bear, spending from her permanent magical reservoir to grapple with this spirit of great potency, draw it into the material world, and trap it in her circle.<br/><br/>Where it immediately turns to address Varpunen-pala. I spend the next ten or fifteen minutes declaiming and conversing as the spirit, in improvised trochaic verse, giving dire warnings, demanding to be set free. "When you dove into the water, / Pulled the gaze of Tulyashoya, / From the Utter-South she sent me / Like a bolt shot from her cross-bow!" In the end both Varpunen and Koivu are courteous to the spirit, and Koivu sets it free, whereupon it retreats to the edge of the horizon and seethes, an encroaching storm.<br/><br/>During the climax of the session, after an eruption of violence under the gilded timbers of the hall of the captain-king, Varpunen's usurper and his remaining supporters are fleeing to their longboat to escape. Merituuli has taken a gamble, guiding a ship without a pilot in treacherous shallow shoals, and grounded the PCs' ship on a hidden sandbar under the waves. The wicked Aati-pala is getting away! Greg has Koivu reach out to the storm-spirit; she bids it come and spend its rage however it wills. This is in its nature, Koivu's expenditure of permanent reservoir has established a sort of bond between them, and Greg rolls well, so the spirit comes! It carries away the sails and smashes the oars of Aati-pala's ship, forcing him to seek refuge with a nearby ally rather than escaping to parts unknown.                        </div>

                            No roleplay sessions this week but we did walk through character creation and lifepath in the newest version of Traveller.<br/><br/>I’m not sure that it was a terribly satisfying experience. It was a bit old school, a bit luck heavy for my tastes. Nich—our GM—is quite good though. I’m confident that he will make it fun.<br/><br/>A group of us is getting together Friday for some serious story play however—Fiacso and possibly a Lasers &amp; Feelings game. :-)                        </div>

                            It was an enjoyable evening, the 2nd evening of this adventure.<br/><br/>The characters wanted to ask the night watchman of the british library about the theft of the book, but as they arrived in his small room, they found him dead in his bed, throat slit, his fist contained a folded velvet button of a classy suit. After some investigation they found the tailor, that made the button. The man didn´t tell anything about his customers. With the aid of a guttersnipe the scientists found out about a day the tailor would be in the country, broke in his shop and found his accounting book. One of his last customers was John Pizer, the jewish shoemaker, that was suspect of the whitechapel murders ("leather apron"). The scientists knew that scotland yard hadn´t enough evidence and currently Pizer is on the loose. They visited Pizer in his dingy workshop and realized that he isn´t wealthy enough to buy expensive suits. Now they know, that someone poses as Pizer to set him up for the whitechapel murders.<br/><br/>Maybe next evening they´ll find the culprit.                        </div>

                            Also Aviatrix’s <b>Rovers</b>, although a different adventure!  The crew of the Empress’ Gift infiltrate a mothballed railgun orbital launcher to salvage its positronic brain to sell to wildcat miners who’ve built their own secret launcher and just need a CPU to plan the launches.  We damage our runabout trying to land covertly, trigger drone tanks defending the site, and walk into a zone contaminated with radiation in order to reach the brain core.  Escaping the area, things get worse when the positronic brain starts playing mind games.  We sold it to the wildcatter boss, but I’m thinking now that is exactly where the brain wanted to be.  Does for <i>Classic Traveller </i>what<i> World of Dungeons</i> did for <i>Dungeon World</i>, if that makes sense!                        </div>

                            We just tried Nick Wedig's <i><a href="http://nickwedig.libraryofhighmoon.com/2011/03/fortune-cookies-and-nuclear-war/" rel="nofollow">Fortune Cookies and Nuclear War</a></i>.  over lunch at Slim Chicken's.  Since Slim Chicken's doesn't include fortune cookies with our meal, we each downloaded fortunes from the <a href="https://www.astrology.com/game/fortune-cookie.html" rel="nofollow">Random Fortune Cookie generator</a> at Astrology.com<br/><br/>Owing to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/09/world/asia/north-korea-us-talks-timeline-trump-kim-history.html" rel="nofollow">current headlines</a>, Jarrod and I opted to hold our negotiations between the United States and North Korea.  A coin flip cast Jarrod as Korea and yours truly as the good old US of A.<br/><br/>This (largely) freeform game was lots of fun.  <br/><br/>The US agreed to walk back trade sanctions in exchange for allowing foreign nationals and corporations to invest in North Korean businesses and infrastructure.  <br/><br/>North Korea was allowed to continue developing its nuclear infrastructure and in exchange agreed to stop developing intercontinental weapons technology.<br/><br/>North Korea agreed to send some of its students to university in South Korea provided that an equal number of South Korean students attended North Korean schools.<br/><br/>The US did not embrace North Korea's insistence that it recognize the Kim dynasty as eternal.<br/><br/>North Korea refused to allow United Nations representatives to oversee its elections.<br/><br/>In the final analysis, we decided that the US was the "winner" of these negotiations but that more importantly, we had prevented any escalation of hostilities.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys freeform play.                        </div>

Really?

                            A little illness knocked most of my gaming offline for a while, but I am coming back around.<br/><br/>I host a monthly Indie gameday at the FLGS. This time I ran one of the free scenarios for <b>City of Mist</b>. It's an interesting little hybrid, PbtA engine but with oddly Fate/aspect adjacent stats. I used the beautifully illustrated characters from the starter kit, but I am really intrigued in turning the players loose on the core book's character generation and see what they come up with.<br/><br/>Thursday was the first time I ran my "weekly" <b>Starfinder</b> game in a month. I am running the adventure path. I am an old time SF GM and I have to say that the adventure path feels a little too bog standard fantasy. I had to mix things up a bit to deliver the sort of SF feel the players were looking for.<br/><br/>Friday I ran <b>Bulldogs</b> (fate core edition). It's an okay game that does a decent job of avoiding that "samey" feel I get when playing fate sometimes.<br/><br/>Saturday was my monthly <b>Pathfinder</b> game. I ran a bit short on time and innovation and so decided to splice the adventure "The Impossible Eye" into my campaign. This session was mostly traditional dungeon crawl. But I threw a rival party in the adventure with them, and the big bad of the adventure is playing them off the PCs. Next time the rival will try to make a (disingenuous) bargain with the PCs, which should complicate the situation nicely.                        </div>

                            I playtested <b>Godjobs</b> and <b>Safety in Numbers</b> yesterday morning at Concrete Cow in Milton Keynes; both were good sessions, with my major takeaway being that the former needs more tips &amp; techniques to smooth out play, while the latter needs some incentive for players to create peril beyond the "You're in a disaster movie" assumption.<br/><br/>In the afternoon, I played in <b>Remember Tomorrow</b>, a game I really like but haven't played in years, so I was a bit rusty on the systems but we wove a good cohesive story out of it. It felt like we focused more on ticking goals than I have in past sessions, which was really good as we got three satisfactory Exits that made a fitting end point to the episode.                        </div>

                            I'm cheating and reporting about the last two weeks or so...<br/><br/>We're still playing 2-player <i>Leviathan Manifesto</i>, currently the 12th case in our ongoing "series". On Friday night we got <i>close</i> to a resolution, plus we had a "personal scene" which I believe would make it satisfactory enough if this were the final episode! But there are 2 Kings on the table already, so a bit of bad luck can make it end in disaster anytime now.<br/><br/>We played a game of <i>Follow</i> with a new friend (3 players total) over the last two Wednesday nights. We chose the Breakthrough quest and made it into a tale of garage fringe-science: a team of bitter researcher cast out of university and sexy charismatic pseudo-scientist, worthy of a Ghostbusters movie, funded by a gangster-y Hollywood music producer dying of old age and operating out of a rich mom's spare garden house, experimenting on animals to assemble a Dream-o-scope machine which never actually worked on humans. Like 90% of my <i>Follow</i> games, it ended in tragedy - but at least it was <i>funny</i> tragedy, comparable to the very best <i>Fiasco</i>s.<br/><br/>Last weekend I attended a local, weekend-long RPG convention, where I ran/facilitated:
<ul>
<li><i>Settembre poi ci troverà</i> ("September will come and get us"), a quasi-Jeepform, chamber larp scenario I co-wrote with Barbara. It's about summertime flirts, being 18 and looking back when you're 40. This was our second time running it, ever, and we were <i>extremely</i> satisfied with it.</li>
<li><i>Everway: Spherewalkers Unbound</i>, my <i>Archipelago</i>-based hack of the classic 1990s fantasy game. My second time trying to have it fit in a regular 5-hour convention slot, using pre-gen characters. It felt hurried up, more like a demo than the full game, so I'm probably not going to try that again - or at least, definitely not with as many as 5 players.</li>
<li><i>Toward One</i> (Vincent Baker, 2003). We had a lot of fun playing this. I'm happy I dug it up and will definitely play again.</li>
<li>Orion Canning's <i>Abnormal Things</i>, set in an old-fashioned, scenic and <i>definitely not friendly</i> mountain village in Garfagnana (the portion of the Italian Apennines between Lucca and Parma). A ghost story involving clingy, tentacle-like mist abducting people to a remote mountain cave and killing them to avenge an ancient wrong. It was good - some great character moments - but not a perfect whole in terms of pacing (the environment and time constraints were distracting); I think I'm going to play this game again looking for best practices.</li>

When we adopt an obscure game, around here, we <i>really</i> adopt it. :P<br/><br/>And I do want to visit the UK again as a role-player as soon as I'm able to, so what you suggest might be feasible (is there still an IndieCon UK?).<br/>Meanwhile, I'll try and write some more about the experience, eventually. Including how I believed we (involuntarily, but quite severely) deviated from your game-design as intended.                        </div>

                            Another session in our (almost) weekly game of far-future <i>Sorcerer</i>, "The Mother-ships".<br/>PC sorcerer and ghost-in-the-machine Dr. Sander Cross finally managed, with quite a lot of help from other people, to create and activate a duplicate of his own body by downloading his own consciousness to it - but it's a full, autonomous duplicate! Thus, there are 2 of him now, one existing inside the mainframe of an alien spaceship (the PC) and one a vat-grown clone with digitally synced consciousness and memories (technically a passer-type demon).<br/>I also had a chance to drive home the point that, when the survival of a planet of 3,000,000,000 depends entirely on a single piece of ancient and poorly understood tech (otherwise described as a huge, power=20 object-type demon), keeping it technically well-fed isn't necessarily always enough to keep it happy and make it behave. A few random deaths in the news went a lot of way to getting instant attention.<br/>It hurts a bit to know we're gonna have to skip next week's session.                        </div>

                            A busy week of gaming for me, since I spent three days at "Breakout" (a gaming convention in Toronto). (I'm very sad to have missed the signups for <a href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">@Aviatrix</a> 's "Red Carnations", but the way! That was one of my top picks at the convention.)<br/><br/>First, session two of <b><i>Tales of Entropy</i></b>, which continues to move slowly but in very interesting directions. ( <a href="/forums/profile/PetteriHannila">@PetteriHannila</a> and <a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> may appreciate this note!) <br/><br/>It's a lovely design, with lots of interesting little moving bits and pieces that work together in non-obvious ways. My character is an Inquisitor in a fantasy world that's growing out of magic and into a more modern, industrial kind of state. I hunt down people and things that are magical and esoteric and confiscate them. However, I am, of course, fascinated, even obsessed, with these things myself.<br/><br/>One day a man shows up in the City. He is, in fact, not a man at all, but a 90-ft Dragon in the guise of man with flowing golden hair. The Dragon has lain dormant beneath the city for hundreds of years and something has just awoken him.<br/><br/>I have him arrested, of course, but it doesn't take long for him to seduce me with his knowledge of ancient magic. I am entirely in his thrall now.<br/><br/>(However, the conflict was interesting: I somewhat intentionally lost, but, by forcing him to spend resources and accumulate Burdens, turned this moment from a victory for him into a scene where he was revealed as a monster. That turns him from a beloved protagonist into a potential villain, which is a different kind of victory. <i>Tales of Entropy</i> seems to have a lot of potential for this kind of nuanced outcome.)<br/><br/>At the Convention:<br/><br/><i><b>Dream Askew</b></i>, with a lovely bunch of people. It was a very satisfying game with an intense premise and a very interesting conclusion. (Three of five characters died, which is fairly unusual for this game!)<br/><br/>Most interestingly (to me, anyway), a player dropped out and a woman showed up to join us, filling their seat. She had no idea what she had agreed to play, and, it turned out, only had a little experience playing D&amp;D (and no other games). I think she was rather shocked and surprised - a GMless game about a queer apocalypse?!? What?!? - but, of course (as these things usually go), by the end she had totally caught on and made some fantastic contributions.<br/><br/>My character, Lark, was the catalyst for a horrible showdown: arriving as an outsider in the commune, it turned out that my presence endangered everyone, because of the terrifying people who hunted me through a half-remembered past.<br/><br/><b><i>Cartel</i></b>, a game of drug deals and interpersonal drama. I was excited about this game and enjoyed the premise as well as the design. Unfortunately, my playbook choice (as the spouse of a gangster) wasn't well-suited to a scenario which was, ultimately, being assigned a mission by a powerful employer (not much space for a spouse to come along on an assassination mission, so I had to eventually simply ask to be included!). To make things worse, then we were railroaded into an ending where all the PCs were shot in the back (by our own employer, who turned out to be working for the police all along). <br/><br/>I certainly didn't expect that, and I'm sure I wasn't the only player to walk away thinking, "What just happened here?"<br/><br/>My impression is that the GM was excited to pull the rug out from under us with a Shyamalanesque "final twist". That sort of thing can be cool in a movie (and it was relatively well executed here) but not much fun to play through. You can only play so many RPGs were it turns out that your employer only did it to betray you in the end (and you have no say in the outcome) before that turns stale.<br/><br/><b><i>Turning Point</i></b> was a fascinating and beautiful design, run as a playtest by Phil Vecchione. You play out the mental and emotional struggle of a single character confronted with a difficult choice, by reenacting a few key scenes from their life. At the end of the game, the character gives an answer to their dilemma, based on how the scenes played out.<br/><br/>A really intense and personal story in 2 hours flat. Wonderful.<br/><br/>Our character, Adam, was a failed professional skier under pressure by his fiancee to have a baby. In the end, it turned out that his only way of feeling like himself in life was to defy authority and take stupid risks, and that manifested here in his refusal and, most likely, the end of his relationship.<br/><br/>I think the endgame mechanic could be adjusted a little, and hope to chat with the designer about that - otherwise, I think the game is excellent.<br/><br/>Features a somewhat unusual "popcorn" mechanic which is kind of like reverse Fanmail (and serves to weight certain scenes emotionally in the final accounting)<br/><br/><b><i>Swords Without Master</i></b> - I played a very short session with Eppy (the designer) and another good friend. Lots of fun, and a very smart design - I somehow missed out on this game entirely over the years, and have been looking forward to checking it out. (Plus, it was great to catch up with Eppy, whom I haven't seen in a long time!)<br/><br/><b><i>Don't Rest Your Head: Dragon Age</i></b>. I don't know anything about "Dragon Age", but I liked the pitch for the game (at a convention where many games didn't get a blurb at all, the GM of this one posted a really good writeup), and have been very curious about <i>Don't Rest Your Head</i> - another game I missed somehow and have always wanted to play.<br/><br/>I struggled a little, since I knew nothing about the setting and its premise, while every other player was well-versed in it. They did a great job of helping me keep up, though! <br/><br/>The game was highly collaborative, as we played out flashback scenes and narrated bits of backstory about our characters, ending in a dramatic death for all (unlike <i>Cartel</i>, this was well advertised in the game's pitch!).<br/><br/>Most interestingly, this was the only game I participated in which used the "support flower". It's a play aid that has a list of phrases like "I like that! More please" or "Careful!". We never used the negative or cautionary phrases, but the players were really good at pointing to them while they acted out negative or angry reactions. I loved that! It allowed us to dig into inter-character antagonism without worrying about whether someone was angry.<br/><br/><b><i>Heaven's Collapse</i></b>: A GMless game in which we recreate a fictionalized (and slightly fantastic) version of the Rape of Nanking. Facilitated by Wendellyn Reischl, who is the designer.<br/><br/>It was heavy and dramatic, though in a much more contemplative and sorrowful vein than an intense and gut-punchy way. You play out a lot of short, strong scenes (perhaps 20-25?), so even though the game lasted less than 4 hours of play it felt like we had been sitting and immersed in this story for far, far longer. A moving and memorable experience.<br/><br/>The game features a large cast of advisors and key figures who discuss the fate of the city as it falls to the invaders. Why do they treat us like this? What will happen to us? Throughout, the sense of despair mounts as things get worse and worse.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Colin">@Colin</a> was in this game with me, as well as "Turning Point" and "Dragon Age".<br/><br/>(In retrospect, it was really interesting to see how Tales of Entropy, Dream Askew, Turning Point, Swords Without Master, and Heaven's Collapse solve the issues of GMless gaming in very different ways; I'll be pondering this for a while.)<br/><br/>(Cont'd.)                        </div>

<b><i>Krataphagia: the Gore-Filled Sea</i></b>, a playtest of a PbtA game about weird mutant goblin-creatures living in a hostile and terrifying world. Also, they're cannibals. Designed and run by Hamish Cameron.<br/><br/>The setup for the game, the phantasmagoric Colour, and the energy of the players was simply fantastic. Ultimately, I wasn't sure what the point of it was, though - if it was just revelling in describing weird little monsters eating each other, it succeeded 100% (maybe 110%!!!), but that won't hold my attention for any kind of long-term interest.<br/><br/>Very entertaining, though; you get all kinds of interesting benefits by eating things, and if you get too hungry you really get in trouble (you lose control), and it definitely affects you. When I found out one of my legs was "impaired" (I got attacked a by a shark-tailed toothed monster, and it was just hanging, useless), my first impulse was to try to eat the useless thing myself! <br/><br/>Also, we rolled misses (6 or under) for most of the session (and there were a LOT of rolls!), so poor Hamish constantly had to improvise more and more terrible things. A tough spot to be in, as an MC! He did a great job.<br/><br/><b><i>Velvet Glove</i></b> was my final game. Designed and run by Sarah Richardson, who arguably specializes in creating terrifying and intense, fundamentally feminine games. This is a PbtA game where you play young women (high school age) who belong to a gang together. Their lives are shitty because of various forms of systemic oppression, basically, and Sarah really knows how to bring that on. Oh, man.<br/><br/>I'd say it's a little like a more REAL and intense version of Monsterhearts (and without any fantastic elements to distance you from the human drama).<br/><br/>The play here was wonderfully intense and the players <b><i>brought it</i></b>, 100%. <br/><br/>I've heard so many stories about games at conventions that move people, make them want to cry, and feel like they joined the table as strangers but depart as dear friends. That's exactly what this was. I was thinking about it almost non-stop for the next 24 hours. <br/><br/>My character injured or killed (or, at least, severely brain-damaged) a teacher at her school, but, in the end, it was her friend who took the blame. Two of the girls were arrested, and one ended up in prison (because she was 18) - and all for a crime they had nothing to do with! It was all my character's doing. Realizing that my girl could simply walk away from all this and accept society's (and her family's) attempts to force her into a conventional lifestyle and a traditional feminine role, while her friends, who weren't as well off and therefore didn't have that luxury, could not... it was powerful. <br/><br/>Although my feeling is that this particular session was mostly elevated by what all the participants brought to the table, moreso than the game's rules, the system design was <i>extremely</i> top-notch. (And those who read Story Games know I don't say that lightly!) That makes me even more excited to check out <i>Bluebeard's Bride</i>, which Sarah Richardson also worked on, and I've been itching to play for quite some time.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>As a sidenote, I thought it was interesting, afterwards, that although I love fantastic elements in my fiction, all the games which enjoyed most were purely about real-world, human elements. For instance, when we played <i>Turning Point</i>, we all contributed elements to the story that we could relate to or had ourselves struggled with, and that made it very personal and touching.                        </div>

                            I played <b>Chuubo's Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine</b> twice. My group just started a new campaign, and this is my first time getting to experience the game playerside, because before this I've only GMed it. <br/>Playerside it's exactly as amazing of an experience as I was expecting it would be. This campaign so far has easily been the best experience I've ever had playing ttrpg, which is such a good feeling.                         </div>

                            Last Saturday, I attended a French Convention (cause, well, I'm french) in Rennes : Eclipse. I set up two games.<br/><br/>I began with a playtest of my current "I'm working on it" game : <b>"Les Enfants du V.A.G.I.N."</b>, a diesel-punk hack of Swords Without Master, where you played almost-orphans with limited superpowers chased by all kind of factions. And they're looking for their mothers, superpowers spies/agents, missing in action.<br/>Two people, which is great cause it was a configuration I did not test. Some things worked very well (character creation, story-building, no-prep scenario), others not (Hiding phase wasn't great, as were the Perilous Phases). <br/><br/>The story is on <a href="http://www.gulix.fr/blog/2018/03/20/eclipse-du-desert-pour-les-enfants-de-la-jungle-pour-les-aventuriers/" rel="nofollow">my blog</a> (in french), but here's a Summary : from Marseille to Le Caire by boat, escaping the Imperial Hussards in Le Caire, while going to the Barnum Circus. Finding clues, joining a mechanical race through the Desert towards Alger, meeting a member of the V.A.G.I.N., stealing documents from the Hussards, escaping someone from inside a prison. <br/><br/>Then, I played a <b>Swords Without Master</b> game, with my module "In the Hell of Jade". Four players, a former Blood Bowl player, a Naive Knight and his pig, a former slave at the head of a ghost army, and a vengeful lady. Very good game. Motifs were not that great, but the Perilous Phase were exciting, and the ending great (as every SWM game I've played). Lost City, Ape-Men, Batcave, Were-Gator assassin, Giant Cadaver Golem, and the Green Emperor, his soldiers and the terrifying Terra-Cotta Golems.                        </div>

                            Like <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>, I played a million games at Breakout last weekend.<br/><br/><b>[NM 156]</b> had us create an interesting distopia together.  It was more setting than system, but I liked the outcome of it.<br/><br/><b>The Ward</b> is a PBTA medical drama.  The way the sex move had been adapted into a matrix of questions in this game was brilliant, and involved a roll at the end.  My favourite part was this:<br/><br/><tt>After sex, either of you may ask the other if this is going somewhere:<br/><br/>If they say "Yes", +1<br/>If they say "No", -1<br/>If they hesitate, -2<tt><br/><br/>The way the game posed questions about your character and addictions went really worked for me, in terms of quickly building an interesting character.  I ended up with a new unintentionally-sexy genderfluid intern, who was addicted to their phone.  I'm probably going to repurpose this character into another game.<br/><br/><b>Turning Point</b> I was in this one with <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>, and agree that the groundedness of it worked really well.  I really enjoyed the game, and would like to play again.  Though, we played a playset about having or not having a baby, and I found myself disagreeing with how the game's voting system interpreted results of what "adventurous" meant in the context of a baby.  Having played the game once, though, I don't think I'd have the same problem again.<br/><br/>There was a playset of being a person who just discovered they have a kink, that their vanilla partner doesn't share, and what do you do about it which I'd really like to try.<br/><br/><b>Star Crossed</b> was brilliant.  I had the pleasure of playing with a guy whose background was in acting and directing (and not RP), but he didn't hesitate at all about the romance angle of the game.  We ended the game with 27 successful pulls from the Jenga tower, and our precarious little tower had attracted a small crowd by the end of the game.  The tower as a simulation of the navigation of the delicate situation between the characters was pretty fun experience.<br/><br/><b>Don't Rest Your Head</b> We played in the Dragon Age setting, where the madness mechanic simulated the Warden's experience with the Calling and heading into the Deep Roads to their deaths.  It was a pretty deep dive into the canon, but the mechanics really worked in support the themes of the game.  Kind of want to play a longer version of it, to allow the mechanics to breathe a little more; we only had a three hour slot, so any time we did roll we ended up adding lots of dice to our pools.<br/><br/>As <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> said, we got good use out of the support flower here, especially in supportive statements, and indicating things were cool and right on the line when things got gory.<br/><br/><b>Heaven's Collapse</b> was interesting for it's randomly assigned roles and relationships, and the way it solves the GMless problem with a deck of story prompts.  The game hit hard, and didn't stop.  I felt genuinely terrible for our characters and their world by the end of it.<br/><br/>My Princess Haldora was in love with the military commander, and myself and the queen's handmaiden ran an interesting story about feeling powerless, and trying to figure out what we could do about the situation, even though we had no obvious tools.  She started very naive and sheltered, and ended up seizing power out of frustration with the queen, watching the man she loved die of poison, and exercising what little control she could over the situation.  VERY satisfying.<br/><br/>Tomb Priestesses of the Nameless Dead was sadly cancelled, so instead I played <b>Magister Lor</b> I played the evil apprentice, and my relationship with my demon master was sexual and manipulative.  Ultimately, sibling love turned the tide, but only after I was betrayed by my demon.  Pretty fun experience, though more rolling than I'm used to.<br/><br/><b>Ghost Court</b> was pretty fun.  James D'Amato ran this one, and I ended up as the second judge.  He'd been more traditional, so I played Judge Slymarrow towards classically conservative (preferring business owners, assuming workers were lazy) and a little lecherous after one of the defendants unbuttoned her shirt for the judge's benefit.</tt></tt> </div>

It's deliberate. Yep, the name in french has the same meaning.<br/><br/>And changing or not is currently in discussion in my head. <br/><br/>This game started as the result of a contest : "One Title. One Page. One RPG". The title was given to me through a random french novel title generator. And I struggled with it. Then came with an Acronym : Vth of the Agence Gouvernementale des Individus Nouveaux (Governement Agency for New Individuals). There is a part of the story behind it. And I got both feedback on the title. Some like it, it helps raise interest in the game, it has meaning in the game. Others clearly don't like it, and even don't want to know anything about the game. <br/><br/>Right now, for my first playtest, I keep it. But it could change ...<br/><br/><a href="http://www.gulix.fr/blog/2018/02/20/cest-lhistoire-dun-titre/" rel="nofollow">French post about the title and my questions about it.</a> </div>

                            Monthly Indie game day at the FLGS.<br/><br/>One of the new players was eager to run <b>Ryuutama</b>. It was... okay. It has a fairly straightforward Cortex type mechanic where stats are dice and you combine dice from two stats (or sometimes the same stat twice). The game play and challenges were okay, but it seems to involve more resource management than I really find entertaining these days.<br/><br/>The GM was fairly new (actually, she says this is the first game she GMed). All things considered it went okay, and we had two well heeled GMs at the table who could see the constraints of the system and work with them.<br/><br/>FWIW, it feels like it is targeted at the same sort of experience that Mouse Guard was after, but I like it better than that system.                        </div>

                            Squeezed in a playtests session of <b>Stand in Defiance</b> on Thursday.<br/><br/>And wow. There was some intensity there. First scene was a character having sex with the god of death, then trading her soul to them in exchange for the secret of how to escape the underworld, in hope of freeing her children from mortality.<br/><br/>All of this is stuff the game's designed to support, but damn! I wasn't expecting a new player to charge straight into it to that extent.<br/><br/>Made for a great session, though, and the whole group's excited for next time, which is exactly how you want it to go.

<i>Leviathan Manifesto</i>: our 12th case ended disastrously, again, as I drew the 3rd King. Perhaps our cases have grown exceedingly complicated by now, to the point of being impossible to solve? We've agreed that our next one is going to be a more straightforward spin-off from a personal scene. We'll use some other set of rules (<i>Microscope</i>, perhaps) to get back at the main storyline later. <a href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">@James_Mullen</a> <br/><br/>I've also run a game of <i>On Mighty Thews</i> which, as we had to cut it short of a climax due to RL, is probably going to grow into a two-parter. I'm convinced 2 PCs to 1 GM is the best ratio for OMT, both in terms of resonance with the literary sources and as the sweet spot of sharing creative work in a low-noise environment, where no threads are left unattended. <a href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">@Simon_C</a> </div>

Yeah, <a href="https://onmightythews.com/" rel="nofollow">On Mighty Thews</a> was released in 2011 AFAIK and has been available since as <a href="http://theunstore.com/index.php/unstore/game/121" rel="nofollow">a cheap PDF buy from the Unstore</a> (there was also an Italian translation published a mere couple years ago, which I helped with).<br/>The one big change in the final version compared to the many draft and playtest iterations I've tried out are the rules for sorcery. Those are, in my opinion, the very best ever designed for a strictly swords &amp; sorcery game (or are perhaps tied with <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i> - i.e. Ron Edwards's <i>Sorcerer</i> - in this regard) consisting just of practical applications of Lore, which ties seamlessly into the core mechanics.<br/>Curiously, the simple and almost flawless instructions for long-term play (i.e. making it just a string of one-shots, with the options of redesigning characters from scratch at any time) seem to be missing from the final edition, but being familiar with those from any previous iteration is more than enough.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the genre, also check out <a href="http://www.worldswithoutmaster.com/" rel="nofollow">Worlds Without Master</a> and the games published in it (full disclosure: I wrote the one in the 1st issue). The "flagship" there is Eppy Ravachol's <i>Swords Without Master</i>, found in Issue 3 - a very interesting and quite innovative game, if somewhat challenging.                        </div>

Perhaps, in conjunction with your 'Highlighting Characters' rules, there is a way to soften the blow of the 3rd King? With the 'Small, Inconspicuous Hack', you could just say that an operative may sacrifice themselves to ignore the 3rd King and you carry on playing until the 4th King instead? It kind of sucks if there are only two of you playing though. :-(<br/><br/>With 'The Bigger Hack', an operative could burn their issue for the same result as above; instead of leaving play, they erase their Personal Issue and lose any cards or check-boxes relating to it. They get to narrate just how that aspect of their personal life crashes &amp; burns for good, in the worst possible way, perhaps by crossing paths with the case the operatives are on? When they pick up the next case, they choose a new Personal Issue, quite possibly one resulting from how their previous issue dramatically &amp; suddenly went to Hell.                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">@James_Mullen</a> Those are smart, interesting hacks. For the generally pessimistic tone of our "series", option no. 2 seems almost too soft (our operatives personal life, if they can be said to have one, is already crashing and burning at every turn and quite permanently on fire by now) - but now I'm really tempted to put the self-sacrifice option on the table, if wary that it <i>will</i> be chosen as soon as the opportunity presents itself again. That might, in fact, be the most fitting ending!

<a href="/forums/profile/Rafu">@Rafu</a>,<br/><br/>It's hard to explain in a short form, but, basically, my idea was for a character who inadvertently Bound a Demon by accidentally murdering his mother-in-law. He has no idea what's going on or why she's still alive and following him around.<br/><br/>He's discovering the true nature of his reality now, in play.<br/><br/>None of this is a good fit "by the book"! But, with some good communication within our group, I think we're making it work. I feel bad, sometimes, though, that I've made the GM's job so challenging.                        </div>

                            Ah! I was expecting that. ;-P<br/><br/>It's only against the rules if you, as an author-player, really want the binding to be "involuntary". That's not the same as the character <i>claiming</i> he didn't mean to, or claiming he didn't mean to kill the lady, or the character not understanding what's going on (possibly the very definition of a Naive sorcerer).<br/>I suppose he accidentally murdered her, then <i>wished really hard</i> he had not - and "she" just came back from the dead? So that his wishing his victim back to life was the act of binding (and, arguably, summoning)? I love naive, well-meaning sorcerers! I really do.<br/>Also, it would arguably be against the rules, and possibly make the GM's job way tougher, if you had no Kicker but "I happen to have bound a demon" - but I don't believe there is any game-design requirement for you to have been in a status quo as a sorcerer for any length of time. Thus, "I've murdered my mother-in-law" would be an entirely legit Kicker, I suppose.<br/> </div>

                            Played a short game of <i>Psi*Run</i> last night. I was GM. We were three grown-ups plus the (11 yrs old, I think?) child of one of us. That sort of setup felt a bit intimidating to me, as I don't have a lot of experience interacting with children and I especially have next to zero experience interacting with children <i>and their parents</i> at the same time - but I was eager to accept a challenge and I'm happy I did, as the outcome was entirely satisfying and non-problematic. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Playtested my first-ever, designed-game, Darkening Forest.  Did the character creation this session.  There were problems. It's very alpha-version at the moment.                        </div>

                            Running the third session (or second, if we don't count the initial brainstorming/character creation session) of my <i>Apocalypse World</i> campaign.<br/><br/>My favourite moment was when Barnum, our Hardholder, walks into the abandoned research facility to discover that his aged friend, Abel, hasn't spoken to him for several years because he's turning into vegetation and can no longer leave his secluded cave (he is literally rooted to the spot). Barnum reaches into the dirt, where he thinks Abel's hand should be, and their minds touch.                        </div>

                            Character Generation for Our Ladies of Sorrow, a Call of Cthulhu (6th ed) campaign I'm running with Trail of Cthulhu, including some Fall of Delta Green tweaks, transplanting from the 2000s to the 1960s. One player explained how he loves taking the poisoned apple and handed me a huge metaphorical apple that I'm trying to poison appropriately. The end of the session was the ceremonial "Is there any day in the next month all of us can meet?" We seem to have made one by sheer force of will.<br/><br/>I've copied the conversion notes for the first scenario onto a printout of it and have to review for things that ping my "Why are you charging for this [Core Clue] / [Red Herring]?" meter, and figure out what needs to be tweaked because it doesn't exist in 1963. For some reason, all the NPCs in a campaign in the 2000s have computers... I think most of these turn into typewriters, and some of them just vanish.                        </div>

                            We played <b>Fiasco 'Rewind'</b> (the order of the scenes were strictly in line &amp; backwards similar to the movies Memento and Irreversible). We used Gangster London playset which is very generic and flexible. Personal highlight: We discovered why would anybody consider a porn shooting with a chained stolen tiger on set  a good idea!<br/><br/>Also it was the third time that Ive tried <b>Bedlam Beautiful.</b> I'm starting to think that this very dark game has an actually hopeful and positive assumption at it's core about finding true love.                        </div>

                            TSS2016 is a VERY realistic model of the experience of working in technical support. It looks like a simple children's game, but the mechanics are finely tuned to cause suffering. The players and spectators will laugh while dying on the inside.<br/><br/>People who have actual experience in that line of work will feel discomfort, even from just watching others play.                         </div>

                            Started a 13th episode in our 2-player <i>Leviathan Manifesto</i> game. We chose to focus on a "smaller" case, not connected to the main emerging "villains" in our story and their thick web of conspiracies - so we sorta zoomed in on a personal scene from ep <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2312&amp;Mode=like">#12</a> and developed that into a full-fledged case. But playing cards, you now, have a mind of their own... Not one, but <i>two</i> kings came up very early in the game (I think we've drawn fewer than 10 cards so far), followed by a personal card. Thus, we have this very tight crisis situation where a guy with a stolen gun is looking for his wife, fully intent on murdering her and possibly her lover - and this was 2 days ago. We need to stop him in as few moves as we can, and should another king appear it might well turn out the woman was dead already before we even started investigating the situation! Personal scene was really good, quite memorable.<br/><br/>Played <i>Sorcerer</i> ("The Mother-ships") again after one week's hiatus. We know we'll have to skip the next two weekends for various unrelated reasons and that's quite disappointing (even though we'll probably get to play other games). We really feel like bringing this story to an ending (though we're afraid it might be anything but a happy end) but problems seems to keep snowballing and getting at the PCs from multiple fronts.                        </div>

                            Tried out the demo of <b>AW (Hatchet City and Wild-Blue)</b> with 2e rules. This one-shot from Vincent tries to emulate the feeling of the 4th session in medias res with the help of very cool love letters. <br/><br/>Everybody seemed to enjoy the game, especially the two trad gamer. The 'bangs' create a very fascinating starting situation, but there are so many threats (8 at least!), so many side characters (who is a spy, who is injured, who has secret crush on who), so many nuances that it would be impossible to understand or keep them in mind even if we have played through 3 real sessions and established them organically.<br/><br/>Reads so good, tastes 'too much'. I recommend it if you are brave enough to cut awesome things out.                        </div>

<b>Blood &amp; Water:</b> a Hangouts game, where the residents were a gargoyle sorcerer, zombie football player and soul-stealing photographer, sharing a large &amp; expensive house on the border of Fulham and Chelsea.<br/><br/>Most of the plot revolved around the football player being outed by the tabloids after a misunderstanding in some bushes at the local park, followed up by the photographer looking for more opportunities to make money by selling his friend's story to the press. The session ended with the sorcerer making a simulacrum of the footballer out of clay &amp; blood, then bringing it to life so the photographer could take scandalous pictures of it! We'll hopefully see how that works out next week.                        </div>

                            I ran D&amp;D 5e. Yes... the RPG monkey climbed onto my back again...<br/>I printed a couple of three-to-four page modules and placed them near/in Phandalin and said that it was three years after the events of LMoP. Put the players in the Stonehill Inn and gave them rumors. That case, in case they didn't bite on any of those rumors, I had all the Sword Coast stuff from LMoP, PotA and SKT to riff off of.<br/><br/>However, they did go for one of the rumors and they also took one of my NPCs in an unexpected direction, which was cool.<br/><br/>I didn't use any of the more hillfolky-derived rules but I missed them. Some players argued for a long time about which of the many leads to follow. In hindsight, I wish I had tried saying "OK, whoever gives in first gets insp".                        </div>

                            D&amp;D 5E with a twist.  Leveling up is based on an "alignment vote" at the end of each session.  It is  a bit reminiscent of the trait vote in Burning Wheel.  Each player recalls an action of other PCs and assigns an alignment to the act.  Leveling up can be attempted when a PC has actions equal to current level in their current alignment, actions equal to 1 1/2x level in near-alignments, and 2x level in opposing alignments.  The system is proving influential in shaping PC actions!                             </div>

We chose to focus on a "smaller" case, not connected to the main emerging "villains" in our story and their thick web of conspiracies - so we sorta zoomed in on a personal scene from ep <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2312&amp;Mode=like">#12</a> and developed that into a full-fledged case. But playing cards, you now, have a mind of their own... Not one, but <i>two</i> kings came up very early in the game (I think we've drawn fewer than 10 cards so far), followed by a personal card. Thus, we have this very tight crisis situation where a guy with a stolen gun is looking for his wife, fully intent on murdering her and possibly her lover - and this was 2 days ago. We need to stop him in as few moves as we can, and should another king appear it might well turn out the woman was dead already before we even started investigating the situation! Personal scene was really good, quite memorable.</p></div></blockquote>
Good news: we managed to get the violent husband arrested for carrying an unauthorized firearm - by hijacking a narc investigation and tricking a drug-dealer into interacting with the subject. Charges for attempting to trade a stolen gun with illegal drugs should keep the wannabe murderer busy long enough for his wife to move somewhere safe, at least. First successfully closed case in a while!<br/><br/>Apart from that, I was quite busy last weekend, demonstrating edu-larp scenarios to high-schoolers and their teachers at a big, headache-inducing fair. The first Italian edu-larp conference was quite the success, I dare say.                        </div>

                            Saturday had a pre-character creation get together for all but two of us to watch the Oldman Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy to get a feel for 1977 Dracula Dossier. This version was recommended by Aviatrix, who couldn't make it, but had clearly seen it, and I think it was the right call.<br/><br/>It's not just that it's easier to fit in a 2 hour movie than 6 or 7 hours worth of miniseries, but more that it's the distilled essence that's starting to work on my brain. Also, it's probably going to be easier for me to go from the cut-it-to-the-bone version to the more expansive miniseries and book than to do it the other way around. And we've had some useful analysis from a gaming point of view.<br/><br/>Josh: Is there any Traffic Analysis in that movie?<br/><br/>Me: Yes, that scene where they look through a bunch of information about who left the Circus and spotted anomalies.<br/><br/>Me: So, that bit where he gets his bag back which is against policy, that's totally an interpersonal spend.<br/><br/>Josh: Okay, I can see that. What skill is he using?<br/><br/>Me: Um, Cop Talk? You know -- Co-workerness? Er...<br/><br/>Josh: Doesn't sound right.<br/><br/>Me: ... Ah! Reassurance! "I just need to look this thing up and you can take it right back."<br/><br/>And of course, looking at what is and isn't core from a gaming point of view, where the ending isn't guaranteed.<br/><br/>It was also interesting watching fairly solid procedural which did NOT feel the need to suddenly do an "Everything you the viewer thought you know about what was going on is wrong!" It's been a long time since I watched one of those.                        </div>

                            Session 18 of my OSR campaign. The players have been in the same dungeon since session 13, at first lured by the prospect of an underworld market then embroiled in the tribal warfare between warrior spirits (3' samurai) and pigmen. They almost ran out of light and were completely lost but eventually navigated their way out. The characters were 1st and 2nd level going in and brought over 12,000gp worth of loot with them out. <br/><br/>This was their first serious dungeon expedition with no fatalities, although one PC and a henchman nearly died but got lucky on their mortal wounds rolls. One PC chose to stay in the dungeon to rule over the warrior spirits. He will eventually be faced with the choice to leave the dungeon or his humanity.                        </div>

                            Ran my <b>Pathfinder </b>game with the dueling adventuring parties again, and it was chaos. The villain trapped in a magic mirror was trying to manipulate both parties to free him under the assumption that they would be trapped in his place. The NPC party caught on to the idea there was something sinister going on here, so they decided to try to manipulate the PCs into taking the fall, and offer then the missing macguffins they needed to free the mirror man.<br/><br/>Of course, PCs don't follow the script for NPCs any better than they do the DM. They see the representatives approaching to make their offer, and the halfling sorcerer decides to teleport to the pyramid where the NPCs were exploring and basically snatch the macguffin and take down the NPC leader. The one I was planning to make a longstanding villain.<br/><br/>Ah well, that's the way emergent gameplay works sometimes. Time to promote a lackey to lead villain.                        </div>

<b>Red Carnations on a Black Grave</b> online at the Gauntlet: our gayest setup ever! Good game but I need to think about how to speed up the gameplay a bit online; at the table the game clocks in well under 4 hours usually.<br/><br/><b>Apocalypse World 2e</b>: After the chaos of the Jackal Riots, my Hardholder stripped the local farms of their population and brought them inside the walls of Kamlan--just in time, as the Running of the Cannibals began early. Abe the Angel has taken up psychotherapy for the resentful survivors of the riots, and Honda the ex-cannibal had his name taken away so he can be reborn as a member of the Hold. A reconnaissance trip to Cannibal territory brought the Hardholder &amp; Gunlugger face to face with the Brainer, now leader of the Circle cult. Attempts at negotiation failed--is open war coming?

                            Playtests for the Great Game are going well! Fiddling a lot with Meetings and Tailing Agents, but making a lot of progress, especially for guiding scene framing and meaningful player-player interaction. Since introducing tailing agents, zooming in on operations has been really fun, especially for the Industrialist.<br/><br/>The back and forth with their enemy, Codename Anchor, is exciting. Through some clever maneuverings have narrowed him down to a Military Advisor, one of about twenty, and have their suspicions as to who. Codename Blumenhandler has had her agent befriend one of the suspects maids, and is working operations to convince her to murder her ex. The plan is that after having her kill once, she'll be willing to kill again, so they can recruit her as an Assassin to kill the Anchor, but that plan hinges that their first suspect is the Anchor after all, so we'll see how things play out next time. Blacksmith is now being confronted with sabotage from Codename Lotus, who has been waiting along the sidelines for Anchor to start to fall. Can't wait to see how it plays out.                        </div>

                            Ran my first session 2 of a <b>Masks: A New Generation</b> game! Woot!<br/><br/>I love the way the game generates random plot elements. The heroes' "when we first came together" story had them destroying their boarding house for super powered teens. So their wise headmaster had them sign up for a rival school, the Rook Academy (think "Xavier's school if it was run by Lex Luthor"). One character (being played by my daughter) did not get an invitation to the Rook Academy. BUT she entered and won a contest to join the Academy's marquee team, the Superior Six. Then (to get rid of a condition) she got invited to a new student party for Rook and destroyed a trophy of one of the Rook Academy's sports teams. So all the Rook students are pissed at her, but nobody knows who she is, and she is on their marquee team.<br/><br/>Other things that happened:<br/>- Ex 113 AKA "Excel", another character, passed the challenge to enter the superior six, but pissed off the judge<br/>- Another student, Nightgaunt, was already a student at the academy, but got there under false pretenses.<br/><br/>The situation is pregnant with dramatic possibilities.                        </div>

I say random, but I include "conceived on the spot due to player actions":<br/>- I didn't initially picture someone bringing a trophy to the Rook student party, but my daughter was looking to get rid of her Janus' <i>angry</i> condition by destroying something important, and it's the first thing I thought of.<br/>- I used a custom move (nicked from the G+ masks group) for the party that had the players conceiving other Rook Academy students on the spot, then the dice determined their relationship with the students.<br/>- I also made a custom move for the competition. The move resulted in the players learning random dark secrets and making up more new students.<br/>- And the fact that the only PC to get into the Superior Six wasn't even a student at the academy was a dice-inspired twist.                        </div>

The one who is an ideologically-motivated serial murderer of authority figures starting an all-crew meeting to establish leadership (ahem...) and it turns out the one who's <i>only</i> loyal to himself  was also the only one to carry a gun on-board. My PC actually designed our ship, but another one has been brain-implanted to become the only one capable of piloting it - he's both highly instable, and an anarchist leader type who's been lying to me all the time just to get the ship for his rebellion. Much more complex and politically charged than my average <i>Vast &amp; Starlit</i> experience!<br/>However, with such a significant sort of distraction as a small child in our not-especially-toddler-proof home (also unequal a distraction, in that of course her parents where disproportionately more taken with her than anybody else) we could actually squeeze way fewer play than usual in our 4-hour afternoon. We called it a promising first episode and resolved on continuing from there next time we manage to meet as a group - which might not be in a while, though. That's always quite the underwhelming development - in hindsight, I perhaps should have insisted on picking a strictly one-shot game instead (but then, I would probably still have mis-estimated how long a game, by a gross factor).                        </div>

                            I played <b>Chuubo's Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine</b> last night. We'd pushed back our Sunday session to Monday night because my fiancee hadn't been feeling well on Sunday night, so she wasn't able to roleplay that night. <br/>It was a short session, compared to our normal sessions, since she still wasn't feeling 100%, but it was really nice and we got a decent amount done. My character had a big breakthrough on a project she's working on, and she also got to hang out with her sister, who was visiting for the weekend. A lot of fun stuff, with some feelsy stuff related to my character's girlfriend's upcoming fight with this void monster who she has the start of a romance with, who she's destined to kill.<br/>It was just all around a really good session, as usual.                        </div>

                            Two more sessions of our <b>Uncharted Worlds</b> "A-Team meets Star Wars" game (we're cramming), including a really good one where 3 of the 4 players whose characters were MIA and presumed dead played random troublemaking NPCs in the colony fleet, just to foment insurrection and torture the one remaining PC trying to hold things together. Serious Battlestar Galactica-time. Excellent stuff.<br/><br/>Also played a <b>Kingdom</b> game about a community pool. Nite Swim 4evar.<br/> </div>

                            90-minute Roll20 session for my Mirrorrim megadungeon campaign for <b>D&amp;D 5e</b>. <br/><br/>Two 5th level characters who were dungeon veterans and one 1st level character who had not been in this particular dungeon at all. They took him for a "tour" that took about 60 minutes to get to the new stuff they had not explored.<br/><br/>Veteran rogue character gets a little antsy and wanders away from the party without being careful... into a wraith.<br/><br/>Wraith rolls 18 for Stealth.<br/>Wraith rolls highest for initiative.<br/>Wraith attacks the rogue, rolls a critical hit, deals like 55 damage.<br/>Even if the damage hadn't insta-deathed the rogue, the rogue failed his save vs. death anyway.<br/><br/>Then the rookie bard through a <i>vicious mockery</i> at the wraith for 3 damage. Then the veteran druid yelled, "Run, fool!" and they tore out of the dungeon at full speed.<br/><br/>Now I get to stat up a wight version of the ratling monk. Imagine a wight that attacks with unarmed strikes and wears a cloak of protection +1... and who knows the party's SOP.                        </div>

                            Yesterday, I played the frantic GM trying to figure out if I should run our first session with one player bowing out as folks were getting on the train or to the subway -- it was one of those cases where you're suddenly sick or had hoped you weren't getting sick or were getting over being sick, and you suddenly realize nope, you're not up for going out. With two players less than comfortable with the idea of a first session without all the players, I ultimately decided to call this one off, and we've rescheduled for next month, with me doing a running tally.<br/><br/>Me: So, tell me your BAD days, oh players. Mine are [days].<br/>Player: Here are my good days.<br/>Me: *headdesk*<br/>Me: *deep breath* (looks at player's good days) Okay, between us, we have 6 good days in the next 6 weeks.<br/>Player 2: Two of those are bad for me.<br/>Me: Four good days.<br/>Player 3: One of those is bad for me.<br/>Me: Okay, three...<br/>Player 4: Two of those are bad for me.<br/>Me: SOLD! We know what day we're gaming on! (hastily calendars)<br/><br/>Today, I ran the first session of Kerberos Fate II: Machinery of Life, after a several months' hiatus. We have Dorian Gray, Ladon the self effacing plant mage bastard son of a scandalous earl, Felicity the clockwork shapeshifting woman, and Dr. Alexander the extraordinary physician who'd been kidnapped to the Promethea of the Dark Harvest setting on account of the player had to miss the last session before the hiatus and things worked out that way.<br/><br/>The good doctor was rescued and the PCs have decided they need to burn the country to the ground, or at least most of those in positions of power, and we'll see where that goes. Dialogue bits:<br/><br/>Dorian: You know, for someone so concerned with being respectable, you're certainly interested in making a scandal. You're more your father's son than you think you are.<br/><br/>Ladon: You are trying to distract me.<br/><br/>Dorian: So, do you want to have an affair with me?<br/><br/>Ladon: We've been over this already.<br/><br/>Dorian: So?<br/><br/>Ladon: You know she can hear you?<br/><br/>Felicity (who's had / is having an affair with Dorian and assumes Ladon is referring to here): And?<br/><br/>Ladon was referring to his wife, who is in another country and cannot, in fact, magically hear any of this.<br/><br/>Felicity: Maybe he just wants to be faithful to his wife.<br/><br/>Dorian: ... No.<br/><br/>Ladon remained monogamous. He and Felicity continued to shoot down Dorian's more outre suggestions about how to infiltrate Promethea in favor of being subtle and drawing as little attention to themselves as possible.<br/><br/>Dorian: You have no sense of aesthetics, either of you! Honestly!<br/><br/>At one point, Felicity suggested she shapeshift into a boa.<br/><br/>Felicity: The kind made of snakeskin.<br/><br/>Dorian: Aren't all boas made of snakeskin?<br/><br/>Felicity: Some are made of feathers.<br/><br/>Dorian: Good Heavens!<br/><br/>Amity (Felicity's brother, also having an affair with Dorian): You've never heard of a feather boa? Dorian, when we're in Paris again, I must show you one! You'll like it.<br/><br/>And there were shapeshifting hijinks resulting from low rolls. Felicity:<br/><br/>* Succeeding at a cost, wound up looking exactly like some Promethean noble's prize poodle, and we had a chase! (She got away.)<br/>* Tried to turn into a chimera, just to see if she could. She couldn't.<br/>* Succeeding at a cost, hid from the requisite authorities barging in to arrest everyone by turning into an armoire -- but got stuck in that position and had to be guided carefully out of it by Ladon.<br/><br/><br/> </div>

She was doing well enough the next day to be Dorian. I'm not so into Doodle, which says more about me than Doodle, and the amount of time it took to reschedule was actually brief. It was just the "5 adults, 6 weeks, and 6...4...3...1 good day!" that was all too interesting (and Doodle can't solve that we've a lot we want and / or must do and only so many days in a week or month).                        </div>

                            Ran the beginning of book 3 of the <b>Starfinder</b> adventure path.<br/><br/>I may have mentioned this before, but despite being totally down with Pathfinder, I'm not feeling Starfinder. I am used to other games for SF, and don't feel the same sort of latitude I do with systems I am more comfortable with.<br/><br/>One thing I will say: the adventures in the AP aren't great. But I am learning to tolerate them in my own way. In essence by doing what I would do in Traveller: let players solve problems in their own way. There is sort of a needle-threading moment in adventure thing that sort of relies on players parleying with a group of pirates that attacked them. Not too surprisingly, the players weren't all conversational. The parley was going long and still none of the players asked for the information they pretty much needed to proceed. <br/><br/>But the player of the ysoki (ratfolk) mechanic asked if he could plant a bug. The game and adventure didn't provide for it, but I was like "yes! Hell yes!" In essence, I let him get the information he needed by spying.                        </div>

                            We had our monthly indie gameday at the FLGS. This time around, I recruited someone else to run something (seeings how I was too busy prepping stuff to run at Camp NC Gameday.) A friend mentioned his interest in running <b>Blades in the Dark</b>. As I had yet to play it, but heard other friends speak of it in glowing terms, I was more than happy to take him up on his offer.<br/><br/>It was pretty fun. Though it leveraged the idea of playbooks, it was more different from "mainstream" PbtA than I was expecting. I made a leach character. She had sufficient ability to control her fate to be interesting, but had fallibility enough to make it exciting. Having little exposure to the setting, I spun off the idea of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Witch_of_Rose_Hall" rel="nofollow">the White Witch of Rose Hall</a> to make a mixed heritage house apothecary in service of a Noble witch, who went back to the main city after another lord employed her after her lady was killed.                        </div>

                            I finally got a chance to Overplay <b>Swords Without Master</b> with some friends, and we mostly enjoyed it (possibly except one of us). Yay!<br/><br/>"My" table consists in a few long-time-ago trad gamers, and me very interested in story/indie games for some time but with little experience since the trad days.<br/><br/>We didn't finish the game, by the rules, because it was getting late, and we reached a very satisfying conclusion right as we should've entered the end game (the rogues slayed the Bad Guys and replaced them in the management of their casino/brothel in the City catacombs).<br/><br/>My thoughts:
<ul>
<li>A large table is quite a hindrance for passing the dice.</li>
<li>We went quite gonzo, but that was expected with this group, and not entirely unwelcome (we had a good time and some good laughs).</li>
<li>The rules are completely narrative-oriented, and structure the narrative VERY hard. The good thing about this, though, is that you can't really fall back to a traditional style of play: the rules enforce the style, and once you accept and embrace their iron fist, the result is unapologetically Sword and Sorcery.</li>
<li>The rules are so utterly different than trad games, that getting some of them to "click" into place took a bit more effort than I had anticipated: for example almost all of my players' first tendency was to write and use their Feats Heroic as something their rogues were <i>allowed</i> to do ("because now it's written in my char sheet"), instead as a special narrative tool.</li>
<li>Some players had a bit of resistance against accepting narrative authority - especially in the Discovery and Rogues' Phases - and they tended to slip back into a more conservative character role. One of them later told me that he wasn't really comfortable in the author's role. It's interesting to note that - in the same vein - he also had a tendency of interpreting the tones as his rogue's mood, rather than in a wider scope; furthermore, he also prefers heavily prepped sessions where he feels more like he's discovering plot and stuff rather than inventing. All of these aspects fit together: he's clearly oriented towards immersing in his character, rather than the story (I'm sure there's a forgite lingo for this, but I'm also sure I would misquote it).</li>
<li>None of the players spontaneously narrated their rogues into trouble, unless they rolled a stymie: they used their authority to narrate a solution as soon as they could.</li>
<li>Only one player spontaneously narrated extra scene details outside of his rogue actions. If I remember correctly, the others added to the story only directly through their rogues (unless forced by the Discovery Phase).</li>
<li>The Discovery Phase is really good at adding material and directions to go on with the story, much more than I thought just by reading the rules (or even watching actual plays!).</li>
</ul> </div>

<b>Red Carnations</b> online with the Gauntlet. Had someone basically new to Story Games in the mix this go around, so glad to bring that to the table. A little more diffused story but the players told me it still packed an emotional wallop.<br/><br/><b>Dusk City Outlaws</b> a pickup online game. We were asked to steal a valuable necklace off the neck of a dead aristocrat; fortunately her family customs included a day-long drama recounting the elements of her life. My Vesper used one of her covers as the Baroness Arakadina, a retired actress, to take over the production. "I am coming out of retirement to help you. Please, it is not necessary to thank." Fun game and the second time I've got to play with Jim Crocker of Mythos Games.<br/><br/><b>Good Society</b> also online. I played Elizabeth "Lizzie" Brandon, daughter of the Rt. Honorable Lord Philip and Lady Emma Brandon, newly arrived in town and staying with her dowager aunt. Her old flame Capt. Archie Townsend is in town as part of her brother-in-law's regiment--but who is this intelligent young Mr. Charles Croft who engaged in a delightful conversation on the merits of Mr. Chapman's versus Mr. Pope's translations of Homer? A delightful game and everyone was on Regency point.                        </div>

                            First session of <b>Tomb of Annihilation</b>!<br/>City stuff woefully underprepped on my end. And also they kept looking for an inn and there are no inns?! like why are there no inns. after they kept on looking I made one up. it was awesome. Chuil's Inn. Also a reseller of fine smithing products.<br/><br/>Jungle stuff more better prepped. They almost died vs giant wasps. Pretty awesome.<br/><br/>The the level 9 uber-DMPC:s that they hired as guides almost died vs the wasps too. The PCs had to save them. I had the players control the guides in combat, and the way 5e works with opportunity attacks made for some interesting tactics of both the system mastery version and of the fictional positioning version. Because the new player was hiding in the water and throwing spells while the more experienced players were managing aggro/OA and focusing fire. And the combination worked great. Sacred Flame in a rainy jungle with the scent of flowers and then giant wasps died.<br/><br/>I loved the new player but we were all a bit shy around them. they found their footing quickly enough. they really wanted to keep playing more sessions too so that's good, hope they stay in the group<br/><br/>The DMPCs... Chris Perkins is the guy you go to if you want to ham it up with snowflakey, often humorous NPCs of various power levels. And I do, so that's a good match for me. I love some of his NPCs including these. Just that it sucks if they outshine the PCs when it comes to the actual heroics. You have to stolen-car them and crosshair them and I hope I do that.                        </div>

                            Attended NCGD. I ran two PbtA games: <b>City of Mist</b> and <b>Masks: A New Generation</b>. I generally feel like Masks is a better game, but I think for this weekend, City of Mist went better. <br/><br/>City of Mist determines modifiers to your moves by determining which a series of tags applies to the roll, which means you need to make I series of evaluations for every roll. That seems like it could become tiring pretty quick. But I told players just to go by their gut and not overthink it, and I wasn't going to question it too hard, and it went pretty well.<br/><br/>Another thing I was a littler worried about was the "Stop. Holding. Back." move, which lets to player perform a gamechanging move in exchange for setting the stakes super high. I worried this would prove too convenient a solution to their problems, but it made for some dramatic scenes in the hands of creative players.                        </div>

                            Game I played at NCGD:<br/><b>- An <i>"Eclipse Phase Hack"</i></b> - run by my old friend Kirin the creator of Old School Hack. Outside the setting and concepts, carried little in common with the actual Eclipse Phase. The dice system needs some work, but the character sheet was super cool and did eclipse phase better than eclipse phase. You start with a character sheet that has just you mind. But then you add your sleeve with a character sheet that is actually a sleeve. You slide the character sheet inside the sleeve sheet.<br/><br/><b>Swords of the Serpentine </b>- For those who don't know, this is a fantasy Gumshoe game to be published in 2019. I've actually played it a few times before, usually under the author. But this time around, the author was a fellow player and handed the reins to someone else (how this happened was a long story). It's a cool spin that has some of the same urban fantasy feel as the likes of Blades in the Dark, but with an investigation focus rather than a caper focus.<br/><br/><b>Turbo Breakers </b>- A little "dungeon crawls in the modern world" game. Written by John Harper, I guess as a short project on his patreon. It didn't feel that different from bog standard D&amp;D. It had many of the same basic mechanical features as Blades in the Dark, etc., but didn't have any real marquee mechanics that made it that special.<br/><br/> </div>

                            Kirin is perhaps the best UX designer / rules explainer working in RPGs. If they could be matched up with a game designer of the same caliber, that would be awesome. Like, my fave game is 5e and I sing Crawford's praises daily, but the books aren't easy to learn from and use.                        </div>

                            Ran a 2-1/2 hour game of D&amp;D 5e where the PCs chased after the pirate captain Falco Grigio, who'd stolen the Oracle of Anagrel from the city of Salarossa, through the tunnels of an ancient island-fortress in the middle of the Sea of Pearls. Their elvish magician got lost in the tunnels during the chase and, spying a huge pearl in the mouth of giant clam sitting in the  awash in sea water in a clam bed on the floor of a luminescent lichen-lit cavern, got his foot caught in a clamshell after being swept off his feet by the ebb and flow of water in the cavern. Luckily the other party members found him and managed to rescue him, but Falco Grigio made his escape as the only PC who managed to track him down found himself rowing in circles in a dinghy while trying to intercept the buccaneer before he got back to his ship. However, the PCs think that Grigio traded the Oracle to a sea witch somewhere in the island as ransom for his lost love, so next session they're going back in.<br/><br/>The best part of this game is going around the table and giving each other "checks" for alignment behavior in lieu of experience points. It is a little like Keys, but it makes the players pay attention to what everyone else is doing. Lots of fun.                        </div>

                            I ran the first session of a campaign of <b>Coriolis</b> yesterday. This is going to be an interesting game. The elevator pitch is basically sandbox-y Firefly-meets-Babylon 5-meets-Arabian Nights. My group's first impressions in actual play basically match that, although there's also a heavy helping of managing the party's economics. Not only is the game based around the premise of the party as the crew of a small ship with a bunch of debt (a la the classic Traveller set up), the game turns out to push the feeling of struggling against economic scarcity in a bunch of other ways, like ship maintenance costs, the important of (often pricey) gear, monthly living expenses, and so on. I think this is going to prove quite satisfying to my group though. They wanted to be scuzzy free traders and data smugglers after all...                        </div>

                            I had a pick-up game of <b>Troublemakers</b> yesterday, when our Monday MotW game failed to happen again, and we set the dials for 'Victorian fantasia.' I had a vague plot in mind, until in the first scene a young boy at a hunting party was forced to fire a shotgun and chased the bird he shot down into the woods where it fell. Everything then escalated from the discovery that the bird was made of brass and it flew off with him to a nearby factory, with the other kids soon in pursuit...                        </div>

                            Last weekend, Barbara and me were crazy enough to fly all the way to Tallinn, Estonia, for the <a href="http://tallinnlarpfestival.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Tallinn Larp Festival</a>. There we run our chamber larp/freeform/whatever you call 'em scenarios <i>Something About Us</i> (freshly translated to English, find it in the collective book <a href="http://nessundove.it/en/shop/rpg/" rel="nofollow">Crescendo Giocoso</a>) and <i>Awkward</i> (<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sitodirafu/Home/i-miei-giochi/awkward" rel="nofollow">here you are</a>) for an enthusiastic, lovely gang of local and international larpers. My love to the organizers and all our wonderful players. Could there ever be higher praise than a player prefacing his debriefing discussion comment with <i>"I knew this was the best larp I'd ever played as soon as..."</i>? It's <i>you</i> who made it the best larp, guys!<br/>Perhaps the most amazing thing, though, was learning of the Latvian edition of <i>Fiasco</i>, from its adventurous publisher. Quite the thing to be proud of, <a href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">@Jason_Morningstar</a> !<br/><br/>On our way back, we killed some time while waiting for a late, late connecting flight playing some <i><a href="https://www.dreamlordpress.it/acquista/negozio/prodotto/microfiction-libro-pdf" rel="nofollow">Microfiction</a></i> - a game by Luca Bonisoli - set in the continuity of our ongoing <i>Leviathan Manifesto</i> series.                        </div>

We just played the second session today. It's an unpublished prototype me and Aviatrix are working on. The setting is based on John Harper's Breakers but we're trying out some different rules. It will probably stay unpublished but it's a good testing ground for some mechanics that aren't appropriate for my normal D&amp;D game — HSP stacey's is very solidly in the "impronitfol" corner of the RISS rectangle. We're doing a lot of Keith Johnstone style stuff. I'm experimenting with some Flaubert style work in that context. Also my character has swords. I hope it'll be a long campaign.<br/><br/>Aviatrix, hope you don't think I said too much.                        </div>

<b>Good Society</b> Online at the Gauntlet. Lizzie Brandon and Mr. Charles Croft exchange their own translations of Greek authors. Charles is acknowledged as heir by Lady Bertram. Archie fights a duel with Lizzie's brother-in-law James, his commanding officer. In the end Lizzie accepts Charles' proposal, but writes here sister that she thinks about dashing Major-General Archie Townshend. A wonderful game that we all really enjoyed!<br/><br/><b>Red Carnations on a Black Grave</b> Online at the Gauntlet. I started the day terrified I'd get a drop that would cause me to cancel, I ended up with a full table. We powered through to another shattering climax, a nice capper to another great month of online playtesting.<br/><br/><b>The Quiet Year</b> Every time I facilitated TQY I try to remind people to take the "quiet" part seriously. It seems that I should also talk a bit more about setting up rather than resolving :-| <br/><br/><b>hsp: stacey's diner</b> Can it be a love triangle if one side is (literally, maybe magickally) unbreakable? Why does the jar containing Jonas' remains radiate heat? How much do you need the color yellow? And whatever <i>did</i> happen to that guy doing the CBC documentary? (He's a weather guy in Toronto now, with a perfect record of predicting the weather.) <br/><br/><i>ETA: I forgot...</i><br/><br/><b>Masks: The New Generation</b>: Our Legacy's shtick is he's just another of the ice-based supers--every team has one, none of them do anything great. The Delinquent used to be in a supervillain gang. The Outsider is a...well, a Steven Universe Gem, and that's <i>amazing</i>. And my Nova is a Syrian refugee with the Carrie powerset plus telepathy. Things get messy fast. An awesome first session, and the first time I ever got to play for someone (JP from my Cthulhu games) who was maybe the first GM in my "lineage" <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            We have a small group that gathers every other Friday afternoon to play games, normally of my choosing since I normally run. After watching A:IW, I was in a supers mood. This is the group that roundly rejected <b>Masks: The New Generation</b>, so I dusted off the notes for the <b>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</b> game that we last played in December. We added a new recruit that I pulled in during the last Indie Game Day event at the FLGS. He's a super comics fan, so he was a great addition to the group.<br/><br/>One of my lamentations and M&amp;M and reasons I tried to sell the group on Masks was that I felt like the characters had no connections that were really relevant outside of their supers life, so it got to feeling a little like "supers skirmish time". Which can be fun, but I wanted something a bit more dramatic. I sort of got it this session by presenting them with a problem that their powers couldn't solve with a dice roll ("pressing the skill button" - or in this case, the power button.) <br/><br/>After a big brawl when an earthquake caused a prison break, one of the non-super villains used the distraction to create a hostage situation. One of the players started asking questions about the death penalty in the city's theoretical home state, which led to a bit of impromptu setting development. The new player (playing an Iron-man clone) used this tech resources to look up bits about the mobster's background he could exploit; I let his spend a hero point to specify relevant details. Between them, they role-played and got the mobster to surrender.                        </div>

                            The third session of <b>Tomb of Annihilation</b>, we have one player who's been a little grumpy about the logistics game, but... I loved this session so much. One of their main quest giving employer NPCs got <div class="Spoiler">eaten by a t-rex. He had been struck by blue mist so he was struggling against fleeing and finally the party just hid. They carried along with them another mist-strucken PC who they had had tied up and gagged. (He is a bard so kept vicious mockering them -- their subdual of him was an epic PvP fight where they did the last point of hit point with an unarmed strike. They were weaponless because he had lured them away from all of their gear. Players make the best villains.) The players are like "Is the game bugged now that our employer and quest-giver is dead? Is that path cut off?"<br/><br/>But... the truth is that this guy is like one of the minor side quests! He is like two sentences in the book! And he also told them his plan so they can still go there and do it themselves if they so wish.</div><br/><br/>I love that it's sooo emergent yet more driven by procedures than improvisation. So many interesting things happened. This is a dream campaign for me. For me there's a back and forth between the logistics game and the adventure game -- if a T-Rex eats your friend, who is going to carry the raincatchers?<br/><br/>This happens to be a jungle hex crawl but I imagine similar style games can happen underground or in space a la Traveller. Very much inspired by Paul's amazing ice moon story                        </div>

More of the above, except in the comfort of our own home on a Saturday night. Just one more episode, &lt;60 minutes of play. The constraints of the game system (despite it being <i>very</i> wide open and flexible in terms of initial setup) had us develop a side character to protagonist depth, in directions we wouldn't have anticipated. She now functions as a mirror of sorts to the main character, which is great.<br/><br/>One more session of SF <i>Sorcerer</i>, "The Mother-ships". In a stunning string of dramatic reversals, our reluctant heroes stopped a military coup by sheer manifest superiority (no actual shooting happened), struck a deal with the lame-duck president of Alpha Centauri to hand-wave away any previous accusations of mutiny, broadcast the truth to the whole world becoming hugely Internet-popular and came up with a sorcerous mad-science plan probably crazy enough to actually work. Aion even got his lover to finally say the words "I love you"! Which make sound like everything's fine and heroic and going to end well, but that's not how we feel, really. We know how hugely fucked up the whole situation is, and how there's no reasonable way for these characters to get a happy ending - that is, there's probably no way they could end up <i>happy</i>. Except by proxy, I mean: creating duplicates of themselves so that their v2.0 can eventually live a happy life - which Sander has already done, anyway. What could go wrong?<br/>Next session might be the last, or it might take a couple more, but we have this feeling we're close to an ending, and it will be <i>sad</i>.<br/><br/>Man, both of those ongoing games are emotionally exhausting, but we can't shut up about them when not playing...                        </div>

                            Various NPCs in the larp Musica Universalis. One was the archangel of sorrow, Cassiel. My sheet for them said (paraphrasing): Sad angel is sad. Humans probably want your token to retune the universe, which will make lots of humans die. Sad. Other alternative is apocalypse. Sad. Be sad at them. Ideally, they should get your token, unless they don't actually want it (which will make you sad, but that's all right). Don't make it too easy, obviously, and it's fine if you think they've legit failed to convince you -- you're the angel who couldn't bear to take sides during the war in heaven. Ideally, they convince you they understand the essential sadness of the universe, and bonus points if they cry.<br/><br/>So yes, I was sad at people. I listened and was sad. And they _got_ it. We were all sad together. Sad, sad, sad, and it was glorious. I mean, really, once folks understand who I'm playing, the ones who come over are going self select for "I want to be made to cry in this larp."<br/><br/>And one of them was sad that they were asking this of me. And one of them made an amazing speech about how important Cassiel was and thanked them -- and invited them to dinner. And later, token got handed over to the person I think everyone agreed should get it.<br/><br/>Now, retuning was a complicated process involving stuff I understood (the beings in the various slots would ring chimes and folks would sing their note, except for the beings in the Four Horsemen positions, who would NOT ring their chimes) and stuff I really, really didn't (like who went in what slot and sang what note and what it all meant and why) and really didn't have to understand. I went in knowing that they had more tokens than there were spaces in the ritual, so wouldn't use them all, and that they'd changed their minds a bajillion times at least (and, thankfully, were talked out of making the newly healed Archangel of Music the Rider of Pestilence). And I knew someone was explaining to them what happened with the unused tokens.<br/><br/>So I wasn't utterly surprised when Cassiel's token wasn't used. When game wrapped -- bang on the right note, literally -- I asked the player what that meant, metaphysically.<br/><br/>He explained that Cassiel and sorrow were still in the universe, just not built into the big blueprint diagram thingy, and that he had chosen not to use Cassiel's token because everyone kept trying to slot Cassiel into one of the four horsemen and he was adamant that he could NOT do that to Cassiel. So... yeah, to the degree one wins a larp, I call that a win.<br/> </div>

                            I’ve been playing a campaign of <b>Sorcerer</b> with <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>, <a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a>, and <a href="/forums/profile/Demiurge">@Demiurge</a>. David is doing an awesome job GMing a mysterious and surreal game with a lot of captivating, synchronistic surprises that peek the players’ curiosity—lots of “whoa, that’s awesome” moments. <br/><br/>I’ve also been GMing <b>The Sword, the Crown, and the Unspeakable Power</b> with the folks at Story Games SLC. It’s a really great PbtA game. I would highly recommend the game if your into GoT like themes. <br/><br/>I’m new to GMing and I think things are going relatively well. Having played a lot of collaborative GMless games, which have  similar roles to a GM’s role in them, has really helped with easing into the GM role; these games have lots of thinking-on-your-feet, improve like elements that really help you develop GM-like skills. I think playing these collaborative improve style games would even help more seasoned GMs hone their skills; especially if they are transitioning to games  that have a “play-to-find-out” style, in which the narrative is emeragant and not pre-planed.                         </div>

                            Heart of the Deernicorn in Olympia hosted Jason Morningstar this past week to run some games! I had the great pleasure of playing a few of them at this weekend's micro-con: Future Play! I got to play 4 games set in the world of Sirai--a planet embroiled in a drawn-out, complicated conflict.<br/><br/>First up was <b>Sirai</b>, which is a LARP -- I played the off-world military presence trying to defend interstellar commercial interests by maintaining the status quo on a city on the brink of war.<br/>Then I played <b>Thola</b> -- a table-top game set in the same world 50 years earlier. We were a small village struggling to survive under dueling factions.<br/>The next game was <b>The Line</b> -- a LARP where we were applying for refugee visas to leave Sirai. This game was so much fun and so emotionally distressing. I had to do some Bad Things to get on the right side of the line. <br/>Finally I got to play <b>Apportionment</b> -- a game where the future of Sirai was being negotiated by interstellar mediators and local forces. I got to play a surprisingly moderate religious leader. And yeah, things aren't looking too stable for the planet...<br/><br/>It was my first time really getting to know a world through multiple play experiences, and if you ever have a chance to do something like it, I highly recommend it. I have a hard time digesting large chunks of information about setting, and I definitely felt my fluency in the world increase over the weekend.<br/><br/>All of the games are analogs to real conflicts and horrible situations that people have and are facing. When I talked about the games with my co-worker this morning she was like, "dang. I would never think you could have that kind of experience with games." Yep. Games are amazing.                         </div>

<b>hsp stacey's</b> session four. A horrible session full of bleed that made me feel awful after. I hope this is a long campaign.<br/><br/><b>Tomb of Annihilation</b> session... five? losing track a bit. we have a new player so mostly rules explanation, doing level up etc. Some interesting things happened though. And they did manage to get back to port nyanzaru alive<br/><br/><b>Edit</b> turns out it was session four. It wasn't a good session, I was exhausted and unfocused and I'm not good at teaching D&amp;D                        </div>

<b>Pathfinder</b> - another session in my Scarred Lands campaign finds our epic-trending heroes in the fabled City of Brass. They are one of three factions in the city looking for an artifact. Lots in investigation (including once again squeezing PC-NPC interaction out of my player whose primary perspective on RPGs in Overwatch), only one throw-down.<br/><br/>I feel a little guilty looking forward. The current set up is basically they can't win. If they find the rod and stay in the city, the Efreeti Sultan will track them down and take it from them. If they leave, the goddess of shadows will show up and demand her artifact back. Though I understand that this is the way the campaign moves forward, still, from a GM standpoint, it feels wrong. I am looking for ways their decisions can eke more-bad or less-bad results out of the situation.                        </div>

                            I played a bizarre late-night two-player game of <i>The Quiet Year</i>. We didn't have much time, so we decided to play months instead of weeks (one card per month).<br/><br/>The fiction was dark and creepy and tragic. All the children in the village were buried alive by the end of the game, and other strange and disturbing things, as well. I finished the game, on one hand, really enjoying the fiction, and, on the other hand, feeling disturbed and unsettled in a very uncomfortable way. Playing felt spontaneous and unconscious.

<b>OSR campaign</b> - The bite of death does not seem as scary as the players paid for their first <i>raise dead</i> after the barber-surgeon had his fate shortened by a fortune telling skeleton. The same skeleton tells of a great fortune waiting at a certain spot in the dungeon.<br/><br/>The party finds the chamber. A large black door. Three cups, copper, silver and gold. A corpse lies before the golden cup. A voice booms "One cup opens the door, one cup leads to your death!" (do you know the answer to the riddle? my players did not).<br/><br/>After being frustrated at the slowness with which his collegues are solving the puzzle the 4th level thief swigs the final cup (after the other two had proved poisoned) and die instantly. After emptying the silver cup completely they find a key at the bottom of it. They open the door to find a 15' tall undead monstrosity which promptly slay the low level party members and henchmen and chase the others out of the dungeon (after being blinded with <i>Continual Light</i>).<br/><br/>To determine if the corpse of the thief stays I have rolled wandering monster checks, when cannibals or giant toads happen upon it it's gone. This is the third time in this dungeon the players remove a major obstacle (monster guard post, magic trap) and fail to capitalize on it and retreat letting other monsters claim the spoils. Of course, if they don't return to the black door (which indeed holds a great treasure) other monsters will claim it and transport it deeper into the dungeon.<br/><br/>Simulating the dungeon in this way is a fun way to figure out what happens when the status quo is disturbed by the players. Treasure, magic and information moves into the hands of another faction which in turn changes the political realities. Of course, the now roaming monstrosity itself changes the atmosphere of this dungeon section quite a bit.                        </div>

                            Krippler: what system are you using?<br/><br/>(BTW the monster checks to see if thief left I have done that too, that's a great technique)<br/><br/><b>Edit:</b> Thanks. Yeah, prof system is worst part of ACKS. Personally, I'm not sold on phase initiative (I don't like it when declaration and execution is separated) or the roll-under/crit-on-ten Pendragon style stuff (as you know, you have the same probabilities as ACKS, and maybe you have a player group who are more comfortable with rolling low). I love ACKS' attack throw system. But those aren't big deals. The "a gp is made of silver" thing I'm not sold on either, let us know if that ends up working fine or if that ends up confusing players. Thank you for sharing &amp; for putting your house rules out there. Nicely formatted, well done, I can tell you care a lot about your campaign.                        </div>

                            Thanks Paul! It's definitely a work in progress. Something I'm happy with is the ruling on fighting in ranks. The 2nd rank don't get to pick their target in the melee and they are more vulnerable to enemy missiles than the first rank as there is no risk of friendly fire. Height also matters, archers are more useful fighting tall enemies than short ones.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> you don't separate declaration and execution in my initiative system, except for when casting spells (so people have a chance to interrupt the mage with arrows or get out of the way, otherwise a 1st level mage with <i>Sleep</i> could smoke a lot of parties, I see them as artillery and thus not trivial to deploy).<br/><br/>Example of play:<br/><br/>1. No morale roll (nobody has died yet)<br/>2. DM: "Anyone casting?" PC1: "Yes, I'm casting <i>Black Sleep</i>."<br/>3. DM: "Alright short movement." People move their characters. I move the monsters.<br/>4. DM: "Their commanders shouts and points at the mage, the archers focus their shots. What do you do in the ranged phase?" P2: "I shoot the closest archer." P3: "I shoot the same guy." DM: "Alright, roll for it... seems everyone missed. The enemy arrows bounce off of the mage's shield."<br/>5. DM: "Roll your armor to see if the spell goes off, 5+ on D20... alright roll to see how many go to sleep." PC1: "Four, I pick those in melee." DM: "Alright they are all down and out."<br/>6. DM: "Long movement." PC4: "I charge the archers past the sleeping spearmen."<br/>7. DM: "Alright roll attack, you have +2 to hit." PC4: "I don't like this roll in the middle stuff, I can never tell if I did good." DM: "It's easier for me to compare numbers than subtract, especially in mixed groups and you did hit, roll damage. The archers don't get to hit you this round as they already shot."<br/>1. Rolls morale. "You see the pigmen starting to withdraw, but with their weapons ready."<br/><br/>The gps are actually silver is slightly confusing but it just irks me too much when there is a disconnect between the value of golden treasure and the weight of gold pieces are too mismatched. Platinum currency is just silly, as people discovered when they were introduced IRL. My players have gotten used to it, and I usually say "gp" or "sp" out loud if they find any.                        </div>

                            Oh a little like The One Ring, except every round, yeah I see how that can work very well. Sorry for jumping to the conclusion that it was some sorta declare-then-sort thing.<br/><br/>The silver standard thing is a bit setting dependent but I think <a href="http://autarch.co/comment/6701#comment-6701" rel="nofollow">Alex explains it best here</a>. That's for fantasy England and medieval Europe. In al-Qadim, a gp also match well up to a historical gold dinar in both market value and weight, and an sp to a silver dirham. I.e. same standard, they just were more likely to actually have 1 GP than to have 10 SP.<br/><br/>1e and B/X has 10 coins weigh one pound (which is why Delta and LotFP want to use the silver standard),<br/>5e has 50 coins weigh one pound,<br/>and ACKS has 100 coins weigh one pound. <small>5e's econ and prices overall matches well up to ACKS (with one big difference: wealth-by-level is around 5 times higher in ACKS).</small><br/><br/>If you want to continue this in a new thread, I'll be there (these "What did you play this week" threads are pretty singular in purpose but I was really happy to be able to read some of your house rules).                        </div>

                            No. Only Arthur is a PC. But all the other players were attuned to victorian gentlemen and ladies and then Arthur turned out to be a weak, petted aristocrat´s son, unwilling to abandon his position as the most desired bachelor of London...:<br/><br/>"Allright, Lucy was a real cool conquest... but now she is turning into a vampire, and I`m expected to take to her bed? No - not with me! Think about my families reputation! Think about all the other girls better suited to marry befitting the rank of my family! Saving Lucy? There´d be no quiet sleep for me - I´d always think of the monster, that could be slumbering in her inside. I need a strong whiskey!"<br/><br/>No times for heroes...

                            Monthly <b>Masks</b>. Short version, the team eliminated the closest thing my setting has to Superman. Long version - Opal is a super powerful hero that was essentially a captured alien intelligence that Rook Industries (ye old sinister corporation) found and developed technology to more or less "involuntarily program". A villain who figured that out tried to hijack Rook's control of Opal. After both Rook's and the villain's control of Opal slipped, Opal went berserk. Evan Horizon (the team's gravity-powered nova) figured out that the creature doesn't mean to hurt things, it just doesn't understand our world without the Rook programming in place. I gave him the choice of either re-establishing the control of Opal or working with it to return it to its otherworldly home, and Evan chose the latter.<br/><br/>Out of game (meta-game, I guess), a hot topic of conversation at the table was the impact that different PCs taking moves from different playbooks would have on the characters in-game.<br/><br/>My daughter plays with us. On the way home, she is quizzing me about different NPCs her character knows. I talk to her a bit about what has been established in the game about them. She says "I just like thinking about the characters."<br/><br/>I'm like "that's one of the joys of roleplaying games."                        </div>

                            Played a few <b>Love &amp; Darkness</b> with my 12-year-old students. They are still very good at blocking each other ideas, but it's slowly getting better.<br/><br/>Finally tried out <b>Annalise</b> with a baroque setting in Vienna. I was more interested in a Dangerous Liaisons game but the other players shifted the theme toward religious topics. I loved the <i>claims</i> and the concept of <i>satellite traits</i>, but I felt that the dicey things are getting in the way of the story. When playing for drama and catharsis I'm biased toward Fiasco-light procedures.<br/><br/>BTW the use of <b>Otherkind dice</b> gave me inspiration so I playtested my 'fantasy HR' game idea called <b>Vassals &amp; Intrigue</b>.

<b>OSR Campaign</b> the party returns to the dungeon to retrieve the bodies of their comrades, and the huge treasure that was foretold. They find the bodies gone and the treasure stolen. They find an oracular statue which tells them the best way to the treasure and the bodies of their comrades. And the identity of the Sunday Slayer, a serial killer they've had a run in with months earlier. The oracular statue says it's the current emperor of Japan!<br/><br/>They follow their map, but find a stone door that was opened by monsters for them earlier is now closed. Taking a slight detour a bridge collapses and the mage falls into a moat of grimy death soup, he is beset by rotgrubs (worms that enter your skin and crawl to your heart)!<br/><br/>Due to <i>Continual Light</i> nobody has brought no torches, the crude but traditional remedy. The mage has prepared eye-lasers though to fight the gigantic undead monster they unleashed the last time. His comrades have cantrip strength versions of the eye-lasers and they manage to blast 6/7 rot grubs nearly killing the mage in the process. <br/><br/>He has 2 hit points left. He takes his knife and attempt to catch the final grub as it has made its way to his armpit. The player argues that it should be an automatic hit to stab a worm. I having real world experience drawing blood (which in essence is trying to pierce a worm under the skin without doing too much damage) rule no, this is a Dex-check. <br/><br/>The mage fails his roll and accepts his fate. He cleans out his wounds with water to recover a few hit points, perhaps useful in the 1d3 turns he's got left to live. Then he comes up with a gambit. He knows <i>Black Sleep</i> which is a half-strength version of sleep that lasts for a full day. By casting it on himself he might be able to nail the grub as well. I think this is sound reasoning as it's part of his body (although I don't say this to the players) and they retreat carrying the comatose mage back to the surface and the nearest shrine for some serious de-worming.<br/><br/>tl;dr: poor map reading and bad luck almost does the party in, but clever play saves the life of the mage and clever questioning of an orcaular statue (seemingly) solves a murder mystery from months ago                        </div>

                            As our Saturday night game, my girlfriend and I started playing <i><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/234653/Dead-Friend-A-Game-of-Necromancy" rel="nofollow">Dead Friend</a></i> by <a href="/forums/profile/oh_theogony">@oh_theogony</a> Lucian Kahn. We chose to set it in the same world as our (currently abandoned) long game of <i>Freebooting Venus</i> by <a href="/forums/profile/lumpley">@lumpley</a> Vincent Baker, which used to focus a lot on the machinations of necromancers and murderers-for-hire in the criminal underworld of a wealthy city-state -- but we aren't reusing any known characters, just the setting.<br/>The friends are house guards for one of the cities' noble families - a licensed necromancer who seems to entertain shady dealings with a powerful drug cartel, possibly in her employers' name, and a (now deceased) swordsman who's always been in love with the youngest daughter of the house, promised to a country bumpkin of a moneylender's son. Main motivation: Justice (revenge vs. just rest in peace).<br/>We're about halfway through the game, we think, and about to learn what killed our poor swordsman (not that there aren't several obvious options). I'm liking it a lot.<br/><br/>And on Sunday afternoon I've been running <i>Sorcerer</i>, of course - our ongoing "Mother-ships" campaign.<br/>We finally managed to articulate this very simple realization: as long as the sorcerers keep listening to the NPCs and - basically - running errands for them, none of the setting's underlying conflicts will resolve. That's because the whole anthroposphere is a mess of a universe where everybody is confused about priorities, partly because they lack information and partly 'cause they're, well, <i>human</i> - so NPCs can't figure out solutions to their own problems and will just keep escalating them out of proportion! The only way sorcery can be employed to actually fix things is to take bold lateral leaps (as Sander Cross did when he rewrote the social system of planet Orrakachu by banishing the Oracle Stone, I guess).<br/>That's why Aion is now thinking of transplanting alien life-forms from a newly discovered planet to the home world of the Centaurian Federation, as a possible replacement to the increasingly dangerous Space Station Yggdrasil... Well, that's complicated.<br/>Oh, have I mentioned Sander Cross is sitting on a piece of technology that would change everything for everyone forever? A transmitter/receiver everybody can supposedly use that just bypasses the speed of light and communicates at the speed of thought, no distance limit. He's been sitting on it for two sessions straight but hasn't been able to boot it up yet, being too busy trying to deal with the political turmoil in Alpha Centauri (as usual).                        </div>

                            Sunday: Character creation for Dracula Dossier 1977, along with discussing how one does the Le Carre tone when there's vampires and how we're voiding the warranty by how we're tweaking things. And I'm trying to figure out what happened to one of the character sheets -- player and I both remember him handing it to me, and yet, I cannot find it.<br/><br/>Thursday: Our Ladies of Sorrow, a non-mythos Call of Cthulhu game set around 2009 that we're doing as Trail of Cthulhu set, at least to begin with, in 1963 Greenwich Village. I prepped and prepped, and this was not overprep even when I mentally registered that we were not going to get terribly far into things because stuff came up from all angles. Mind, the most useful bit of my prep was my plotting points on a Google map, making it Plain Atlas style, and printing it out at several different scales. I don't have a ton of game quotes written down and... rather a lot of what made the game click was as much visual as audio. I don't know how to transcribe the looks people gave each other.<br/><br/>We tried to figure out 1963 medical logic to wake up one of the PCs, and Aviatrix explained that there were basically two drugs that were used a heck of a lot -- Speed and Valium.<br/><br/>Joyce: You have Speed. Come on, you're used to it.<br/><br/>Martin (who, unfortunately, is): Oh, is _that_ why?<br/><br/>Isidore (the actual medical professional): Should I give you half a Valium?<br/><br/>Martin: Yes, please.<br/><br/>And... so, Joyce, Martin, and Jeremiah have dealt with the mythos before, and Martin's picked up a bit of magic. Isidore not so much and was convinced that minor -- weird, sure -- things were just coincidental, and certainly not folklore coming to life. So... folks decided to show him.<br/><br/>And, I pointed out that anything subtle, well, anything subtle could be a coincidence, right?<br/><br/>So Martin created a hyperspace portal from the apartment they were in (on Sixth Avenue (yeah, I know the rest of the world spells that Avenue of the Americas)) to the bar Joyce ran (on Carmine Street, about four small blocks away, and take him through. (Hey, at least the gate got cleaned up this time, rather than, oh, I don't know, letting an interdimensional traveler in again...)<br/><br/>I mean, yeah, there's a plot and all, but there's also four people, all dented by the world and trying to cope, and it's amazing to watch.                        </div>

"Our Lady of Sorrows" I´m planning to convert and blend in my "Unto the fourth Generation" campaign. The Ladies will be the brides of Dracula.<br/><br/>Because it was so nice to read about your intents, I did research about your roleplaying presence on internet.

                            I played in a *very silly* game of <b>Follow</b> at Story Games Olympia. We wanted to be wrestlers--and between the playsets "The Championship" and "The Show", we obviously went for "The Show". It was total amateur hour and it was amazing. Our first challenge was to create a catchy musical number--which is where things really started getting ridiculous. It's hard to say who was a better singer/wrestler: My Feral Lady ("the rain in Spain lands mainly on your face! *pile-drive*) or Slamdy (ya know... from Grease??). There were a lot of ribbons in the costuming. <br/><br/>And the scene where visionary wrestler (my minor character) The Slamerillion gives emotional advice to a shy, fellow wrestler all through Tolkien metaphors? I'm just saying I may have to give up role-playing after that. I've done all I can. <br/><br/>I'm sorry to say that we lost the last challenge, and thus the quest. Very bad musical wrestling was not a hit somehow? Don't ask me.                        </div>

Thank you. I'm very flattered -- I hope you like Digger.<br/>Let me know if you have trouble finding my Dracula Dossier write ups. While I'm behind in them, I did put the ones I've completed on my wiki.<br/><br/> </div>

                            Return to my <b>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</b> game. Part two of the third party adventure <i>Disaster Day</i>. Towards the end, it was looking like a dungeon crawl against <del>Hydra</del> <i>The Horde</i>. Which actually went better than it might sound. The party's resident Batman clone, who spends may of the big fights in the shadows of the bruisers in the party, actually mopped up here pretty well.<br/><br/>I tried cross-pollinating the session with some of the techniques I normally use/learned in <b>Masks</b>, with mixed results. When they successfully took out an opponent, I let them describe how that went down. Two of the players really relished this, but the third seemed uncomfortable being put on the spot.                        </div>

                            For this month's Indie Game Day at the FLGS, I went old school, and ran <b>Traveller</b> (Mongoose 1e). I have a little "one shot kit" I use for Traveller, in which I let the players bounce around and do everything sandbox, and throw short encounters and patrons at them as they try to make a buck. This time around, one of the players mentioned they had a contact that was a hunter and asked if he was on world and I said "of course he is." And I extrapolated a whole adventure around the contact going missing because he was abducted by a Solomani spy.<br/><br/>Today was a good day for my improv game.                        </div>

                            After doing setup a couple of weeks ago we played the Pilot episode of our <b>Prime Time Adventures 3e</b> game tonight.  It was interesting to see a conflict mechanic that could make both participants in a conflict fail, it's not something I see every day.  In general the game felt a bit rushed when every single scene had to be about a conflict and the resolution of that conflict. Still, we'll carry on with Episode 2 next week, perhaps the game will grow on me.<br/><br/>The <b>OKULT</b> play by post is slowly progressing through prep.  Perhaps a bit too slowly, we'll see if it fades away or we reach the first scene.                        </div>

                            On Saturday, we played the second half of our <i>Freebooting Venus</i> spinoff-themed game of <i><b>Dead Friend</b></i> (by Lucian <a href="/forums/profile/oh_theogony">@oh_theogony</a> Kahn). It was pretty good. One of those sort-of difficult games where you have <i>a lot</i> of prompts and your main task as a player is keeping it all reasonably coherent instead of all over the place (blank page was never an issue, but analysis-paralysis came up a few times). Granted, some of my favorite games fall into that camp, and <i>Dead Friend</i> is better than average at the very least. <i>Great</i> use of ritual to set the mood, too. I really, really recommend you all give it a try!<br/><br/>On Sunday, a <i><b>Sorcerer</b></i> session, in the "Motherships" weird-SF campaign. This was a very low-energy session, despite a couple really significant plot developments. I blame my sucky spotlight-moving and dramatic coincidence-staging skills as a GM (MCing AW comes natural to me, while GMing Sorcerer doesn't, just like playing as producer in PTA was never my strong suit). I'd really need to stitch together a GM-less hack of Sorcerer (something more Polaris-like) in order to appreciate it fully! We agreed next Sunday will be the final session, whatever happens, as the original kickers have long busted into a number of ongoing conflicts, but we can't reasonably expect <i>all</i> loose threads to resolve: whatever we get to next session, that will be our new status quo.<br/><br/>On Wednesday, the long overdue final half of a game of <i><b>On Mighty Thews</b></i> - by <a href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">@Simon_C</a> - we'd started a while ago (had RL issues meeting up). The heroes led an uprising in a sorcerer-controlled city state, culminating in a glorious attempt at a <i>coup d'etat</i> in a crowded theater and a cinematic confrontation with the reclusive sorcerer in his hideout. Players visibly achieved mastery of the system throughout play. OMT keeps amazing me. <b>EDITED TO ADD</b>: it keeps amazing me because, as a fine-tuned set of tools, it's just really good at dividing up the tasks of making up a story and making up a setting between everybody in ways that don't feel like we're just taking turns doing it. I confirm my impression that 3 players (including the GM) is the best number of players for this.                        </div>

                            Ran more <b>Starfinder</b>. Still don't love it, still making peace with running it by making it my own.<br/><br/>Since we had players drop because they are moving or changing work schedules, I have been having trouble pulling together enough people to play every week. The FLGS owner offered to advertise it as an event for the store. I conditionally said yes (I'm more about gaming with friends, and didn't want to full-on embrace the Organized Play "anyone can play who brings a character sheet" model.)<br/><br/>That was opening the floodgates. I went from 3 to 7 players like that. Of the four new players, we ended up with<br/>- A couple, obviously super invested in the game, tended to dominate play.<br/>- A father-and-son, new to the game, a bit timid in play.<br/><br/>I wrote in the new players by hmaking up a pair of flavorful NPCs to give them a ride. I planned to write off by having the players receive a tragic distress signal when they depart. But they were interesting enough, I may give the players a chance to save them.                        </div>

                            Played <b>The Serpent's Tooth</b> last night with the folks from my AW game.<br/><br/>It was a strange mix of hilarious and comical and dark and creepy. There was a giant snake with a man's arm instead of a tongue, a gods-cursed bird-woman, and all kinds of other shenanigans.<br/><br/>My fellow player took my suggested character - a dim-witted Beholder named Beelzebub - and played her to the hilt, trying to learn how to "be human" to hilarious results.<br/><br/>An interesting and highly freeform game. Not sure what would happen if the players tried to play competitively, as the text seems to hint at, since the narrative is basically freeform collaboration (aside from the strictures of scene framing).                         </div>

                            We played a very fine older Ars Magica 4th edition adventure: "By the law of the land", contained in the sourcebook "Ordo Nobilis". It´s an adventure about a medieval selling of an estate, a potential healing well included. It has an Intro and a showdown. For the middlesection there are 7 days available and some NPC´s descriptions, that vastly was it. Adventure, our improvising and the time frame matched very good together... and all that without one combat or spell.                        </div>

                            Yesterday, we conducted a Frankenstein PbtA experiment: we each picked two moves from different PbtA games and threw them together in the melting pot to see what kind of game they suggested. The moves could be from anywhere in each game, so basic, peripheral or playbook, but the concept required that they all be treated as basic moves for our game.<br/><br/>We ended up with moves from Dungeon World, Velvet Glove, Apocalypse World and Masks, among others: the combination of these lead us to create a setting about magical female spies for a fantasy kingdom who went into situations to prevent wars and other conflicts from breaking out! It was epic and fun and we even got a serious story out of it in which our characters judged and executed a young noble.                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">@Hopeless_Wanderer</a> It briefly gave me the urge to compile an encyclopedia of PbtA moves and pack it with rules for the 'create your own unique game &amp; setting' our MC presented us with.<br/><br/>Some of the inspiration came from <a href="http://ageofravens.blogspot.co.uk/2016/05/crowsmantle-and-eagle-cloaks-owl-capes.html" rel="nofollow">Crowsmantle</a>, which encourages players to collaborate in creating entirely new moves and other mechanics for the game; our MC for that just thought "Hey, you could just use existing moves from other games," and it snowballed from there.<br/><br/> </div>

                            Our bi-weekly Torchbearer saga continues.  The party made a shaky peace with a Dire Wolf, which made our Magician MVP for casting a spell to speak its language.  When the dire wolf finds out that same magician killed its beloved?  Then things might not look so sunny.<br/><br/>Players were so strategic this session, which was satisfying.  They knew a goblin warband was coming, so they made bombs and built traps.  They went 18 turns without camping, which is a record for this new campaign.  As a GM, I focused on using interesting twits to maintain momentum, rather than bombarding them with conditions.  When they plopped down in base camp hungry and exhausted from the grind, those conditions felt <i>earned.</i> </div>

                            A new session of my 'fantasy HR campagin' playtest with Otherkind Dice. It's about lieges and vassals, and players administer an increasing number of characters. It was mainly inspired by the game Lords of Midnight and maybe Heroes II &amp; III too. I love that in one hour we completed a full quest. The game works smoothly in Theather of the Mind style, but I want to do it with a gradually detailed map.                        </div>

                            I played session <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> of my Urban Shadows campaign in Miami.<br/>The Vampire was in meditation mode, due to the absence of the player. The Aware, the Wolf and the Tainted got to save the Glades University Campus (territory of the Wolf) from a fiery ghost who set fire to buildings (and people), and was rallying peaceful ghosts and turning them into burning violent ghost. Cause the Campus is home to old haitian ghosts ...<br/><br/>It was great, missed rolls lead to great scenes. Clocks have advanced, and they learned that the fire burns. Met a hunter family too.                         </div>

                            Session 25 (?) of the open table, old school sandbox adventuring game I run. (Mostly Holmes+Torchbearer, genealogically.)<br/><br/>We had one totally new player, one new player who has enthusiastically joined after playing with us during the local monthly D&amp;D meetup, two irregulars returning for their first session in a couple months, and four regulars--in other words, we hit venue capacity.<br/><br/>The group chose a hook that had been sitting there without articulation since October, and one that (naturally) I hadn't developed beyond the bare text of the hook: a Pearl Sea Company colony was suffering thunderbeast (fantasy dinosaur) attacks and would pay for extermination. By the end of the session, it was discovered that the dinosaurs were initially pacifists living in harmony with native human (reptile-) cultists, but had been decimated by a wasting disease brought by the colonists, who had shrugged and tried to eradicate the natives. The cultists then ensorcelled the remaining dinos (with their consent), driving them mad, but increasing their combat abilities in a last ditch play for revenge.<br/><br/>Also, the party totally wrecked the port and colony and stole most of the colonists' goods, and look likely to ally with the native cultists to stage an "accident" that ends the colony for good.<br/><br/>Much fun was had. I suspect that they'll return to the dino hook and finish it on Friday.                        </div>

                            So... Sunday, I'm running 1977 Dracula Dossier, the players having requested a very short but intense game. Monday, I'm running Kerberos Club: Machinery of Life, with Atomic Robo rules (hacked a bit), and the players have voted to remake the government of Promethea (from Dark Harvest). Wednesday, I'm running Our Ladies of Sorrow, with Trail of Cthulhu rules supplemented by some of the lovely parts of Fall of Delta Green.<br/><br/>That means this week, I'm frantically prepping for three radically different games.<br/>And I'm juggling a couple of tasty editing projects.<br/><br/>So, naturally, I've also volunteered to playtest the beta Fate of Cthulhu (and we only just realized email to me about that hadn't reached me, so I'm already a couple of weeks behind) and Solo Ops for Night's Black Agents.<br/> </div>

                            Saturday: <b>Pathfinder</b> - While assaulting the Shining Pyramid of Set (in the City of Brass), the tanks are out this session, the rogue tanks, with predictable results. The party dips into their hero points to narrowly avoid a TPK. They regroup and manage to renew their assault and get the clues they really need to find their macguffin of the moment, the Rod of Souls.<br/><br/>Thursday: <b>Starfinder</b>. Still don't love it, but I'm learning to use it a bit better, and am personalizing bits of the game to work better with the PCs backstory. Still, I did a little foreshadowing (let the xenodruid know about the remaining megafauna on an otherwise undead planet), the party took it for a hook, and I had to not-so-gently redirect them.                        </div>

                            I started to participate in games on rolegate.com. I'm not really into pbp gaming but Ive realized that the rules of Sw/oM work perfectly there. They actually turn the 'bugs' and obstacles of the format into gameplay supporting features. It is <i>really</i> a 'fiction emulator' rpg.<br/><br/>Other IRL cool procedures (stake setting in Otherkind, devils bargains in BitD) dont really work well in pbp.<br/><br/>Interestingly one of the most successful game I participate is a DW hack. I think this is partly due to the fact that we are an international group. We have participant in the US, Europe and East Asia which means that the posts are equally distributed thu the day, there is a nice flow to the story and you cannot add meaninfully to the story more than once a day. So the ratio of participation is structurally  balanced!                          </div>

                            Bi-weekly Torchbearer session.<br/><br/>The company <i>almost</i> has control of fort Valborg (which the halfling Finfargle has dubbed 'Finfargleton') except for the Hagbui, a hungry ghost, wandering its grounds.  The party made the most of their daylight, pouring lamp oil into a pit trap and covering it with thatch.  Finfargle sought to lure the beast out with smoked squirrel, then used himself as bait by balancing on a beam spanning the pit.<br/><br/>Finfargle lept out of the way as the Hagbui neared but the creature pulled Karolina into the pit with it.  Our elf, Erlander, lept into the pit with both of them, ready to set his dagger into the back of the shambling spirit.  The magician won the ensuing combat handily by summoning a swarm of aetherial hornets to tear the ghost to pieces.<br/><br/>As the slime of the Hagbui rose and filled the pit, Erlander and Karolina scrambled desperately to escape.  When they cleared the ladder, they saw another mercenary company at the gates.  There was some posturing at a potential fight over the fort, but our magician and cleric were able to talk this other party into taking a hike (with help from a delicately placed blade by our unscrupulous halfling).  Karolina ran up to the main hall of the fort to ensure that Hannah, a girl they had rescued, was ok.  She wasn't fast enough, and she made it just in time to see Hannah getting dragged off by a member of this other company.<br/><br/>Now the party has to decide whether to go back to the capital to claim their reward for taking the fort, or go off into the woods after Hannah (knowing that other mercenary companies are after their claim).  This is my favorite kind of Torchbearer moment: the party looking over their rations, conditions, and loot and asking each other "Can we afford to do the right thing?" and for some of them "Will we do it anyway?"<br/> </div>

                            Looks like I've let myself fall behind on this thread...<br/><br/>Two Sundays ago (not counting today - so that's been 2 full weeks already!) two Sundays ago we did in fact finish our SF <i>Sorcerer</i> game, called "The Mother-ships". Despite some of the sessions having been meandering and off-focus, the ending was spot on, totally re-focused on the main characters making big, irrevocable decisions about issues emerging directly from the intersection between their respective Kickers and sorcerous quirks (Price+demonic Needs). I believe scheduling for the game to end was indeed an important factor in achieving that.<br/>Theirs were choices of self-sacrifice, though not in the most obvious, suicidal sense: selflessly putting the needs of <i>others</i> and one's own <i>integrity</i> above one's desires, happiness and even identity. Interesting short-circuit of Humanity, where the least human<i>-like</i> choice was also the most <i>humane</i> most of the time, and the humanity of <i>others</i> was several times preserved at effectively the cost of <i>the Sorcerers' own</i>.<br/>Barbara, playing Aion, surprised us by breaking out actual <i>goodbye letters</i> she'd written - as Aion - to various characters in the game (PC-player preparing for the session much more than the GM did: check)! We all cried.<br/><br/>Then on Wednesday evening (that is, Wednesday last week, as in 2 Wednesdays ago) we just did some prep-work for our 2-player <i>Leviathan Manifesto</i> + other games campaign. Yeah, it <i>has</i> grown so big and thick with unfinished plots that we actually felt the need to review them in order to plan for the next case! That's quite impressive, in terms of sheer size and complexity.                        </div>

                            We officially declared the OKULT game dead this week. Sad to see it go, but better it die now than later when we have invested deeper.<br/>From the ashes rises a new group with mostly the same players. We'll play Until Dawn, and are making characters now. I'll play Sam who wants to be a rock star. <br/><br/>Also, I'm in a Burning Empires PbP. We're through world burning, and to varying degrees done with character burning as well, we might see some tentative prologue color scenes later today. <br/><br/>But I see some of my fellow players struggle under the weight of the rules. I wonder if it isn't actually the rules text as such, rather than the mechanics explained therein. There's something about the prose in the BE book that makes learning it a hard task to me. <br/><br/>At first I thought it was the format of the book, so I tried changing the layout to US letter. But it wasn't it. <br/><br/>I wonder if a condensed text couldn't cover all the relevant material in 30 pages or so. <br/><br/>For now I'll hope that the stragglers pull through, because I quite like the setup we have so far. <br/> </div>

Thanks. Might be worth a post-mortem on this particular game, considering the problems we had during several sessions going on... The main take away point, however, is reiterating <i><b>I</b></i> personally need to rely quite a lot on OOC, "meta" communication for a game to work well - when I try to "just play my character" and step down from everything else I don't perform as well, and when I try to "just be a GM" it's a potential disaster because, as a "GM", my impact on the quality of the game is multiplied several times. The more "meta-level" issues tend to be explicitly spoken of as <i>meta</i>, the easier time I have dealing with them - which in turn is key in my improved performance in and enjoyment of RPGs over the years.                        </div>

                            Sunday: Dracula Dossier 1977, which... seems to have gone astonishingly well. Unsure if the second session will go as well, especially as it needs to wrap things.<br/><br/>Monday: Kerberos Fate: Machinery of Life: I misjudged tone, so we paused to figure out how to get things back on track without breaking anyone (of the players), which seems to have worked, as we were then back in the zone that has the overlap of zany and philosophical. Folks need to decide where the PCs head next, which will hopefully be somewhere I can fake well enough.                        </div>

                            A bunch of stuff in the last few weeks:<br/><br/><b>Apocalypse World 2e</b>: The new Hocus is basically running an anime themed nightclub. The Brainer is still trying to revive the "Murder Everybody" cult. My hardholder asked the Angel to draft a constitution (and the player immediately obliged.) She also killed one of her lieutenants (and I took the resulting advance to cross off Savage from the gangs tags.) Next time I plan to start knighting people to live up to the settlement's name of Kamlann.<br/><br/><b>Escape from Marseilles</b>, a short LARP about getting refuges out of Marseilles in 1940.<br/><br/><b>Lovecraftesque</b> using Elsa Henry's playset. Not as scary as previous runs, but did feature an appearance by Nyarlathotep.<br/><br/><b>Fiasco</b> using the Boomtown playset. The mail-order Chinese bride and the sheriff were ex-criminals trying to run last scam; my lady deputy and the groom were ex-Mormons trying to make a new life. We managed to get a showdown and a couple of hangings in during a very enjoyable little game.<br/><br/><b>Masks</b>: the team continued to spiral apart as the Outsider brought the football captain as her date to the Delinquent's "I just got out of jail!" party. My Nova wrecked his car, then proceeded to use her psychic powers to manipulate the Homecoming voting so that the Legacy and the Outsider won. Then the Legacy came out to her as asexual. We wrapped up with another attack from Blackout, the villain quickly becoming our personal nemesis.<br/><br/><b>Night's Black Agents</b>: Dracula Dossier 1977. "I suppose you want me for this case because I used to work for the Competition. As it turns out I'm running a Romanian asset out of their embassy currently so that will help. At the Circus we're all concerned that the Cousins don't get too much wind of this--it will be another Philby. As for me, this op is my ticket to being DCS in Berlin or maybe Chief of Station elsewhere. And also, when <i>George Smiley</i> comes to your desk to talk to you, you damn well listen!" The LeCarrean slang flew fast and furious as the immortal(?) disgraced former head of Edom put together a team including my MI6 officer, a photographer and Edom asset, and a vampiric David Bowie groupie to embark on a mole hunt.<br/><br/><b>Trail of Cthulhu</b> Our Ladies of Sorrow. Creepy children, a protege making out with another PCs girlfriend, hauntings, creepy children, Thomas DeQuincey, and a hootenanny with Phil Ochs, Woody's kid, and oh yeah Bob dropped in at the end of the night: Joyce is having a busy holiday weekend. Fortunately most of her bar's clientele will be out on Fire Island for the weekend.                        </div>

                            Still way behind on reporting...<br/><br/>Two weekends ago I was at a nice little cozy gamers' meet-up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neumarkt,_South_Tyrol" rel="nofollow">Egna/Neumarkt</a> where some people played board-games and I ran perhaps half of the role-playing games on offer - i.e. two of them. I had plans of running several shorter games, at least 4 over two days, also to give a friend who was new to it a taste of the huge variety of indie RPGs. As we all know well, no plan survives contact with the players.<br/><br/>I spent my Saturday running <i>On Mighty Thews</i> (hi, <a href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">@Simon_C</a> !) for two wonderful, imaginative, dedicated players. I insist three people <i>is</i> the sweet spot for this game, hands down. It got <i>long</i> - over 12 hours minus meal breaks, so probably about 8 hours overall - and it was <i>damn good</i>, definitely my best game of OMT ever (and I've played a lot!).<br/>(That was while my first-timer friend played <i>A Taste for Murder</i> + several board-games and apparently had a lot of fun, for which I'm glad.)<br/><br/>On Sunday, before I had to run away in the late afternoon, I ran <a href="http://lumpley.com/index.php/anyway/thread/462" rel="nofollow">Rock of Tahamaat</a> - which is actually a fun and complete game that should see more play. There were 4 non-Rock players, thus 6 people overall, and we managed to play to full rounds, but would definitely have played a third had we had the time. The Rock player was... quite impressive. Half the non-Rock scenes felt like <i>Fiasco</i> in space, which is a good thing in my book, but there was quite some variety, as one player got involved in paranoid covert counter-assassination schemes and another in a heroic, tragic tale of armed resistance. We actually regret the Rock's intents didn't go awry more often: it was recommended to me - and I would genuinely consider when playing again - to raise the target numbers for successfully carrying out the Rock's intents by a point or two, in order to make the game wackier.<br/> </div>

                            It took almost a week, but now three out of four players in the Burning Empires game have started their prologues. It feels great to have gotten started. With some luck I'll be playing my space princess PC for the next 6 to 12 months.<br/><br/>The Until Dawn game is steaming ahead as well. We're deep into the flashback scene following the opening scene.                         </div>

                            Session 12 in <b>Tomb of Annihilation</b>. The first eight sessions: no PC deaths. Session 9, 11 and 12: heartbreaking PC deaths. But... we're in the same part of the book, same encounter table etc. (They have made brief forays into the harder tables but most of the deaths have been in the "starting" table.) It's just unlucky die rolls etc. But some of these encounters really suck. 3d6 velociraptors burst out and get advantage on their stealth roll to determine surprise. Have some coffee.<br/><br/>Today we were a smaller group, so we were mellowing out, rolling on every single xanathars &amp; mordekainens backstory table, discussing builds, finally coming to an agreement to houserule eldritch blast multiclassing, eating gyoza. And then after like four or five hours of this sort of out-of-session fun, we started playing. Some interesting exploration of Port Nyanzaru but then brutal death in the jungle. And death in the form of "hi the party takes 24 attacks out of the blue! with advantage". Ugh. Not fun. I loved the PC, an eladrin. We had rolled up different personality traits for each season. And a rando backstory where the eladrin had been raised as a changeling among wood elves until their wild magic (chaos sorcerer) powers and season changing burst out jean grey style in their teens. But dead now. It was a day of really letting char gen, gear shopping, spell selection and chitchat take time — pleasant time — that ended on a downer note.<br/><br/>Looking up the CR for the raptors it says that it would've been a fair fight for a party of four level fours. Which my players disputed and I shrugged. Like, IDK. They have multiattack and pack tactics. They seem more glass cannonny than wolves.<br/><br/>I proposed that we gave up on ToA but they decided (perhaps they'll feel differently after sleeping on it) to soldier on. Get more henches.<br/><br/> </div>

                            Free RPG day gives us another trifecta gaming week.<br/><br/>Thursday <b>Starfinder</b>. I am running the published adventure path. I had a quick idea to incorporate a piece of one characters backstory into the ongoing game, but shied off at the last second, because it felt a little forced. Not sure if I'll get a chance again.<br/><br/>Friday we resume our <b>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</b> game. With Supers media thick on the ground, appetites are whet for supers gaming. Finding consistent players for a Friday afternoon is rough, but the host's son was out of school, so we had enough to continue the game, albeit with a slightly different cast than we started with. Eh, not that unusual in the comics, so I roll with it. I ran the final part of the 3pp adventure <b>Disaster Day</b>, but I'm not invested in using his Hydra expy <i>The Horde</i> as a long term villain, so I had the whole works vanish after the finale, planting a seed for an upcoming reality-altering villain.<br/><br/>Saturday, I ran the <b>Starfinder</b> free RPG day adventure Skitter Shot at the request of the FLGS owner. I would have like to run something more supers-y or PbtA-y for Free RPG day, but I like staying in her good graces. I also figured it would be easier to fill a table for Starfinder... which turns out to have been an understatement. I had to turn people away.<br/><br/>A good portion of my players were kids, as well as one adult who I knew only played D&amp;D. This has me wondering if Starfinder can serve as a good middle ground to introduce people who have only played D&amp;D to non-D&amp;D RPGs.                        </div>

                            Slaad, I've found that the solution is to  add that sort of backstory stuff in prep, to the locations and tables in the module, rather than on the fly.                        </div>

My games of SWM have been comparably long. I know that isn't what <a href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">@Epidiah_Ravachol</a> leans toward, but I don't feel like I "play it wrong" either.                        </div>

<i>Next on "What did you play the week before last week?"...</i><br/><br/>Two Saturdays ago we invited a friend who hadn't played any RPGs before but had expressed interest in our little weird hobby. We ended up playing <i>Downfall</i> by <a href="/forums/profile/Caroline_Hobbs">@Caroline_Hobbs</a> - which we hadn't played before either. Turns out it was a really good choice of a game for a first-timer!<br/>Our haven was a picturesque city built on a lighter-than-water, free-floating island, with crazy customs of governance and economics. Its Flaw was <i><b>freedom</b></i>. It got weird fast. I'm positive we all had a lot of fun.<br/>A flaw we old-timers found with the game, though, is that it was hard to keep the main characters (the Hero especially) psychologically and behaviorally consistent while switching them around - we failed, in fact, insofar as we tried at all.                         </div>

                            We finished the second season of our Dungeon World campaign with the heroes defeating the world's most evil necromancer recently returned to unlife through the heroes’ actions. Reaching this goal left a lovely bittersweet sensation, what would they do now? How do you top putting stop to the biggest threat to the world?<br/><br/>The player’s where happy to take my offer that we further the timeline a couple of hundred years and they’d make new characters trying to make it in the broken world left by the current heroes’ adventures.<br/><br/>Seeing as in their pursuits to do good they have destroyed a waterway threatening to drying out half a continent, magically set fire to the Dark Gate of Death in the center of the world’s biggest city, destroyed one of the wealthiest coastal cities neighbouring it and set loose an ancient cannibal-magic cult on the world this could be some really bleak post-apocalyptic fantasy indeed.<br/><br/>Even though we will miss the braggart barbarian Sahir, the thief-turned-bard troll-minotaur Imovan, the “My-god-Onâtz-is-totally-not-the-same-as-the-ancient-elven-necromantic-god Ôrnatz” cleric Ansel, Pax the Vurm-devourer-god-embodied troll druid, Perrine the world’s only good elven warrior and Isyr the “Oh, I’m just very interested in fire” magician I am very psyched for season 3!                        </div>

The biggest hurdle is that we need to be able to play it in about 40 minutes total. Still very much a work in progress, and I'm thinking of a major overhaul, trying to implement Keys and some kind of recourse points you can earn playing to the keys and use to do certain actions in the city. Anyway, gonna be a slow re-write...</p></div></blockquote>
Could you please write more about this? If you need playtest I would be happy to run it with my students!</div></blockquote>
Basically, during the lessons throughout the year we learn certain principles about leadership in the Kingdom of God and how it stands in contrast to "worldly leadership". We start by comparing King Saul and King David basically going through the entirety of David's life before and during being a king. Around Christmas we see the difference between Christ as a king (becoming a vulnerable baby, in a manger etc.) and Herod, who killed all the male 0-2 year olds to prevent someone from taking his power. Near the end of the school-year we dip into the sermon on the mount and several parables about the heavenly kingdom. The principles we learned from that I'm wanting to build into the game about running a city. I've made one already, but I'm far from satisfied, because it kinda equates the richness of the neighbourhood to the contentment of it's people or the success as a neighbourghood, which is not the message of the kingdom. It does however, show the impact leaders can make in their choices on the city.<br/><br/>It's all in Dutch though, and the re-write is gonna take some time. I'm gonna try to make a working version before this Thursday to end the school-year with it. But again, this will be in Dutch, and I'm far from sure it wil work. I have some other things to do and write during the summer, so maybe I can work on it then, but it will not have priority. But maybe I could open a thread and post pictures and stuff.                        </div>

That's an easy fix, just flip the number from rich to poor.<br/><br/>Matthew 5:3-6. When you don't have any stuff you have room for God's rule. When you're hungry, you are in the promise. Matthew 6:28. Don't fret about clothes, just mellow out in a field and look at the night sky. Matthew 19:23. When you're content with worldly riches you can't get into the kingdom.<br/><br/>Make the game about generosity, sustainability and trust rather than untenable growth and "prosperity". Good luck♥                        </div>

                            One more snippet of <i>What we've been playing over the last couple weeks or so</i>...
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Rafu" rel="nofollow">Rafu</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Then on Wednesday evening (that is, Wednesday last week, as in 2 Wednesdays ago) we just did some prep-work for our 2-player <i>Leviathan Manifesto</i> + other games campaign. Yeah, it <i>has</i> grown so big and thick with unfinished plots that we actually felt the need to review them in order to plan for the next case! That's quite impressive, in terms of sheer size and complexity.</p></div></blockquote>
We eventually completed our prep and got to play the game - episode 15 in our crime&amp;surveillance saga. This was a game of <i>Microscope</i> played in three(-ish) installments, mostly on weekday nights.<br/><br/>We made it about the main recurring "villains" of our saga: a gang trafficking in human beings and counterfeit identities, whose strong ties with local law enforcement let them get away with the murders and arson they've committed to cover up for their "business" (their main hit-woman is a police officer, usually undercover as a sex-worker), and it turns out it was a politician who'd been running the gang from behind the scenes all along. We call them <i>La premiata ditta</i>, which means something like "The Most Distinguished Business" in Italian. We love to hate those people, especially the two scary, scary women who sit at the center of the web. But we decided to finally get rid of them for good...<br/>Thus, we bookended our Microscope game with our heroes' latest attempt to interfere with the gang as the starting point and the gangs' demise (at last!) as the ending point. Lots of what happened in-between wasn't our <i>Leviathan Manifesto</i> operatives taking action, it turns out (though that happened too), but the Distinguished Business themselves turning to in-fighting when they understood their usual methods of cover-up wouldn't be enough this time. Plus, a previously minor character getting elevated to protagonist status and being key to the fall of the gang: she went from being the somewhat rebellious child to a mid-level villain, to kidnap victim and hostage, to ally to the "heroes", to brave young woman testifying against surviving Distinguished Business criminals in court while keeping the operatives' involvement a secret.<br/><br/>Using the game to fill major spots in this ongoing, character-centered saga has yielded my best experiences with <i>Microscope</i>. The completely open-ended one-shots I'd played at conventions or as very casual games had been fun but a bit underwhelming, lacking focus and often feeling a bit cliché. But focusing on a relatively short time-span of mere weeks of in-fiction time (basically making a game cover what would amount to a double episode in a TV show) and having an established canon for a palette, with a few well-defined main characters to rely upon when we feel we need a conversation-oriented scene... that has really made <i>Microscope</i> sing for me. Now I love it.<br/> </div>

                            That's a really interesting approach to <i>Microscope</i>, Rafu. My experiences with it were similar to yours up until now; perhaps I'll try the "filling the gaps" you're using here sometime! Thanks for the writeup - excellent!                        </div>

                            We had two fun games of Marc's and my current (still under in-house playtesting) project, <b>Entry-Level Adventures</b> this week! Our rag-tag team of adventurers managed to be <del>excellent</del> adequate baristas despite some setbacks presented by, uh, our lack of ability to make coffee and some rogues that kept showing up to steal our panini grill. In the second game we were totally successful office interns and we're all expecting offers of paid employment soon! Our wizard even figured out how to answer the phone!<br/><br/>I also had the pleasure of finally playing <b>The Shab Al-Hiri Roach</b>, which I've been meaning to play for basically forever.

                            Thank you <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> , that is valuable input! Only, the game is not about personable happiness perse, but how leadership can positively impact it's surroundings. The funny thing was that last time I played the kids had eradicated poverty (NICE!) in the city but kinda opposed rich neighbourhoods and avoided lifting up the middleclass neighbourghoods to elite neighbourhoods, while there were events where rich/elite neighbourhoods could use their wealth to benefit poor or middleclass neighbourhoods and invest in them, lifting them out of poverty. (yikes, runaway sentence!)<br/><br/>Anyway. Gonna try have a sitdown and get the focus of the game straight before tinkering more. There seems to be interrest in this over here. I might start a new thread for brainstorming and questions to the hive-mind. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

Leadership? But the lamb ran away with the crown… ♥ <b>Edit:</b> Yeah, new thread!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Rafu">@Rafu</a>: Yeah, using Microscope to fill in backstories for NPCs, objects etc have been fun for us. Previous owners of our ship etc etc. Or "how come noone used this ancient bottle of healing potion the last 100 years?". Using it to <i>conclude</i> something <b>after</b> the players ran into it is cool too. Sounds like it worked well.<br/><br/>As for me… session 13 of <b>Tomb of Annihilation</b>. Really fun and good session. Getting up to speed on the hex crawl procedures, we went through eleven days. They have a new fun DMPC that I like, Musharib                        </div>

                            We continue our game of 1980's/1990's <b>Sorcerer</b>, which has been a fun exercise. It looks like we may be headed to some kind of finale now, though it's hard to gauge with this game - there's a lot of room for everyone to contribute, and sometimes things go in very unexpected directions.<br/><br/>My character has now been revealed to be a Demon, summoned (once again) by his own son (a half-Demon!), and is now possessed by another, more powerful Demon.

                            Games I've played in the last... week plus change<br/><br/><b>Starfinder</b> (last two thursdays) - I got brave and incorporated the backstory bits into the game. The character was the last survivor on a ship with signs of being consumed by dark energy. So I made two undead attacking them part of his old crew. The player didn't even notice; his wife did. I took from this that he was the sort who wanted to have a detailed backstory, not necessarily to use it.<br/><br/><b>The One Ring</b> - A friend ran this for our monthly indie RPG session at the FLGS, under the assumption that EVERYONE has read the Middle Earth books. A tabletop survey proved him wrong. Anyway, it was a fun session. It had some of the upside of Ryuutama (managing travel is important) without the downside (resource management.)<br/><br/><b>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</b> - I ran an online game by replying to a random ad for a discord based game. By happenstance, we got a fairly good if small group of players. They were all new to the system, and I had to talk them through building their characters. Once play got going, things went well. They were interested in using the DC universe as a setting, so I rolled with it. I basically took the setting as presented in the published DC universe books for M&amp;M and researched a few comics that came out in the area and decided when I was going to go off the beaten path. The players all found their own vibe of characters they liked and reveled in it. We had a Rogue/Parasite type power thief/super soldier, a Gorilla Green Lantern, and a gentle giant/hulk type. The Gorilla's scent abilities were surprisingly relevant. But there is something nice about using a character's sense abilities to move them along an investigative game.<br/><br/>I'm leery of online gaming because I find PbP games a little trying, but the discord thing sort of worked for me. I may have to investigate more in the future.                        </div>

                            I don't really see resource management as a downside. Now that the group has finally learned the super-convoluted and over-detailed encumbrance system that I made, it's become the focus on many of the meaningful choices. Putting your life on line to protect the rain collectors, fighting over tents, digging up graves to find arrows…all things that happened last session.<br/>And item slots are their most precious resource. Throwing away money to carry gathered rainwater…<br/><br/>Session… 14? I think? of <b>Tomb of Annihilation</b>. Really good and fun session. Lots of diplomacy. Really good at the table... some group problems that only show when we're away from the table <img alt=":bawling:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/bawling.png" title=":bawling:"/> </div>

                            Quoted from a post I wrote in March:
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Rafu" rel="nofollow">Rafu</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>[...] yesterday afternoon we welcomed back some friends by playing <i>Vast &amp; Starlit</i> together! 5-player game and a bit of an experiment role-playing with a toddler in the room...<br/>We created a really nice web of starting relationships, with basically each of the PCs holding alliances to different nation-states, belligerents in a cold war, rebel factions or criminal networks. The one who is an ideologically-motivated serial murderer of authority figures starting an all-crew meeting to establish leadership (ahem...) and it turns out the one who's <i>only</i> loyal to himself  was also the only one to carry a gun on-board. My PC actually designed our ship, but another one has been brain-implanted to become the only one capable of piloting it - he's both highly instable, and an anarchist leader type who's been lying to me all the time just to get the ship for his rebellion. Much more complex and politically charged than my average <i>Vast &amp; Starlit</i> experience!<br/>However, with such a significant sort of distraction as a small child in our not-especially-toddler-proof home (also unequal a distraction, in that of course her parents where disproportionately more taken with her than anybody else) we could actually squeeze way fewer play than usual in our 4-hour afternoon. We called it a promising first episode and resolved on continuing from there next time we manage to meet as a group - which might not be in a while, though. [...]</p></div></blockquote>
We got to finish that game! Two more sessions last Sunday and the Sunday before that. Playing at the parents' place made the toddler more manageable (her mom's a smooth operator), so the pace of play was slower than usual but faster than on the first session.<br/><br/>Content shifted from the political to the personal with a strong "lost at sea" vibe, as in the attempt to escape pursuit from a military patrol we crash-landed on an deserted planet with a very hostile environment. Loyalties were tested, but not the way I'd thought they'd be, and we got deeper into the most cryptic character's background. It ended with our ship (and PCs, now forged into a real crew) successfully joining the rebellion, but not before a hefty cost in human lives had been paid.<br/>In retrospect, with 5 PCs, one of them was clearly the main character, with 3 more sharing the spotlight for roughly a session each, while the 5th (mine) was content remaining a solid support character, in that hir motives remained skin-deep and as first established - hir relationships with the main character and the rogue ship being the important things about zie.                        </div>

It’s a taste thing (and an “I’m too old for this” thing), really. I just don’t consider time poring over gear lists fun anymore. Though it’s a finicky thing, I’m not a fan of making equipment totally irrelevant/handwaved either.

                            LotFP, Tower of the Stargazer. Spoilers below!<br/><br/><div class="Spoiler">I'm playing with three gaming friends from back in high school and introducing them to the OSR style of play. In our first session, they made two characters each, all of which had silly names that reflected the players' low investment in their characters. That was good, because Bradley Peat the (Scottish) Dwarf died trying to open the front door of the tower ("So," I asked him, "You just grab the snake-shaped door handle and try to open it?" "Yes.") <br/><br/>In last night's session, our 2nd, they started getting wiser, but not wise enough to avoid activating the telescope (a process which required them to do about 5 different non-obvious things in the right sequence). That meant Linus, the fighter, was turned into a laser and transported to the surface of Necropoli Centauri, where he was devoured by shambling moss creatures as his friend the MU watched through the telescope. The other highlight was probably that they found the treasure room and managed to deactivate the force fields protecting it. This took probably 45 minutes of real time. Ultimately, I had to give them a hint (which I only did because the Elf passed an Int check for it). The players seem to have had some real sense of accomplishment, but it was frustrating for me as a DM and I am questioning the design of that room.</div> </div>

                            Having people for dinner who had no experience whatsoever with role-playing games, of course we had to show them, as an after-dinner activity.

                            Today our Meetup group played its season finale of Headspace. The sixth and final session opened with all hell breaking loose, as my Handler, Jefferson, had leaked a video of the BBEG's all-revealing speech to a reporter. When they found out that there was never any radiation outside the domed city of New Atlantis, the citizenry started rioting and looting, and the Dome Security Agency imposed martial law. Our team hijacked a DSA van and high-tailed it to the corporate HQ of Mushroom Computers to rescue Chanel Laurent, my character's onetime (adulterous) lover and the only woman who knew a way out of the dome. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, during our all-or-nothing escape attempt, Chanel was gunned down by Dr. Friedrich, my former colleague at O.N.I. Corporation and collaborator on Project Argo, which had created the Headspace in the first place (as a tool for mind-control, of course! After all, what is any social media product for?) Drawing on the Infiltrator's martial arts skill, I hip-threw Friedrich, smashing his head into the concrete, while my daughter Miranda (the Runner) and Rudy the Ronin took out his goons. The campaign ended with our characters escaping the dome in a hovercar and driving off into the strange, natural sunlight of their first real sunset. <br/><br/>I liked Headspace more than I initially expected to. By the second session, we had more NPCs (and more significant NPCs) than probably any other game I've played in. And by the end of the game, I sympathized with my character more, and cared more about certain NPCs (his ex-wife and daughter, who later became a PC) more than in any other game I've played. Major props to the designers and our GM.                        </div>

                            Its good to start the week with gaming <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> After a very long hiatus I wanted to run something traditional, maybe a long epic fantasy campaign. What I ended up with is a campaign centered around the themes of spirituality, leaving mundane life behind and the mysteries of death...<br/><br/>Our setting is very loosely based of the most famous Hungarian RPG setting 'Ynev' and everything TSR tried to get rid of during the scandalous eighties (half orcs, assassins, demons, poisoins, drugs, nudity, etc).<br/><br/>The PCs are freshmen at the order of Catacombatan, a martial monk organisation specialized in guarding the Necropolis and the Gate of Death. They are all searching for some deeper / non trivial meaning for life. The first PC is a war hero/criminal who had enough after everyone she knew and cared for died in the massive world war currently destroying the whole setting. The other two PCs are fantasy 'fantasy arabs'. One is a merchant who got assassinated but somehow survived it, slowly dying from a mysterious poison. The other is an assassin <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> girl whose order got destroyed during the war.<br/><br/>The rules are a stripped down version of PbtA with extras from here and there. We are using the rules of states from The Veil instead of stats, but the actual states are from Ekman's theory of universal face expressions. They make every roll into a pyschologizing task ('Do you roll with anger or sadness?').<br/><br/>Instead of playbook moves we have themes from City of Mist and the direction of the campaign is to slowly get rid of logos themes in favour of mythos themes, achieving transcendence as a living legend. The players choose the following metaphors of death for their mythos: judgement, dream, out of body experience, answer, sickness.<br/><br/>Im very bad in traditional prep. So I organize campaign in an emergent way. There are short missions in every session but the focus is more on the downtime (Mouse Guard, BitD, Watch). I roll for random invokement of themes a la 13th Age's Icons. And ask questions like crazy. They help a lot!<br/><br/>We just had our first session after a character making one (fck i didnt do this 0-session thing since the early 2000s). The players seemed to enjoy the 1st session and are on the hook but they laughed so hard on my statement 'running a traditional campaign'. They are mostly trad gamers and for them, its anything but trad. For me its the most trad Im able to do now. A heavily character centered game about death cults and dilemmas of life. I have faced my boundaries and lost. But I enjoy it <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Much of that sounds really interesting, especially the themes. Do you have these rules write up anywhere?<br/><br/>Nice observations on the "trad" format, also; I can relate!<br/><br/> </div>

                            Since last update:<br/><br/><b>Monsterhearts</b>, GMing two sessions. Set in Lovecraft Country; the Infernal is trying to trade Dagon (who wanted him to take Becky, not Anna to the homecoming!) for Cthulhu (who doesn't care, so long as he drowns his date and tries to bring them back to life.) And the Queen may be an actual insect. My initial two attempts to run MH were so successful I scheduled four online sessions set in 1976 <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><b>Dracula Dossier</b>: the 1977 leg finished up with Tabby writing a damning memo begging Government to shut down Edom, then hieing off to Tel Aviv to begin information sharing with the shadowy Israeli occult agency We Remember.<br/><br/><b>Fate of Cthulhu</b> Beta Playtest. Dr. Kate Octavian has used her future tech to become Wired's entrepreneur of the year, perfect her human-portable railgun, and build a new Null Time Sphere. Her present-timeline analogue meanwhile has mostly wiped out Kate's own future. And now the Hounds of Tindalos are showing up...more madcap tentacled fun.<br/><br/><b>Monster of the Week</b> online at the Gauntlet. Dev has a problem. His on-again/off-again rival is in town, the sorcerer he betrayed a few years back is on the track of an evil artifact, and the artifact apparently is liquid Satan in a jar. Carpenteresque fun.<br/><br/>This week coming: Dexcon, offering 3 sessions of my own "Red Carnations on a Black Grave" and playing Witch, The Ward, Monsterhearts, Nemesis 382, Uncharted Worlds, and King of Arcadea.<br/> </div>

<b>Tomb of Annihilation!</b> Have lost track of session counts. The party was weathering a tropical storm and have dipped deeply into their rations. They are eating snakes and stuff to survive. I needed to polish the starvation rules because this was the first day of starving. Food hasn't been the bottleneck with so high survival. Water has.<br/><br/>Also trying out the new fight flow charts. I got confused! I was so petrified and nervous that I misplaced the action-econ cards, that I bumped the HP trackers etc etc. We had four fights and especially the first one was train wreck.

<b>Dexcon 2018</b> so a fuckton of games.<br/><br/><b>Fall of Magic</b> off-book on opening night because starting Sleep Deprivation Week with Sleep Deprivation isn't so awesome. This feels a million years ago so except for it being fun and the Baaahrleytown accent being a running joke I don't remember much.<br/><br/><b>Nemesis 382</b> with Mel White, as the Scottish captain of the <i>Sally Ride</i> who became psychic. We got to a good place eventually in this game.<br/><br/><b>Red Carnations on a Black Grave</b>, facilitating and playing Felix and Marie. This was a good run but felt a bit truncated; I need to find people to discuss how to make good scenes.<br/><br/><b>The Ward</b> playing the new Resident, visiting from London and addicted to having a chip on my shoulder. This was a fun bit of inspired madness by the excellent Kevin Petker.<br/><br/><b>Uncharted Worlds</b> set in <i>The Expanse</i>. I don't love UW but the MC had written some more Expanish-style moves that worked pretty well. I had fun playing a Terran Dr. Feelgood fascinated by all the ways New Atlantis could kill us. The game ended with a whopper of a Outside Context Problem.<br/><br/><b>Les Autres</b>, a <i>Trail of Cthulhu</i> scenario. Lisa Padol and I basically played the Nick and Nora Charles of Mythos investigators. "Let me explain my Bedsheet Dimension theory," was not only one of the funnier things I said at the con but astonishingly accurate.<br/><br/><b>Red Carnations</b>, just facilitating. This game landed better, with my ultra-leftist friend doing some great work playing two characters, one so doctrinaire that I tossed him the "Communist International" card I printed for characters that join after the start of the game, and the other willing to sacrifice anyone to escape with her husband. A very bitter Louise Michel was another highlight.<br/><br/><b>Witch, the Road to Lindisfarne</b> with the Divine Seraphina. This cooked and ended up fundamentally happy, with my foppish but deeply committed to noblesse oblige Sir Hayden engineering the successful escape of Berrick, Thorne, and the witch before dying a happy pilgrim in Constantinople.<br/><br/><b>Red Carnations</b>, just facilitating. This game basically was an all-star edition of some of my favorite roleplayers, and it landed hard, dark, and beautiful. There was queer polyamory, a tragic death by Versailles shelling, dear Camille as the brave Face of the Revolution, and a deeply tragic aftermath. This one shook us all, and hard, and it's the sort of thing you maybe pray your game will do but never believe you will actually see. The debrief was hard and painful. Catharsis is messy.<br/><br/><b>Monsterhearts</b>, as a coming-of-age road trip led by the excellent Jeff Collyer. This was different and cool, and unlocking the Adult Moves from the start of the game was a brilliant touch. Cass the butch AF werewolf who was basically cool with discovering she liked girls but was struggling with whether she was a girl who liked girls or a boy who liked girls was one of my favorite characters of the con, not just because I got to swear like a sailor and drop in grrrlpunk references.<br/><br/><b>Fall of Magic</b>, off book with Lucian Kahn and Brennan Taylor. This was Brennan's first game of Fall of Magic. You're doing something either very wrong or very right if three quarters of the party want to kill the Magus by the time you get to Istallia.<br/><br/>Overall, this was probably the best Dexcon I've attended and the first one that felt almost like Dreamation for me. I had no bad games, and several excellent ones, and spent a lot of time with some very excellent people.<br/><br/>I also played a lot of very surface-y characters (except for Sir Hayden) which was a bit of a change for me; in a lot of my own RPGing of late I've been experimenting with characters who are deeply sincere about what they are doing (especially my current Hardholder who is really committed to making at least a tiny bit of the world a better place.) Some of these characters were excellent fun, however, especially Nick Charles-expy Eugene Hahn and Cass.                        </div>

                            Dexcon!<br/><br/><b>Witch, the Road to Lindisfarne.</b>  The witch seemed really innocent through all manner of misadventures.  Finally, the squire rescued her, giving one of the knights a reason to believe she really was the devil.  And she was!  But with her liberation, all manner of horrific fates befell the other characters.  Most of them deserved it.<br/><br/><b>Monsterhearts</b> road trip.  Failed roll after failed roll (especially my witch's attempts to keep his cool) turned some simple misunderstandings into a disaster spiral.  Did we leave a trail of dead bikers, broken hearts, and withered teens, or was it all just a dream that one of us might be trapped in forever?  In a weird way, this was more harrowing than Witch, wherein I <i>expected</i> things to go horribly.  All the light, comedic, and familiar moments on the road trip made the tragedy feel that much more personal and avoidable.<br/><br/><b>With Great Power.</b>  With most of Omnidelphia occupied by a recent alien invasion, five new superheroes rose to the challenge and... well, saved lives, fought family, ran away, made social media sensations, and joined the aliens, respectively.  Great system for making colorful characters and roping in creative contributions from everyone.<br/><br/><b>Masks.</b>  Time to stop a sentient crab invasion from raiding the city museum for priceless cultural artifacts!  (Or start an international incident by sinking the badguys' own priceless cultural artifact in lava.  Or move a giant concert from a major public space to a shady warehouse.  Or nearly get fried by the mastermind behind it all, whose nefarious plan was to... see how his daughter (one of the PCs) was doing.)  Convoluted and impractical problem solving by kids with badass powers was the name of the game.  Somehow Aka, Manitou, Shift, Busy Body, Hooligan and Natural Disaster all survived.<br/><br/><b>Death Knights.</b>  I went to sleep early on Saturday so I didn't actually get to play this, but I watched the pitch and set-up and I love the concept.  Former mortals now become godlike agents of destruction, vying against their masters, each other, and their former attachments.  Great flavor for this PbtA in development.<br/><br/><b>The Final Girl.</b>  About 15 characters got off their cruise ship to hike the Outback and were killed off a few at a time by ratigators.  It was tons of fun filling out the cast and then thinning out the cast.  Unfortunately the final scene was sabotaged a bit by questionable rules use and brief table issues, but getting to the showdown between Steve the Bitter Tour Guide and Sparky the Wonder Dingo for "last one standing" was a blast.<br/><br/>Thanks to Seraphina, Shannon, Sarah, George, Andrea, Jeff, Joe, Kirk, Katy, Jenna, Michael, Charles, James, Christo, Mendez, River, Jeurgen, Josh M., Bailey, Davis, Josh G., Kathy, Keith, John and Anne for being awesome to play with.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Oh boy, have not posted in a while... there has been a lot of gaming in the past two months or so since my last post:<br/><br/><b>The Ward: Acute Care Edition</b> Finally got around playing this PBTA game that the group had been asking me to run. Not having run a PBTA before, I was a bit nervous about when to ask for dice rolls considering we mostly play freeform games. The game ran well, two of the players really got into their characters and there was plenty of tension to keep the story going. I did have one player not fully understand the theme of the game though, so that made it a bit difficult to get his character more involved in the narrative. We were in a run-down hospital in Las Vegas, and the action started with a plastic surgery gone wrong and drugs going missing in the facility as some employees started a drug-smuggling operation... As this was a one-shot, I did not know very well how to end it, but the play went well. (After talking with the author at Dexcon, the trick seems to be to systematically end the game at a cliff-hanger.)<br/><br/><b>Bluebeard's Bride</b> Another game that had been in the group's list of games to try. The theme of the game really came through during play. It does put a good amount of creative load on the GM though, so be ready.<br/><br/><b>Follow</b> Probably the game I enjoy running the most... We used "the Gods" campaign. We played a band of incompetent gods seeking worship and adoration from mortals we couldn't directly communicate with. After accidentally unleashing an army of plant monsters that almost decimated the human race and then failing to defeat those monsters in an otherwise epic battle, our cunning wit and mortal interlocutors managed to convince what was left of mankind to erect a bathhouse in our honor.<br/><br/><b>Fiasco</b> Using the News Channel Six playset, we explored the lives of employees of a struggling small market local news channel. While the news aspect of the TV station was struggling, the team found a way to become lucrative by providing ads for a local drug trafficking ring that was being run out of the local motel.<br/><br/><b>Welcome Guests</b> Breaking away from the tabletop for a bit, we got to play this parlor LARP as we had the right room and number of players. An Amish family invites over some hikers that got lost over for dinner, great conversation and meals!<br/><br/><b>Fiasco</b> Tales from Suburbia playset. What could go wrong when the Pedigree Champion Dog eats the drug infused brownies during Prom night? (Fiasco plays so much better when the setting is familiar to everyone)<br/><br/><b>Out of Dodge</b> Since Fiasco played fast, we had enough time for this quick LARP. The MTG players sitting next to us gave us lots of looks and came to ask us what we were doing...<br/><br/>And now Dexcon:<br/><b>The Rite</b> A quick freeform game. Only played one round of scenes. I think we needed to play a bit more rounds to get the effect the game was seeking.<br/><br/><b>The Quiet Year</b> I was pleasantly surprised as I thought we were too many players... but the facilitator kept things running smoothly and playing with lots of paper and color markers made things better. Also, it was great seeing the younger crowd get really into it as they had to make difficult decisions for the community.<br/><br/><b>Red Carnations on a Black Grave</b> Got to antagonize the author's ultra-leftist friend's doctrinaire character. Really enjoyed playing the game; got to play a comedy relief character in the form of the poet Felix and got a serious character in the form of Dominique, who had some tense scenes with Jean and his wife. Really curious to see how this game develops. The complexities that the relationships and worry the characters live in creates some really interesting and nuanced characters!<br/><br/><b>The Ward</b> Got to see how the author envisioned his game played. It was great! Got to play as a cynic orderly. (That playset was great).<br/><br/> </div>

                            Also Dexcon!<br/><br/><b>The Fantasy Trip:  Wizard</b>.  Played a pick-up game of this with my brother and roped in a few other players.  It’s a game of dueling wizards so we played without a GM and made up our own charts for environmental hazards and other problems on a series of floating platforms in limbo-like space.  Dice whiffing sucks but the prospect of a lucky roll keeps the game exciting.  I loved it!  Some, not so much.<br/><br/><b>Nemesis 382</b>: A geme from Pelgrane's <i>Seven Wonder</i>s book.  Facilitated this as we had plenty of players.  We used the pre-gens from the book so the characters all had some existing connections that came out nicely in play.  The Oscar goes to Aviatrix, though, playing a mission commander in tune with the black hole and the future it represented.  We ended up with two ships flying side by side into the black hole with no regrets.<br/><br/><b>Dungeon World:</b> A prison break-out scenario where I played a paladin alongside other prisoners of war with varying degrees of honor.  I was happy to save the prison Warden from an assassination attempt…He wasn’t grateful enough to free us but it set the conditions for our eventual breakout!<br/><br/><b>Top Secret:</b>  I used TSR’s new version of Top Secret to run a Mission: Impossible style adventure.  Characters knew the villain’s plan, they just had to stop it.  A safe house scene at the beginning of the game identified key technologies, deceptions, weak links, allies, etc., essential to the plan.  Subsequent scenes were all about implementing those key elements.  I was happy with this format and intend to refine it.<br/><br/><b>The Bloody-Handed Name of Bronze: </b> Michael Miller facilitated this for four players and we had a blast!  Michael provided some cheat sheets for the rules that helped a lot in terms of understanding how the dice work, when to add dice, etc.  In our game, the rotating GM encouraged broad strokes of time in our character arcs.  Among other things, we cut a flying castle out of the sky, built a city of spiders, succumbed to the evening star rather than drink only blood and walk only at night.<br/><br/><b>Star Trek:  </b>Tried out the new Star Trek RPG with a goal of getting a basic understanding of the rules.  So this was a fairly successful event.  The adventure was fun and felt like a Star Trek story.<br/><br/><b>Ryuutama</b>:  I used Ryuutama to play out an adventure in Afghanistan where the PCs are soldiers chasing after one of their own—Cacciato—who has left the war to walk to Paris.  The major hacks were devising new character classes and replacing magic with technology.  The Ryujin (dragons watching over the travelers) were replaced by, of course, drones.<br/><br/><b>Before the Storm:</b>  Facilitated another game from Pelgrane’s <i>Seven Wonders</i> book.  We planned three rounds of interactions for the four hour slot and just finished.  We could have used more time as we all enjoyed the character interactions taking place both in flashbacks and in the present.  A “meta” highlight was one player was planning to leave prior to play due to exhaustion but the shared setting creation process drew them back!       <br/> </div>

                            Regarding GSS, perhaps 'broken' is too strong a term, but the rules don't do much to support game play. There are some structures that need to be rigid but aren't, so it's down to the GM to just hand wave when new scenes begin and down to the players to constantly handout out Dreams on whatever pretext they like.

That makes sense, yeah. I'd definitely noticed that there's stuff it fails to support, for instance the whole structure. It really feels like that ought to be mechanized.<br/><br/>And the action resolution is definitely pretty awkward. There's definitely better ways it could have been handled, and I tbh don't understand why a slice-of-life game has task/conflict resolution mechanics in the first place, since the outcomes of specific individual outcomes is completely irrelevant to the slice-of-life genre.<br/><br/>I definitely feel like it's going to be fun, but I agree with your assessment of those parts having issues. <br/><br/>The game feels extremely hard on the GM, since they're handed a bunch of stuff they have to do without any proper tools to help them do it, which is actually one of the big reasons why my group and I are planning to modify it slightly to be GM-less after we play it RAW a couple of times (the other big reason being that we don't like GM-ed games).                        </div>

Go for it: in retrospect, I wish we'd done something like that. We had a lovely time with the game, but it would have been miles better if we hadn't had to worry over Dreams, Feelings and Wonder; I agree about the role of resolution mechanics in a slice-of-life game too.<br/><br/> </div>

Hmm, that could work. However, part of the reason why we're interested in GSS as a casual one-shot system is because of the fact that it's a lot simpler than Chuubo's, so thus takes much less set-up. <br/>My group and I were talking about it this morning, and we're probably just going to make some minor modifications to GSS and use it for casual one-shot stuff. We talked a bit about removing the GM, and replacing them with a figure more like the HG in Chuubo's, who plays NPCs but solidly isn't a GM. <br/>We're also talking about stripping out the action resolution mechanics, since they don't seem to play a terribly large role in the game's mechanical ecosystem anyways (the example scenarios and examples of play in the book have them used very very very minimally, with some of the scenarios not even using them at all).

Thank you! I kind of like the whole Dreams/Feelings/Wonder thing, tbh, with them as resources, but the resolution stuff just feels out of place for the genre. <br/>Hopefully the changes we're looking to implement will work out fine. My girlfriend talked to one of her friends who has run the game a lot, and that friend agreed that it probably wouldn't hurt the game to make the changes I talked about earlier in this post. <br/>I'll let you know how it goes after we play; I'm really looking forward to it! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            (looking bleary-eyed up from the pages of the 7th Edition Guide to Cthulhu Invictus which is almost ready for that final round (please Dagon) of corrections...)<br/><br/>18 and 27 June: Playtest of Fate of Cthulhu: I think it went well, and I have a fairly clear idea of where I need more guidance. But I think the foundation is solid, and once that's the case, everything else is way easier to tweak.<br/><br/>30 June-2 July: Filker at Concertino, which included a half hour concert with the rest of Goldberry (our band). Fun, though I am thinking I should never be allowed to play with signs on stage. I either dance too much for anyone to read the sign I'm supposed to be holding, or I'm a klutz and it falls into the microphone when I'm trying to put it down.<br/><br/>4 July-8 July: DexCon<br/><br/>Wednesday Night: Part of a game of Fall of Magic. Would've been great to finish it later in the weekend, but that so was not happening.<br/><br/>Thursday Morning: Sleeping in, at least as much as the hotel lets one. I may have to go back to bringing a small humidifier. I kept waking up panting for breath, and that generally does not happen -- but I'm fairly sure it's happened at this hotel before.<br/><br/>Thursday Afternoon: Pasion de las Pasiones! A little bumpier than when the author ran it, which is something the author's going to want to know, as the whole point is not to have to package a clone of author with every copy. Still heaps of fun, with over the top twists and turns.<br/><br/>Thursday Evening: Not So Quiet for Trail of Cthulhu. Interestingly challenging scenario to run in a four hour slot, and I've some thoughts on how that can be done a little more smoothly. We still managed a combination of drama, dark humor, and growing horror which we handled in a way that seemed perfectly logical, but was horribly wrong, which is just fine for that sort of game.<br/><br/>Friday Morning: Thousand Arrows vs The Sprawl, which was testing the question: How little can one change Thousand Arrows in having it do cyperpunk? As far as I can tell, mechanically, one doesn't need to change a lot. I mean, the setting, obviously, and a whole lot of chrome, but the rules seemed to work just fine with the genre change. A lot of fun, and a genre mashup that was very different than what I've played before.<br/><br/>Friday Afternoon: Les Autres, for Trail of Cthulhu, which is where Aviatrix and I did our Nick and Nora Charles imitation. Somehow, we all managed to not die horribly. I think this one is solid, and I really hope the author talks to folks at Pelgrane about getting it published one she's decided all the parts are there so that she doesn't have to clone herself for every package.<br/><br/>Friday Evening: I crossed my name off for this game, as I could feel my energy level go thud. I'd been fairly jagged with energy ups and downs all day, and would not have been a net positive at the game.<br/><br/>Saturday Morning: Lord Scurlock, which we were told to think of as a pilot episode. This was fun, and if the series were to get picked up, I'm dubious about whether my character survived the pilot. I got sloppy towards the end where we were trying to go for gonzo over the top, and this was a decision made pretty quickly after a look at the time. We weren't trying to go from 1 to 11, but we were trying to from 6 to 11 on a dime, and I wasn't quite keeping up. But we managed to get to an appropriate cliffhanger.<br/><br/>Saturday Afternoon: Red Carnations on a Black Grave. A fair amount of bleed, and... I may be wrong, but I suspect we'd all do it again. I got complimented on my roleplay, which felt sort of like being praised for the perfect kick to the puppy, which is probably a weird way to be feeling since I was deliberately setting up to do that kick. I think the waves of that one are still reverberating. (Got an aftershock while looking up the Bread and Roses strike on account of Goldberry meeting this Tuesday and rehearsing it with our two lyric tweaks. I'm not sure how to do a Bread and Roses version of this genre of game given the combination of a historic win that was followed by a loss of a lot of what was won over the next year or so, but that loss would be epilogue material, as the climax has to come with the end of the strike.)<br/><br/>Saturday Evening: Monsterhearts: Road to Nowhere, which was an interesting experiment, as all of the growing up moves were available to everyone. While I think we could have used an extra hour or so, we managed to get things to a satisfactory conclusion, which was helped by the dice that, after messing with us in early and mid game, suddenly started giving us 11s and 12s. My brain is still chewing on this, trying to figure out what kind of a campaign-length game one has when all of the characters are able to use the growing up moves all the time, and what kind of game one has the season _after_ that one.<br/><br/>Sunday Morning: The 2018 200 Word RPG Challenge Showcase, where we played two games, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23winterintospring&amp;Mode=like">#winterintospring</a> and Dear Elizabeth... These were a lot of fun, even though I'm not that up on the blogosphere as a whole.<br/><br/>Saturday Afternoon: Taking advantage of the movie theater to transition out of con mode by watching Ant Man and the Wasp. <br/><br/>11 July: Wrapped the first scenario in Our Ladies of Sorrow (CoC, but used Trail of Cthulhu rules, modified by some Fall of Delta Green tweaks) and I think it went well. Amazing players are amazing. This one was set in July 1963, running from the 1st to the 6th or 7th. The next scenario will be set in 1967, probably during the summer as well. I need to work on the hooks and to find some more poisoned apples, as folks devoured the ones I had.<br/> </div>

                            I played a dingy cave halfling in a Torchbearer game, the first of a summer campaign while I'm visiting NYC.  Two ruby-hunting dwarves had dug too deep and stumbled into the cave network where I've spent for an untrackable amount of time (possibly years?).  We severed the head of a cave worm they had killed and started to scale nearby cliffs together.  I had my heart set on seeing sunlight again and the dwarves were eager to sell the giant worm head.  We made it to the top but ended up running into a patrol of Carreg (clay-like cave folk) who tried to capture us.  We fled, and were caught, but the Carreg seemed willing to talk.<br/><br/>The game was really fun; all experienced players with a few houserules that were new to me.  Especially with players I don't know, the 'rewards' are my favorite part of the game.  I love that they ask you to tell other players what you appreciate about their contributions.  It's a feel-good moment.                        </div>

                            Played a good game of Matthew Gwinn's <i><a href="https://www.errantknightgames.biz/thbdaw" rel="nofollow">The Hour Between Dog and Wolf</a></i> in short installments over the last few weeks.<br/><br/>Barbara played a mission-oriented, vigilante-like serial killer who murdered violent or abusive men because, in his mind, there was no other way to save their wives' or daughters' lives. He worked a day job at a helpline call center, which was how he found out prospective victims, and had a therapy-like ritual of holding a gun to the men's head while asking them to explain why they'd done what they had. Invariably, he found them irredeemably evil and killed them with a bullet to the forehead. A scary character, but also very human, frail, almost pity-inducing.<br/>I played a fraud of a "psychic" (a high-roller modeled in part after <i>The Mentalist</i>'s Patrick Jane, but somewhat older) who was trying to bust the killer for fame, fortune and ambition, not content of forever remaining just a boring, laughable local gossip celebrity. I started off all cocky and self-assured... a couple of unlucky dice rolls in a row and I got my ass handed to me, painfully and slowly.<br/>Early enough in the game, the killer basically walked up to me and confessed, knowing I couldn't prove anything. And I couldn't! The police was so far behind on the case they hadn't even connected the murders as serial. I repeatedly failed to get heard, until, a couple scenes before the end, they started accusing <i>me</i> of the murders (this was your typical Ruination Scene, as the killer's Control trait had risen to the stars, which leeks out into the setting as police incompetence).<br/>It didn't end well. Well, it ended with fisticuffs at the waterfront... But when I realized in my frustration I really wanted to <i>kill him</i>, and then I would be exactly like him - not to mention give him what he was <i>asking</i> for - I chickened out and let him go. I was left with a broken life while he moved cities and kept doing his thing unhindered.<br/>It was disheartening. Intense, bitter, painful. Also pretty good.                        </div>

                            That game sounds awesome Rafu♥<br/><br/>We played <b>Tomb of Annihilation</b> which isn't a metal band but a campaign for 5e.<br/>These last two sessions have been mostly hack and slash, there are RP and exploration entries on the encounter tables but they've come up in fewer proportion than usual. That's just dice, I'm not worried.<br/><br/>We're having fun though. Exploring the tactics of the new combat/positioning rules, we have enthusiastic buy-in from the entire party on that. We all love tactical games and it's been really interesting and dynamic. The dodge action is seeing a lot of use.<br/><br/>And the former most intensive naysayer of the item slot system is now on board, having fun managing his gear, and is like "you should put this on the DM's guild". Yeah, a few more iterations first, I have some improvements in mind.                        </div>

The fire was totally not her fault, not even a little.<br/>Who wound up being murdered? Joyce fired shots, but I don't think she killed anyone. Am I misremembering?<br/><br/> </div>

                            Yesterday, final official beta playtest session of Fate of Cthulhu. Lots of feedback for Evil Hat in one pan of the scale. In the other... so, the playtest is done, and we don't know if there will be a gamma playtest (and are SO in for that if there is), but we have another session of the game scheduled for later this month.<br/><br/>Also, we finally found something that was too wacky even for our run of this game.                        </div>

An important discovery! Meanwhile Arthur Holmwood left the group, traveled to Leeds where his familiy owns a coal mine and persuaded the leading mining engineer to pick up as many sticks of dynamite as possible and follow him back to London.

                            Session two of summer Torchbearer campaign in NYC.<br/><br/>Ruadri the halfling and Yoggo the Dwarf had been captured by the Carreg.  Neither hero can understand the language of these cave-folk, but Yoggo recognized one word: Bethelen, the name of a legendary wizard.  From this, Ruadri was able to glean that the Carreg were looking for Bethelen.  Through a combination of gestures and crude drawings in the sand, Ruadri made the Carreg an offer: they would bring Bethelen to the Carreg in exchange for their freedom.<br/><br/>The ensuing search was some of the most gripping play I have experienced in any rpg.  We had no weapons, a single bundle of torches, and nothing to eat or drink.  We were searching an unmapped cave network for a wizard we knew nothing about.  Ruadri and Yoggo had to scale cliffs, outrun a venomous scorpion, and fight at the edge of a nigh-bottomless pit.  It was a satisfying mix of logistical challenge and tragic roleplay, with both characters at the edge of hopelessness.  Every roll that didn't bring us closer to death felt AMAZING.<br/><br/>We are now following an eerie call into a dark tunnel, and our last torch has guttered out.<br/><br/>Looking forward to dying next week.                        </div>

<b>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</b> Discord game. The  group reveled in seeing their favorites from the comics show up... Green Arrow, Swamp Thing, and a Black Lantern Prometheus. I'm sort of seeing that voice-only communications does put a damper of interactions to the point that I think I Discord-only gaming has a lower maximum player cap than face to face.<br/><br/><b>Fragged Empire</b> - Played this at the monthly Indie gameday at the FLGS. The game has a tactical/grid-based mode and a "theater of the mind" mode. The GM switched between them in the two fights. This opened up a few different possibilities for gameplay (in the "mapless" version, my character tried to pin a genetically engineered monstrosity under a console with her nightstick, which would have been suicide in tactical mode), but switching between them felt jarring and it seemed like the character layout supported the tactical mode better.                        </div>

<b>Fate of Cthulhu Playtest</b>: Dr. Kate enjoyed a wonderful breakfast at her Yokohama hotel while locking the Deep One hybrid and his out of time son in a green room, before finishing the day by taking her railgun for a romp with reprogrammed clone Ith/Jule. Of course, said clone has managed to lock her programming out from Dr. Kate, her current-timeline self just had the baby Kate never had in her own timeline, and oh yeah the divergence event is rapidly approaching. At least she still has the null-time sphere.<br/><br/><b>Dungeon World</b> online at the Gauntlet: Breda Hjalmarsdotter deals with more vanishings, a possible fae interested in moral education, and swamp abominations. All while still not putting on her armor. Being a repentant paladin is hard work.<br/><br/><b>Masks, the New Generation</b>: Aaliyah the Nova reaches out to her arch-nemesis (revealing too much), reprograms Uncle Hussein's brain (wiping out too much), and spends Thanksgiving weekend in a ski lodge in Canada with Polar Vortex, Jade the Outsider, and Buddha, Jade's pet porcupine. It all ends with a fight in a park. Too bad they had just finished remounting the statue she threw at people with her mind last time...<br/><br/><b>Good Society</b>: Lady Lucy DuVal, the Hedonist, and the almost-but-not-quite-yet Rev. Nigel Fopsworth brought some Dangerous Liaisons vibes to this otherwise quite Austenian little comedy. It ended with a couple of not-particularly loving marriages, although for Lucy and Fopsworth their match at least let both of them pursue yummy men...in India. (Lucy to Nigel: "I know some people in the Honourable East India Company. The main requirements seem to be drunkenness and malaria. Do you think you could catch malaria?") A lovely game all around.<br/><br/><b>Monsterhearts</b>: A sort-of-in-continuity game in my Kingsport setting. The Hollow can't remember anything more than a few days ago, the Mortal is understudying Laura in "The Glass Menagerie," the Infernal's Dark Power wants him to kneecap the current Jennifer, the Fae is bored of everything, and the drama teacher seems to be leading some kind of cult. A fun little game even if I gave the evil cultist drama teacher the same name as my 6th grade teacher, who looked kinda like Tom Selleck and was a really nice guy.

                            Tonight I showed some friends the <b>Otherkind Dice</b> post and they liked it, so we wanted to try it out and settled on a version of <b>Otherkind shadowrun</b>. A team made up of a human adept, dwarf rigger and troll shaman went on mission to Austin tx to track down one of the now infamous Ted Cruz clones in an attempt to figure out where these surprisingly durable clones were being produced.<br/><br/>Our mission lead us to the <i>Treetop bar</i> on sixth street, a building sized found art structure with lots of local flair. After getting in with our weapons without a hitch we managed to spot the clone in question. Unfortunately we didn't realize a rival shadowrunner team was also present, which was made up almost entirely of the our teams ex's. <br/><br/>The Ted Cruz clone got spooked early on while the two teams fought and jumped off the side of the building. The Adept went after only to find this clone was tough as nails and a decent hand to hand fighter to boot. <br/><br/>Finally everyone made it down to the alley where the troll Shaman fought off a spectral rhino summoned by the opposing team's mage, while the rigger provided air support. Until the Ted Cruz clone was finally subdued with a chi sleep spell before it could attack with the extra power it had gained by absorbing the other Ted Cruz clones that had mysterious arrived on the scene. <br/><br/>The other team took some covering fire from the rigger's vehicle as our 'heroes' made a quick getaway. <br/><br/><i>A somewhat condensed version, but the game wasn't</i> too <i>much longer than that. A little clunky at first, especially coming up with dangers to establish, but we got used to it quickly. I like how past dangers would help establish new ones. </i> </div>

                            NYC Torchbearer #3:<br/><br/>Ruadri and Yoggo spent days crawling through the dark caverns, first in total darkness, then with makeshift candles.  Yoggo nearly fell to his death while traversing a narrow ledge. We failed test after test and went right down the death spiral, both of them gaining every condition but injured and dead.  We had great character and environment roleplay throughout, thinking through how these two responded to hopelessness and what desperate gambits they would make to survive.<br/><br/>The big turn was when we finally camped down and Yoggo made a decent map.  We were able to follow that back to water.  There were some Carreg drawings by the pool and Ruadri copied them down to learn a bit about Carreg communication.  The two dungeoneers then returned to the Carreg camp to tell their story and explain their need for more supplies to carry on.  The Carreg returned Yoggo and Ruadri's confiscated gear and the two set off, back into the darkness to find a wizard.<br/><br/>This was a dense nugget of play that I couldn't imagine being interesting in any other system, but was 100% satisfying in Torchbearer.  I earned my first 'Moldbreaker' reward for acting against a belief.  Ruadri went from believing "Revelry makes a candle a hearth" to "Fear of Death is a shackle to be broken".                        </div>

<b>The society of dreamers</b><br/>Finally! I prepared the game, built an Ouija-board, drove to a con and found three teammates (all were experienced game masters). We played 6 hours and it was a rewarding experience. Afterwards I asked them, if they´d be interested in a mini-campaign of Wilhelms "Okult". They confirmed. One of the best Con experiences ever!                        </div>

                            I ran <b>The Expanse</b>, from the free quickstart rules/adventure that Green Ronin released a little bit ago. The AGE system plays fast and pretty "trad," and we had a great time.<br/><br/>The quickstart is really great, actually. It features gay characters without the sexuality being anything other than preference. It has a "random NPC chart" that can generate characters of non-binary status and varied non-EuroAmerican background. It boasts fantastic color art depictions of people of color. One of the two mob bosses is a woman.                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Adam">@Adam</a>, cool!<br/><br/>Since I posted last, our old-school adventure game progressed. Here's a few notes from the last sessions (long post!):<br/><br/><b>Session 27</b><br/>The dinosaurs fought in the pits and died valiently, netting the party some much-needed cash. Corey negotiated the use of warehouse space for a Portal door in exchange for future magical counter-espionage work. The party traveled to the Quweiq Mines via Al Awaj. They were ambushed by shocker lizards in the desert, but narrowly managed to survive. In the mines, they were ambushed by cultists, who fled. In pursuit, they quickly found a shaft to the second level of the mines, where they left a shield door as an access point.<br/><br/><b>Session 28</b><br/>The party returned to the shield door in the mines, to find that it had been moved by something with claws. They went about exploring to get their bearings. There were ambushed by two imps, who killed their sole hireling. They traversed a long hallway covered in thick, goopy green slime (without injury, thanks to Corey's wormhole). They discovered a hidden escape entrance into the Cult Champion's quarters, which they mucked up before surprising him, the Head Cultist, and a henchman in the Cult Throne Room, along with a Bone Demon. (They were eating a freshly slaughtered minotaur. Slaves were chained to the walls.) The party drove away the High Priest, killed the Champion, freed the slaves, and made their escape when the High Priest returned with reinforcements. The Champion's body was pulled from the burning room as the party escaped.<br/><br/><b>Session 29</b><br/>The party regrouped and created their first Stronghold, a warehouse in Al Ain with jetty frontage. They left the three minotaurs and the human slave to recuperate and journeyed back to Quweiq Mines. Originally Alzilu was dispatched by boat to set up a portal, but he bailed when the boat was attacked (and sunk) by fire eels, though he was able to rescue all the people aboard the boat.<br/><br/>Next, the party traveled overland, but were ambushed by sand worms in the desert. Alzilu took a catastrophic injury, but the party arrived at Quweiq, set up a portal, and retrieved the recuperated minotaurs, who--after reaching the antechamber to the cultist's demense on the second level, found their bearing and led the group to an impromptu, refugee-style camp where the Sangonth escapees were living. Aseer (the white female minotaur) appeared to be an important leader in the camp. The group partook of the minotaur's "hospitality" and camped in their quarters.<br/><br/><b>Session 30</b><br/>Speaking with the Sangonth minotaurs, the party discovered that the Korgash are set up on the third level, and that Squid-Men of some unknown nature dwell deeper in the mines. They also discovered that the cultists had recently began raiding the minotaurs for slaves/food (the diabolists are sadistic cannibals), presumbly after a lull in new adventurers for them to capture, torture, and eat. The party convinced the (not too bright) minotaurs that the cultists must be in league with the hated Korgash minotaurs. The enraged Sangonth mustered a party of 15 angry minotaurs, led by Aseer, with the goal of assaulting the cultist's demense, freeing the remainder of the dozen Sangonth slaves held there, and murdering every last "Korgash loving" cultist.<br/><br/>The minotaur's approach was direct: they literally just stormed the cultists via direct assault. The party reluctantly joined in the running combat. Many, many cultists were killed--nearly 25--but ultimately only three minotaurs (including Aseer, by chance) survived to free the drugged minotaur slaves (nine survived, the other six having been executed as the assault began). Unfortunately, the party was trapped in a dead-end room. From the adjacent mine chamber, they heard a familiar voice, the Cult Champion, though he sounded strangely hoarse: "Back again so soon? Good. You'll be delicious. I'll savor every bite." (Cliffhanger ending before the break.)<br/><br/><b>Session 31</b><br/>Lots of combat as the frontal assault continued. After debating their approach for some time (while trapped and contained in the back room), the party eventually hatched a plan, just as invisible imps attacks by again exploding any open flames, thereby dropping the mine chamber into darkness. (If the party had waited longer to hatch a plan, they may have been slaughtered. I was tracking Exploration Turns in real time as they debated, with the imps attacking in two Turns.) While the minotaurs held off the cultist initiates and warriors in the hallway, Scheherazade and Angus fought off imps and, later, a pair of bone demons (one of whom Angus ripped back into Hell with his Spiked Chain-Whip of Disruption.) Meanwhile, Corey created a wormhole through which Alzilu cast Transmogrify Surface, using golden liquid from the mummy tomb to douse the area. Unfortunately, both the Cult Champion and the High Priest made their saves and escaped the area before dissolving into golden liquid. The High Priest rolled a good result from the magic fountain fluid and gained +1 Might and Knowledge, effectively leveling up. The Cult Champion, on the other hand, aged 30 years in a matter of minutes. Both fled to regroup. The vulture demon, however, died instantaneously by collapsing into golden liquid itself. Many of the minotaurs died killing the remaining cult initiates and warriors, but Aseer again survived (by chance), with the human translator/man servant Herst bandaging her wounds.<br/><br/>The party tried to track the Champion and High Priest, and in doing so explored more of the facility; they discovered several mine chambers set up as barracks, including two warriors trying to don armor. Both were killed, after the second failed to be imtimidated by Alzilu's shadow form and by the physical torture the party inflicted on him. The party also discovered the Slaughter Pits, including meat hooks, quicklime pits, a bleeding floor, and lots of abbatoir instruments, as well as a specialized torture room. Eventually, they stumbled upon a cultist scout and dispatched him, but not before he cried out to warn the remaining cultists, who had holed up in a defensive posture in the Throne Room. The party tried to charge in, but discovered that they were outnumbered now that the minotaurs had retreated to recover: four warriors, four initiates, two bone demons, and a black vulture demon all occupied the Throne Room, in addition to the Champion and High Priest. One round of combat ensued, in which Alzilu took a minor injury, before the party cast Revisitation and retreated to Umiyid City.<br/><br/>ETA: Campaign website, linked to the setting <a href="https://coreac.neocities.org/primer.html" rel="nofollow">Primer</a>, if anyone is interested.                        </div>

                            NYC Torchbearer #4:<br/><br/>Yoggo and Ruadri left the Carreg camp and headed deep into the cave, hunting for loot.  Both heroes were eager to get to town, but not so eager to go in empty-handed.  They scaled a number of cliffs and scrambles, burning through their gear and racking up conditions along the way.  They were diligent about frequent camping to stave off the grind of dungeoneering, but a few unlucky rolls quickly put them in a desperate position.<br/><br/>After days of feverish searching, Yoggo’s intuituon ultimately led them to a boon; the bloody feasting pit of the now-dead cave worm. Yoggo attempted to craft some crampons to scale the tunnel down to the loose clay broke apart and he tumbled into the depths. There, he crafted a ladder out of chitin to let him up to a treasure laden ledge.<br/><br/>Another dwarf came down the landslide into the cavern and stumbled into Ruadri. He was Snorgg, an old friend of Yoggo’s who prickled at the addition of a halfling to their once-proud dwarven band.<br/><br/>Snorgg and Ruadri hauled the treasure (including a huge worm egg!) up of the pit and helped Yoggo back up to safety.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this session, especially Yoggo's evocative leverage of his belief: "The greatest craft is forged in the fire of the heart, and its name is Courage."  His flame wavered this session, but never sputtered out. Shane is killing it.<br/><br/>I felt some of the double edged sword of highly-invested Torchbearer play this time.  It can feel futile to be running through resources faster than you can accrue them, and that is especially true when you are having to take a hit to skills from suck it up/ sweat it out, since advancement is otherwise the one resource you can count on developing over time. <i>And yet</i>, when you're spending your last check to recover from a condition that you think might kill you, and you land 3 successes on 3 dice, there's real cheering and high-fives all around because you know all there are innumerable possible paths to your halfling's grisly death, and you <i>really </i>want him to see the sunlight before he goes.  Hat's off Simon (the GM) for bringing that pressure every time.                        </div>

                            Playing in a con game one shot of <b>Monsterhearts 2</b>.<br/>The MC did the thing that I sometimes see new MCs do — not really good at <i>letting time pass</i>. We had a 4h slot, 1h setup (fine♥, included rules explanation) and 3h gameplay. And in those 3h of tabletime, maybe 20 mins passed diegetically. A lot of the hoox we set up went nowhere because it was so decompressed. Letting time pass is one of the most underdiscussed DM/GM/SM/MC skills.<br/><br/>The MC was really good at poignant deets. The infernal's patron was a guitar busker, that was cool. I was the queen, a non-supernatural leader of sort of a slasher cult. We also had a vampire and a mortal, the mortal dropped the game after the setup tho.<br/><br/>Everyone else at the table, MC &amp; other players included, seemed intent on treating my queen as low-status (outside of the gang). So I went author stance and leaned into that, letting her fail, letting her try &amp; be rejected. It made me miss Hillfolk where you don't have to author stance as much, since what I want to do is aligned with what the game wants me to do; my character wants to engage the other PCs. Unlike MH where I constantly had to nudge ourselves into interacting more.                        </div>

                            I got to play quite regularly the second half of July. Our meetup group has grown and we are now consistently getting two tables going, which means we have gotten to play new games more often as there have always been enough players willing to try something new.<br/><br/>The games we played since my last post:<br/><b>Archipelago</b> The setting was a Caribbean world, where the merfolk and humans had just emerged from a war under a tenuous peace. Resentments remain on both sides, with the merpeople divided on how to react to humanity’s continued presence and incursions into their territories. <br/><br/><b>Out of Doge</b> Got to play it again with a different group as we had some time to kill during a gathering on a weekend. It was an  art heist gone terribly wrong. Ended with two of the characters getting some ice cream after disposing of the two other ones...<br/><br/><b>Until We Sink</b> Lots of drama in the family run hotel as the father (and hotel owner) does not want his daughter to leave as he needs her to stick around to keep the struggling hotel a float. Two affluent guests are staying at the hotel, trying to convince the daughter to leave and explore the world. The first scenes were a bit rough, but the game got really going in the later scenes, providing a great play experience. The group seems to like this style of game. Are there other games like this one that you would recommend?<br/><br/><b>Tall Pines</b> The townspeople of Tall Pines became embroiled in a murder mystery when a promising teen musician died under mysterious circumstances... or so it seemed. His death brought quite a few loads of dirty laundry out to air. Our “series” followed an aspiring filmmaker, an especially friendly debutant, a criminal mastermind, a butterfly mystic, and two officers of the law as they uncovered harrowing secret after harrowing secret about their small mountain community. Most of them died. <br/><br/><b>Downfall</b> Our Flaw was 'Survival of the Fittest' and our elements were fire, death, and trees... what this meant was people that lived in huge trees and who would burn every year the weaker family tree. This was one brutal games of Downfall; usually we end up playing goofy themes but the way the Flaw combined with the Elements made for a very aggressive community. Roleplaying the antagonist was perversely fun.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>

I don't have a smartphone so I grabbed the back of an envelope and wrote down a character using the standard array.<br/><br/>Really fun group. One guy was hard to play with — especially in a group that size, seven players — and he left. Could be that he got annoyed with me. He was the kind of guy that 1. doesn't know how much they talk, 2. doesn't know how loudly they talk, 3. doesn't know how little he lets everyone else talk, and 4. doesn't listen, doesn't interact, doesn't care about other PCs. He was also the only guy but I know plenty of sweet guys♥ so I don't hold him against the rest of you guys♥<br/><br/>He could be awesome in a smaller group because he wanted to create a backstory, talk about it etc etc.<br/><br/>I backseat DM:ed AF! But trying to sort of direct us players into a unified voice, giving the leadership to some of the more softspoken &amp; new players. And they ended up having a blast after the guy left.                        </div>

                            D&amp;D every day for a while?<br/>Today the 2p <b>Keep on the Borderlands</b> campaign with two of the players from my Tomb of Annihilation group. They have a lot of NPCs with poignant back stories, they've taken on a husband and wife team, Lashak and Kinetel. And one of the <div class="Spoiler">captives from the hobgoblin torture chamber</div> has joined the party, Faray.<br/><br/>Lashak got lost and separated from the rest of the group, Kinetel has lost a leg and Faray has lost an eye and has also internal bleeding. The lingering injuries rule is amazing♥<br/><br/>Kinetel is still working for the PCs but without her husband and her leg… the tension at the table is…<br/><br/>Also. My house rule was very cruel: They used drama tokens on the goblin boss &amp; I spent that to give them disadvantage on the encounter check on the way home.

                            Ran another session of my <b>Masks: A New Generation</b> monthly. It was supposed to be the last session for a friend who is moving, but he cancelled because he had moving stuff going on. So I wrote his character out by having him promoted to the Superior Six, the industry-branded super-team sponsored by Rook Industries (which is about this universe's equivalent to being sponsored by Lexcorp).<br/><br/>I also deleted his character from the influence matrix I wrote up for the game. <br/><br/>That was a mistake. An NPC in a potentially adversarial relationship with the PCs that has influence to/from multiple PCs is like a gold mine in masks, and I really shouldn't have overlooked that (which became clear partway through the game). As it stands, he looks to fill a role similar to the one Speedy played in Young Justice.                        </div>

                            GenCon, so lots of stuff -- everything I signed up for, plus a GoD game of Psi-Run, first time I'd ever played that. I ran two sessions of Clockwork: Dominion and played one game of Night's Black Agents, two of the Yellow King RPG, one of 2nd edition Grim War, one of Call of Cthulhu, one of Savage Worlds Kerberos Club, one of I Was a Teenage Creature, and one of GRAM. I also got a quick demo of the Cypher system (as we both knew I was too exhausted to focus on anything longer) and an explanation of Invisible Sun (which still leaves me with a question about what the game's actually about, but it's not like I had the budget or the luggage space to buy it).                        </div>

                            Was at a small RPG convention, played in/ran/facilitated three games. The problem with this particular convention is that 3-hour slots are enforced (except for the occasional double slot, making it 6 hours): that's always too short for me!<br/>(I'm also skipping the games I've played in July, despite that being quite an interesting topic - perhaps in a later post?)<br/><br/><b>The King is Dead</b> with 3 old friends and a relatively newbie player (who became/we made king eventually). We started late and had to rush the ending a bit, but still really good! My first time playing TKiD, but I'd played <i>Firebrands</i> - got an impression TKiD improves on that! It's fun (for a given definition of "fun") when the reunion between two star-crossed, almost-lovers segues into <b>war</b>. Would definitely play again.<br/><br/><b>Crawl a dungeon w/Rafu</b> (that's actually [a reasonable translation of] what I called it on the convention schedule).<br/><small>A friend joked that, considering how easily the event filled up, next time he thinks of running a dungeon crawl at that convention he'll include an NPC named "Rafu" so he can technically call the game like that.</small><br/>I ran a party of five through (the first couple rooms of) <i>The Sky-blind Spire</i> by <a href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">@Fuseboy</a> using an (incomplete) set of rules I'd just cobbled together from scratch and salvaged parts. They worried way too much at the front door, discovered a secret passage by applying torch-fire and getting burned, killed two [really big scary monsters - but I won't spoil the dungeon for you] by taking them one at a time, and generally had a good time. Players were all old hands at roleplaying, more or less disappointed with various 21st Century forms of D&amp;D, who looked at the dungeon crawl as a nice back-to-the-past experience - same as me, actually - and that's probably the best sort of crowd I could have wished for.<br/>Despite it being a really short dungeon crawl, I'm really satisfied with it and perhaps excessively pleased at myself, because everything went almost exactly as I'd hoped for. The character creation guide booklets I'd written just the day before the con worked fine and made character creation a breeze, including equipping. 20 minutes into the game, I think, we had a fully and functionally equipped party of 5, plus 3 NPC henchmen and 1 NPC guide, rolling their first Read a Sitch check to set up camp by the lakeside in the shadow of the spire. The magic-user shined without even casting his one spell (Summon Venusian Beast Companion) because he was allowed to detect magic at will (with a form of Read check, really). The specialists (a traps-and-locks kind of thief and a circus acrobat) got to do their things: scout ahead, check for traps, etc. The fighters got to ambush the first of two charging [REDACTED] making it trip on a length of rope and fall to the ground, and the henchmen helped in slaughtering it.<br/>I got a ton of useful data so I know I'll be improving on Perception checks, designing a different subsystem for trapfinding, re-introducing some form of "spite" damage for monsters and beefing up their Combat Rating.<br/><br/><b>Society of Dreamers</b>: I love this game! However, accepting to work on its Italian translation - released last year - came with the burden of a string of abridged convention demos, enticing to prospective buyers but ultimately unsatisfying to me.<br/>I though this time it would be different - I had secured two consecutive slots, six hours total, which ought to be enough for a full game. But it filled up to max capacity (5 players including me), we failed to start on time (morning game, supposed to start at 9:00, and we'd all had after-dinner games ending at midnight the night before) and the majority of the players had to run and catch a train before the afternoon slot was officially over... All things considered, we were reduced to about 4 hours and a half out of the 6 I'd planned - hardly enough time.<br/>To cut on the <i>pre-game</i> but not sacrifice any part of it, I decided not to make a character myself (character creation takes 2 scenes per character, so I reasoned I would save at least 20 minutes this way) but otherwise be an equal player. This plan perhaps backfired in that I ended up playing timidly, as a <i>less</i> than equal player, in order not to sound like a GM. When it seemed like one of the players - the one the least used to equal-participation RPGs I believe - was doing more than his share and hogging the spotlight a bit, out of genuine enthusiasm I've got to add, I didn't do as much as I could have done to reign him in, worried I would sound like a GM shutting him down.<br/>Enthusiasm for the setting and subject matter was generally high. I knew one of the players was a XIX Century buff already, but another one really surprised me by demonstrating <i>a lot</i> of knowledge about weird stuff. Unfortunately, some of the players were <i>really</i> bad at cutting scenes and (as <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> pointedly said above) at "letting time pass"... Those who were contributing the most content also contributed an endless amount of useless clutter on top of that (perhaps because they weren't very good at "giving in", or at letting go of previously held ideas) and kept adding more and more stuff to each scene. Thus, we were only able to play two scenes of Weaving (bad) - three scenes short of a full round - and had to rush it to an ending which didn't feel quite like an ending to me.<br/>What can I say, tho? It's no easy game, and everybody seemed to walk away quite satisfied, so I've at least shown them a little known gem of the form. I promised myself I'll only schedule it for fewer players and longer play-times from now on, however, so we can play more relaxedly and take breaks at appropriate times and take better care of each other.<br/> </div>

<b>Ryuutama</b> Naora and their goats are back, now exploring the first layer of the abyss. An adorable fox makes our acquaintance, and we debate using that as a gift for the dragon who guards the gate to the second layer (the dragon likes adorable animals). Then the meerkats attack, but fortunately Koji speaks squirrel and that's close enough. I love the mood even as the relentless churn of the system is a smidge annoying.<br/><br/><b>Monsterhearts</b> at the Meetup. It's the big dance! The Fae never wears a shirt, the Werewolf is sure that going as his date on a full moon will be fine, the Infernal has to deal with a sudden intervention/exorcism, and the Vampire gets a surprising revelation from the Dean. Madcap fun with a big table (6 players!) that I managed to somehow juggle into shape.<br/><br/><b>Monsterhearts: Kingsport '76</b> online at the Gauntlet: With the Deep One hybrid caught up in a sudden religious ceremony, we got to meet Billy the Mortal, a Leif Garrett-style would-be guitar god. The Witch discovered that having a wolf at her mind's door (result of a botched hex last session) was more than she bargained for, the Werewolf's cousin discussed why he's called Lobo, the Chosen pushed liao powder and had a strange conversation, and everyone was a bit disturbed by Jimmy the rather sinister/friendly preacher.

Lol.  I had the same experience with my first Torchbearer run.  My main criticism of the system is that it presents players with dozens of mechanical buttons and then is like "No don't press those buttons! Focus on what your character is doing."  Many of the mechanics (grind, tests, town phase) are designed to keep pressure on players rather than giving them tools to solve problems.  You need to grok these systems to play optimally (which is as much about choosing when to fail is it is about how to succeed) but you want your actions to be rooted in the fiction until the GM calls for a test, and then be strategic in how to respond.  I wish this was a smaller hurtle, since I think Torchbearer is really great once you're over it.  I hope you get the chance to play again!                        </div>

<b>Final NYC Torchbearer session:</b><br/><br/>Ruadri, Smorg, and Joggo ran into a new face below ground. An amnesiac warrior had gotten lost in the caves. He remembered a love of good pickles, but not his own name. Since he had stumbled down a hill of loose rocks into this chamber, the party dubbed him ‘Scree’.<br/><br/>The party's two dwarves spent days carving through a cave-in so we could get back to town.  Once back in the sunlight, our adventurers were ebullient. Joggo loaded the others into an old mine cart and pushed them most of the way back to town, shouting about the glory of Dwarven Halls all the way.<br/><br/>There had been a fire in the town market, so Joggo crafted the needed gear himself. Smorg couldn’t manage to sleep off his sickness in his family’s cramped quarters, so he went out looking for a dwarven witch. He came back with blood on his lips and his hair tousled (muttering about owing a debt) but he yet lives.  Joggo and Ruadri found a buyer for their dragon’s egg and did some research about the wizard they were tracking. The party set back out to find him, though Smorg and Joggo were stopped at the gates by debt collectors. Turns out that dragon egg money didn’t carry them as far as they had hoped.<br/><br/><i>Great conclusion to the campaign that was the highlight of my summer. Town phases can be a delicate balance between dry checklist and meandering distractions. Our GM did a great job of keeping to procedure but giving everything a distinct flavor. If he could earn embodiment for the dwarven witch that “helped” Smorg, he’d have my vote.</i> </div>

                            Just ran 2nd post-playtest session of Fate of Cthulhu, which wrapped the arc. <br/><br/>Among the many awesome moments by awesome players was when a situation had gone WAY bad and K8's player reminded Kate's player that she'd taken a defined-on-the-spot corruption stunt allowing her to rewind an action.<br/><br/>The Washington Monument did not get blown up (but apparently, every game I've been in where someone has a Secret HQ, it's somewhere inside the Washington Monument).<br/><br/>Sydney continued to run for State Senator of Maryland, on a platform of guns, SIM rights, and no technology, to which he added hand baked cupcakes. <br/><br/>Samson (working on his chronicle of the campaign): It was at this point the campaign decided to use tasty treats to lure in children.<br/><br/>Technically true, as Sydney was hoping to lure in Ith's evil timeline version.<br/><br/>Sydney then decided to run for president, and when he won, put his wife in charge of technology (which was not a bad move, as he's married to K8), remaining convinced that it would only take a short while to get rid of all the technology.<br/><br/>Somewhere in there, the main villain (Kate Beta) set a trap to kill Our Heroes. And then, Sydney's player said, in character, that the trap I described was there, sure, but there was also an antimatter bomb in the oven, so I figured that was there too, sure. And then K8's player decided that there had to be a third trap. I wondered if we were going to continue iterating, but I think only cupcakes got iterated.<br/><br/>K8 had Kate's railgun for some reason, I think intending to use it in disarming a trap by blowing up a wall (after being assured by Kate that it was on its low setting), but Ith dissolved the wall.<br/><br/>K8: So we don't have to use the railgun.<br/><br/>Kate (who knows herself): But you kind of want to use the rail gun.<br/><br/>K8: ... Here, take the railgun.<br/><br/>Kate: That's good, because I was lying about it having a low setting.<br/><br/>Sydney's version of what to say during an interview: I like guns. I like cupcakes. I'm an environmentalist. (Points to the bike he rode into DC on account of he wouldn't have been able to find parking for a car.)<br/><br/> </div>

                            Definitely not this week. Last month, simultaneous with the <i>Dog and Wolf</i> game I told y'all about <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/475345/#Comment_475345" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>We were on a 10-day seaside holiday w/family. Almost no Internet. I'd brought <i>The Hour Between Dog and Wolf</i> to play with Barbara (which means I'd brought two dozen d6s in two colors and a handful of glass bead tokens too), but no other games printed out. I had my battered old laptop with the usual 9GB library (and counting) of indie role-playing games in its hard-drive, of course. I was sort of bored, as I usually end up being in those circumstances as I dislike sunbathing and can't swim.<br/>We met some relatives of Barbara's, had quite a good time together, and for some reason one of them remembered about our role-playing hobby. She wasn't quite sure what it <i>is</i>, mind you, but she kept bringing up the topic, implying it might be something her 12yo granddaughter would enjoy. When this came up again during an evening of playing cards, I thought, why not, and broke out an impromptu all-family game of <b>Fables of Camelot</b>. I can run that game almost entirely from memory, you see, printed character sheets aren't really needed, and what little I didn't know by heart I could look up on the computer screen; plus, an adventure tends to be short.<br/>Different people had different reaction to that... In hindsight, they weren't a very cohesive group, and I would rather like to play different games with some of them (including the grandmother who was then rather sorry she'd "broken the game" - what she did would make excellent <i>Fiasco</i> or <i>Apocalypse World</i> material, actually). The aforementioned granddaughter obviously had a blast... and I had a blast, too. It was apparent to me she was <i>born</i> for this - and she asked for more.<br/><br/>And so it was that, for the remainder of the week, Barbara and I kept going on play-dates with this brilliant young relative. I offered those games I thought we could play with the (severely limited) available equipment, and we picked some based on topic, as usual. We had a really good game of <b>Follow</b>, the superheroes quest played out in a very X-men-ish way with perhaps a hint of Watchmen. I think the girl played a character straight from some favorite TV series of hers, but that worked like a charm. It ended in a <i>tragic</i> victory, built on a platform of death and lies, and our youngest player (hers was the only surviving main character) was quite mad at us for being mean - which, in all fairness, we are.<br/>Undeterred, we played <b>Microshock <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a></b> (aka <i>Altered Carbon</i> the RPG, or so I've been told). This was harder and more confusing - partly because Barbara and me hadn't played it before. Despite hiccups, we managed to weave a really nice Phillip K. Dick-esque story, ending in reveal and (of course) death, of sorts.<br/><br/>We definitely played with the girl as equals, <i>as she were an adult</i>, which isn't what we normally do (Barbara <i>works</i> with children that age, you see). We didn't just do it for a change, we did it because her brilliantness and enthusiasm invited it. Let's hope she won't hate us for it! <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>

                            Other Dust last night. Not bad but the system is a bit of a mish-mash. Far too many skills, most of which are unuseable. Also different bits of the system have different die rolls (like its a d20 system but the priority roll is a D8)- it needs to be unified.                        </div>

                            Torchbearer session last night was a bit of a challenge.  It was a first town phase for some players and we had a hard time switching back into fiction-first mode afterwards.  We did too much negotiation (around what skill was relevant, reasonable obstacles, etc) and some players wound up getting way less spotlight than others.  Too much time in the weeds of mechanics and I hardly got to see who the characters were.  We'll try fresh next time and then we are due for a winter phase.  Hopefully a session of characters swapping stories over the fire will reinvigorate us.                        </div>

                            Playtested my game Thornwood: School of Magic this week. Created characters, which was fairly quick but everyone seemed happy with how defined their characters were and we definitely ended up with three unique characters. It was a 2 hour playtest all told.<br/><br/>The characters bonded over preventing Rona's pet bird-dog from launching itself at another table, though Jonas got a bit scratched up in the process, Bryth was glad for the distraction from people asking questions about their burns.<br/><br/>They all get sorted into house Ash, associated with wild freedom.<br/><br/>Jonas' older brother is in his senior year and something of a troublemaker that smuggles banned items into Thornwood, so Jonas gets to work straight away on learning the skills necessary to become a valued member of the family smuggling ring. He starts learning a spell of invisibility, his initial experiments go awry though and people notice him more and more throughout the week. This comes to a head when Professor Splinterworth's attention is irresistibly drawn to Jonas as he is leaving class with a coat-full of illicit jinxes-in-a-jar. Luckily Rona is a bit klepto and is able to snatch the goods from him before ol' Splinty notices.<br/><br/>Bryth has an affinity for brooms, both their flying broom and the enchanted broom-people that are the caretakers of Thornwood Keep and the grounds. They decide to learn a summoning spell so that they can call their broom to their side at a moments notice. Being an intellectual sort, they are able to make good progress on the spell with no unfortunate side effects.<br/><br/>Rona, wild and free and enamoured with Roshy her little violent but cute bird-dog, decides to spend her first week at school planning and executing a break-in to the potions supply closet with her two new pals in order to procure some seeds that will turn the bird-dog into a living mood-ring that will change colours based on its emotions. They sneak in after classes end for the day and narrowly avoid getting discovered on their way there.<br/><br/>While there, Jonas asks Bryth if they know any plants that would produce a pleasant stupor, they don't but a quick (and risky if they read something wrong) perusal of some herbalism books points them toward something that will do the trick. Unfortunately it was also quite a conspicuous and rare plant, so the potions teacher is going to ramp up security and start an investigation for sure!<br/><br/>Overall it was an awesome playtest, nailed the feel of the game and pointed out a few things that needed improvement / thinking about.                         </div>

                            D&amp;D back after summer break! The Oracular Dice show their kind side to the players after several sessions of wandering Stonehell finding nothing but death and perplexion. They find a cache of 3,800gp and encounter a group of vengeful monsters (from a tribe the characters suspect looted the Imperial Tomb they opened earlier). Most of the party get to shine during the encounter:<br/><br/>The warrior-poet turned demon-samurai(poet) slay a couple together with his minions (losing 2 in the process)<br/><br/>The sumo wrestler catches a retreating monster with a net and pins it to the ground.<br/><br/>The prismatic wizard tortures their prisoner with blinding light and his radiant aura <i>Charms</i> it giving them almost perfect intelligence on the enemy (if not for their unstructured interrogation).<br/><br/>The next session will the exciting, the players have good and reliable information leading to a <b>great</b> treasure but it's guarded by tougher opposition than they've ever met before. They have lots of warm bodies to throw at the problem in the form of the demon-samurais minions, but the defensive position of their enemy means they'll be massacred unless expertly deployed.<br/><br/>Significant PC:<br/>4th level mage (as of this session)<br/>3rd level thief<br/>3rd level barber-surgeon<br/>3HD demon-samurai                        </div>

                            We wrapped up a game of <i>Tales of Entropy</i> which started last February (!!!), moving ever so slowly. It was a very interesting, diverse group of people, and, though it took us a long time to find our footing here and there, there were some excellent contributions from all.<br/><br/>A Renaissance-era merchant city with a deep history is turned upside down when a Dragon awakens and enters it in the shape of a man with golden-hair. At first, he is imprisoned, but he wins over his captors by opening the Moon Gate and showing the Inquisitor that magic is real, and part of his domain.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the scion of an ancient House secretly ruled by a mind flayer-esque "Patriarch" saves the life of a young boy, who becomes possessed by the Patriarch, and begins to turn into a dragon himself.<br/><br/>The city's social fabric is turned upside down and the Dragons rule together, the greed of the merchants leading them to ruin.                        </div>

That matches my own experience w/<i>Okult</i> bit by bit! This game by <a href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">@Wilhelm</a> Person ought to see more play.<br/><small>I actually believe the reason we don't get to talk about it much is, it's both such a good game and so streamlined already, nobody's tinkering with it, either to fix it or hack it - it's perfect already.

                            We had a second world-building session of <b>Archipelago</b> that we're playing online. We've made a super fun Miyazaki-style Europe a la Porco Rosso / Castle Cagliostro. Last session we started making our characters: a runaway princess who wants to become a pilot, a young mechanic who wants to see the world through his camera lens, and a lonely railway conductor looking for happiness.<br/><br/>It's exciting to be playing a multi-session game again--I haven't done that in ages!                        </div>

                            Chiarina, glad you liked it. Yes, I plan 3x4h sessions for OKULT, but 2x6 sounds nice too.<br/><br/>I've kept playing both the PbP Until Dawn and Burning Empires. Slow but steady. <br/><br/>This evening I playtested a friend's boardgame/RPG hybrid Our Ship. It worked much better in practice than I had guessed from his description of it last week. Would play again.                         </div>

                            Ran the first session of Our Ladies of Sorrow, part 2, shifted from CoC to ToC and from 2009 to 1967.  The hook was also reconstructed, and this turned into me taking the scenario apart like a bunch of blocks and seeing which bits I could rebuild for this run, this group.<br/><br/>This involved giving giving three of the four PCs a personal connection to folks who'd gone missing, and some scribbles about who mapped onto whom of the scenario's missing folks.<br/><br/>When folks came over, the player of the fourth PC pointed out that his PC could have a niece or nephew among the missing, something I'd considered but discarded because I'd been under the impression he wasn't interested in that kind of hook. (Example one gazillion and twenty-three of why it is useful to, y'know, talk to people.)<br/><br/>So, I looked at my list of unassigned missing folks, trying to figure out which one to map the niece onto when another player pointed out that the niece could also be the NPC another PC cared about for completely different reasons. Yep, CLICK.                        </div>

                            Since last time:<br/><br/><b>Monsterhearts 2</b>: two sessions at the Meetup. One was a monster of the week type episode, as an NPC fae from the court of the Fae Queen arrived in town to stir things up and ended up being brutally killed by the Chosen in the Mortal's bathroom. The Mortal has switched her true love to the Chosen now, natch. Second session saw the evil god Sergei turn up the heat, the Chosen kill one of his cultists and given three days to do something about Sergei by a witch who works for the Massachusetts State Police, and a very annoyed dissident Deep One drop by the Queen to do his bidding (sort of).<br/><br/><b>Trail of Cthulhu</b>, Our Ladies of Sorrow: Joyce seems to have finally found some stability, running a ratty talent booking agency and flying charters with her girlfriend in a refurbished C-47. So of course Martin and Jeremiah show up with Isidore in tow, looking for their missing adopted Korean son in the Arizona desert. It doesn't help that one of the missing kids is Lothlorien, the girlfriend of Joyce's would-be protege. More fun 1960s-era investigation with Lisa Padol.<br/><br/><b>Dialect</b>: The Ark is a dissident community deep in the woods of Washington State, run by elder Columbine Tortoise (Jenny) who is trying to groom Clover Hare to be part of the new leadership. But when Honeysuckle Orca (or "effing Frank" as Jenny calls him) gets sick, Brown Bear brings a doctor to the compound and the outside world intrudes. A lovely little tale of the collapse of beautiful dreams into tawdry merchandising.<br/><br/><b>Nerves of Steel</b>: Harry Clover is a tough PI, in deep to the gangster known as the Eagle, who gets hired by the lovely jazz singer Colleen Bind. She's getting threatening letters in the mail and wants Harry to find out what's going on. But things are not what they seem; a body is left in Harry's office, Colleen is hiding the man she was supposed to have killed, and the Eagle is pulling everyone's strings. It all ends in murder, and Harry walking sorrowfully off in the rain. There's no luck in this city. A really fun game of our own Simon Petersson's excellent noir story game.<br/><br/><b>Monsterhearts 2: Kingsport 1692</b>, online at the Gauntlet: The first chapter of the new Kingsport series, Monsterhearts set in Lovecraft Country. The girls of Kingsport are a diverse bunch: Chastity is the "niece" of a war hero and the spitting image of her mother (and no one knows exactly who her parents are); Mercy is from the fishing Pembleton family who seem to like the water just a bit too much; Aphra is dead but nobody's noticed yet; Verity sometimes roams the woods as a red-haired wolf; and Fortune has just arrived from Salem Village with rumors of witchcraft following behind. (Our Hollow, Serpentine/Deep One, Ghost, Werewolf, and Witch). Strange things are happening: Aphra's father wants to return to England to lay her to rest; a sexy woodcutter named Fear-the-Lord Woode arrives in town; and Grace Baxter suffers horrible fits and cries out that a crone oppresses her. This is going to be lovely, especially Fortune, who seems to be here to sleep with half the cast and mess with everyone else <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> </div>

                            Another session of my home game of Torchbearer.  This one was a high water mark.  Players hit a stride in system mastery and really engaged with some of the decision points that emerge from the crunch.  Earned a ton of checks by playing up their complex personalities, and spent all their rewards to win two big conflicts.<br/><br/>Over the course of the session, they became more sympathetic to the pirate town they went into raid.  We ended with a 'convince crowd' conflict to get the townspeople (and the adventurers' blood-thirsty allies) to lay down arms.  The refugees from the pirate village (who were caught up in a bigger conflict) will be able to settle in the abandoned fort the adventurers cleared in their last adventure.<br/><br/>My favorite moment was much more mundane.  We were out of rations and fresh water.  One adventurer was still hungry and thirsty and all they had was a bottle of mysterious fluid (smelling like sweet, spiced seawater).  Do they drink it and suffer unknown effects?  Spend precious turns on the grind studying it?  Leave it alone until town phase and enter a fight on an empty stomach?  The players had all the info to make the decision (besides what the liquid does) because the relevant factors (time, thirst, and lore mastery) are all baked into the system, so I could sit back and enjoy, awaiting their decision.                        </div>

                            1001 Nights: We spur-of-the-moment hacked it to be about a faery court. Our characters were a rabbit's ghost that wanted to to die in peace,  the mortal musician/ex-lover of the Faerie Queen who wanted the apples of immortality, a faerie executioner who wanted something that I forget, a faerie serving girl who wanted the rabbit to stay in the court, a trapped mortal sandal weaver who wanted to see his family again, and a magic bird that wanted to burn things.<br/><br/>The setting was really cool, but we never successfully defined the faery court or decided what storytelling conventions we were drawing on.<br/><br/>The game itself went off the rails a bit -- we got stuck in a sprawling story where we recounted the thousand-years history of a vampire (featuring appearances by his twin brother; his twin brother's vampire hunter lover, the two blokes who fell in love and then died pointlessly after getting turned into vampires on a moon base; the vampire's virgin sacrifice; and his virgin sacrifice's fairy servant).<br/><br/>My personal theory is that this was a Faerie Court that heard of Twilight and Heinlein and then got really, really confused.<br/><br/>The winner was the stolen mortal weaver -- he didn't win his freedom, but he did find a magic mirror in the garden that let him see his family.<br/><br/>I'd like to play fairy court 1001 Nights again, with more attention to the rules and a more defined setting and story tropes to draw on (a mix of Shakespeare and fairy tales!). This has also spurred some interest in our group for hacking 1001 Nights to other settings (kids telling urban legends around a fire? Decameron?).                        </div>

<b>Starfinder</b> - finished book 4 of their first adventure path. Still amused that the young play qualifies the play in a post-apocalyptic settings as "like Fallout". Guess every new generation has their touchstones.<br/><br/><b>City of Mist</b> - Did character generation for a small group that has been historically resistant to overtures of PbtA games. The recalcitrant player was out, and the others seem interested, as they are big on noir-ish and investigative play. They made a waitress who was the incarnation of Bonnie (of Bonnie &amp; Clyde), and an academic who was an incarnation of Thoth.<br/><br/><b>Pathfinder</b> - Ran a final session of a campaign I had grown impatient with.

                            I ran my "Exit Plan" adventure for <b>Cepheus Engine</b> (SRD Traveller), set in my MAIN SEQUENCE original setting. It's a <i>Mission Impossible</i>-type adventure where there's a lot that goes wrong for a special ops / intelligence team trying to steal/sabotage a rival noble house's space program.<br/><br/>It was the first time I ran it, and I wanted to try it out before I take it to TravellerCon/USA, where the grognards are. It went pretty well but the playtest data will make it much better.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I'll barely have time to write the second adventure I'm running at TravellerCon, let alone playtest it.                         </div>

                            playtest of “to delete press three”. A game of asynchronous voice messaging in the days before cellphones.   It worked very nicely, but the real delight of the evening was when we finished the first game then tried one of the barely fleshed out variant modes. We came up with some new mechanics and played out a love triangle: two players, three characters. <br/>Josh and Rob (identical twins) are cheering each other on and supporting each other through some rough relationship issues. They’ve both found new loves. They are both dating women named Peggy. Peggy is working hard to juggle the two without them learning of her “twin relationships”   Oops, but now Peggy is pregnant!  Whose the daddy?  We will never know.                         </div>

                            Torchbearer One-Shot:<br/><br/>GM’ed for a group of players that all knew Torchbearer well (each had between 5 sessions and 5 years of experience).  I was sort of a guest GM in an ongoing campaign.  7 Players, 6 hours (with a long break). I couldn’t believe how well the system supported a large party.  Torchbearer is complicated enough that I wouldn’t want to teach that many people at once, but with everyone invested in the campaign and familiar with the rules, it was a hoot.<br/><br/>Ran one of <a href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">@Fuseboy</a> 's adventures, with small modifications.  A local young noble had run off to a healing temple to find a cure for his ailing father.  The father had died and the son had gone missing.  The mother, now ruling the small holding, put a bounty on her son’s safe return.<br/><br/>The party cut a swath across the island, facing off with Harpies, Spiders, and Ghosts.  One of the party fell 100’ feet down a hole into a pitch black, flooded chamber.  It was very satisfying to bring in big twists, knowing that a large party could handle it.  One interesting thing to discover was that big encounters pay off for a big party.  They can handle serious opposition with 4-6 helping die on each action, and they need those huge loot rolls from facing something tough.                        </div>

                            GM'd the first session of the third season of our Dungeon World campaign last night. <br/><br/>During session zero we had decided to move the story a hundred years into the future after one of the heroes broke Death's Black Gates and the world is a post-apocalyptic bleak place filled with undead and ghosts. It was fun to see the players going for really different characters this time around. To help put some real relations in play from the outset I'd also busted out the Dragon Slayers Fiasco playset to trigger some ideas of how they knew each other, instead of the previous "murder hobos who just happen to be on a similar course". This worked surprisingly well. So the cast consists of a dementia-ridden old human thief and owner of a flop house who is the adoptive mother of the huge dog man truth seeking paladin who in turn has taken in a 12 year old human street urchin with a secret (that she is a wizard, they're blamed for the breaking of Deaths doors). We also have the Thief's old lover, an elven death cleric from out of the far west, looking to help all ghosts pass through the gates, and his dracoman cronie, a branded small dragonman looking for a way back to it's plane who in the meantime takes on the demeaning task of burning zombies and other animated dead. Who also is responsible for the kid's burn scars in an accident a few years back.<br/><br/>Episode one saw the heroes being tasked with clearing out the ghosts from a wealthy town house of the Cochon-family and they set to with gusto. I'd not played any RPGs since May but we quickly worked through the cobwebs and they managed to fight both the reanimated unicorn skeleton in the barn and the ghost in the well (totally not a pun in Swedish, I just saw it now) without the dracoman burning down more than the old stables. They also figured out that the Cochon's had been wizards and the child accidentally blew her secret too.<br/><br/>I also tried the oracle idea I'd seen somewhere on these forums I believe, but it didn't really work out. Nevertheless it was satisfyingly fun to return to our mangled fantasy world.                        </div>

<b>Starfinder </b>- Probably the most tactical session I have run in a long time, mostly owing to the fact that I was raiding the PCs ship and the villains were using cover. After the 5th or 6th "missed by the margin of cover, hit because he was entangled, etc.", the players started to catch on to the idea they needed to use terrain to their advantage.<br/><br/><b>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</b> - Ran a somewhat cliche scenario out of one of the villain books. The heroes stumble upon villains playing the "faux victim" card from manufactured enemies, which the players caught onto immediately. Still had fun on strength of interesting NPCs and a tense final throw-down.<br/><br/><b>Scum &amp; Villainy </b>- Finally got to run this. Ran 5 players with the starter Stardancer (Firefly-mode) starter scenario; It honestly wasn't that different from similar scenarios I have run recently in Bulldogs (Fate Core) and Traveller, though I did like the contributions of heritage, background, and vices give to the character personalities.<br/><br/>Sat down afterwords and brainstormed character ideas for <b>City of Mist</b>. One of the players really seemed to struggle with character ideas. I told her she could run the pregen she seemed to enjoy in the one shot. I'm glad she didn't follow that advice, as the powered through and came up with the idea of making a psychologist who was the manifestation of the Baku, a Japanese mythological creature that consumes nightmares.                        </div>

                            It’s come up to the time in class to play the <b>Carebear Friendship Game</b> I hacked together. But this time, it’s with six kids instead of the typical one to three kids I usually get to teach. That, combined with some of them being very unruly and the game having a bit of a dice pool mechanic had made me worry that it would be an entire hard thing and that I would have had to go and retrieve my dice from the ends of the earth. But they behaved well, and it went okay.<br/><br/>It went like this, the Carebears Mimi, Lili, Lala, Troetelmatthew, Anton and one other who’s name I can’t remember had come to the home of one of them after church with the promise of cake and hot chocolate, but, oh disaster! Mommy-bear had fallen ill! What would they do now?<br/><br/>First, they tried to work together to find out what the illness was, but even when working together, they could not do that. One of them called the doctor (They named him doctor Apple) while the others started to make the cake anyway, using teamwork, since everything had been set out to make it before mom fell ill. The doctor came and found out that all mom would need to heal was a nice, big slice of chocolate-vanilla cake. And wouldn’t you know? That’s the cake they had just made! What a nice ending! After this, I told the story that the lesson was about, which is how Jesus and His friends went to Peter’s place after Synagogue and where Peter asked Jesus to heal his stephmom, who had fallen ill with fever.<br/><br/>Two more ‘friendship’ stories will be seen next week, so I’ll share those next week, if all goes well.<br/>I’ll try to get some pictures for that one maybe <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            We played out our first Winter Phase in Torchbearer; I loved it!<br/><br/>Every adventure in Torchbearer lasts a season.  After three seasons, you have a winter phase.  Players take turn choosing a new "wise": an area of expertise they've developed in the past year.  Then they take turns telling in-character fireside tales about each other's characters.  At the end of the story, the storyteller nominates that character for a new trait.  If the table agrees, then they take the trait.<br/><br/>They great part about this is how characters that might start as stock fantasy get a little stranger and more original.<br/><br/>Our tough-talking halfing is now "ugly truth-wise" and Lyrical. One session he made a goal to get a sea shanty written about him (a comically unlikely goal for Torchbearer).  Now his love of music is built into his character.<br/><br/>Our loyal cleric who had never passed a resource test in town is now merchant-wise (and steadfast).<br/><br/>I mostly enjoyed how different it was from the rest of the system.  We're going back out into an indifferent would with a much better sense of the characters at our table.                        </div>

<i><b>Ribbon Drive: Radion Accelerator Drive</b></i>. The Fine Line is an unusual, experimental ship - probably the only Imperial interstellar ship which is <i>small</i> and can be operated by a crew of a handful. Still, like all Imperial interstellar ships it runs on an <i>Anima</i>: a live human Oracle (telepath) permanently plugged into the main computer, apparently in a vegetative state - her name is Tara, by the way.<br/>After <b>Rainbow</b>, our clueless civilian contacts guy/quartermaster/smuggler with a heart of gold found out about the Anima, my character <b>Yama</b> - the sketchy and possibly fake Imperial envoy and Vajrayana monk - gave up on his hope of finding an effective way of <i>talking</i> to her. That happened while our medic/mechanic/cyber-scientist <b>Hari</b> drunk himself into a stupor on a frontier planet and realized he'll never be OK, 'cause you can't fix the past. At least, now Rainbow had learned who he was traveling with!<br/>On our way there, though, we'd managed to smuggle away a handful of really-in-a-bad-shape Imperial soldiers from a secret mining outpost on an environmentally harsh satellite - which hadn't been shut off even after most troopers turned all crazy cannibal-zombie on their comrades, because apparently the mineral they were trying to extract is just too valuable. We eventually entrusted them to Cowboy Iago, a super-wealthy drug-lord who promised to care for them and any other sane survivors in exchange for directions to the top-secret mines, may he profit insanely for extracting the stuff himself!<br/>And may we succeed at dismantling the tyranny of the Empire from within and pierce the veil of superstition and false religion numbing her peoples' minds, and may Rainbow eventually find out what to life for, as well.<br/>(Theme song is <i>Innuendo</i> by Queen.

                            Even though we're done playtesting my Heavy Metal inspired King Machine, we seem to keep playing it! Our heroes, a gorilla military lawyer, a bonobo MASH surgeon, and a capuchin treasure hunter, scaled the frozen waterfall connecting two flying mountains in search of the Gravity Bomb that they lost when they fell from their makeshift parachute. Unfortunately, waiting at the top for them were a few chimpanzee raiders from the Royal Scouts. Bluffing almost works, though there was an accidental death in the process as the MASH surgeon fled on one of the Scouts' war kites.<br/><br/>He returned, though, to scoop up his pals and crash them into a platoon of local militia that did find the Gravity Bomb!                        </div>

Isidore's player deliberately didn't want to fill the holes in Isidore's memory in the 1963 arc, pretty much saying he was holding out for more poisoned apples, so I found a way to make the holes a bit bigger and put more stuff into them.<br/><br/>Those heart-to-hearts aren't limited to the 1960s. Joyce and Martin had them in the 1930s as well. The latest does seem to have a note of urgency, though.<br/><br/>The thing that's easy to forget about Jeremiah because he's so very easy going is that when he thinks it's time to do something drastic, there's no hesitation. Even after Crescent City / Asylum, I was surprised that he was the first to fire a shot in 1963. It made all kinds of sense, of course.<br/><br/>The desert wizard's personality may have shifted in play, as I got surprised. There are several ways to go Somewhere Else in the scenario, which is one of its strong points, and the default regarding the wizard is that he comes to you after a couple of days. But you guys went to him, and it was so very clear that it was no one's first rodeo.<br/><br/>Joyce: Let's just pretend we did the whole I-threaten-you you-threaten-me bit.<br/><br/>Desert Wizard: I'd already pretended that.<br/><br/>Joyce: Oh good. I'll get the next round.<br/> </div>

<b>S03E02 - Skeletons in the closet</b><br/>We had our second session of the third season of the Dungeon World campaign. Only three of the players could join but we continued where we’d left off in the haunted mansion. The Oracle gave us <i>Kindness</i>, <i>Spring</i> and <i>Royalty</i> which felt kind of impossible, considering it was autumn in an empty haunted city. They managed to break into the house and where surrounded by ghosts. “Are they ghost children?” one of the players asked so naturally they were. And they were tormented by the spectre of their tormentor in life, old man Cochon. The heroes fought the monster heroically, but urged by the death cleric the ghost children finished it off. Then the cleric helped their souls through Death’s doors (Kindness). Having exorcised the mansion they uncovered that the Cochon family most probably had killed their evil patriarch and left when the Black Gate had been broken, sealing the mansion with magic. After spending an uneventful night their employer Mr Cochon arrived together with their hometown’s richest merchant and de facto ruler Guillaume Le Gros (Royalty). The heroes gauged wether Cochon knew about the patriarchs atrocities, but he was young and clueless. Apparently there was supposed to be a family treasure in the basement Cochon had offered up to Guillaume to settle his debts. The heroes and Cochon found the secret basement entrance and went down, on the way avoiding a trap. Cochon then gave some blood to open the vault revealing the treasure to be a collection of magical books. The cleric’s trouble greed struck and he scared Cochon with a show of darkness and death. The poor pig dwarf ran up the stairs, straight into the spring loaded trap (Spring). Now they have the books, but they will somehow have to explain away the “accident” to Guillaume who is waiting outside while saddled with a paladin who cannot lie.<br/><br/>Exchanging bonds for drives and troubles and running an oracle seems like it fits our group like a hand in glove. Also, it keeps my prep to a minimum which fits well with my current load at work.<br/> </div>

It's something I've been curious about for quite some time, but never actually done.<br/><br/>Would you consider starting a thread (or contributing to one) about best practices, observations, and advice for playing Monsterhearts in a historical setting?<br/><br/>How does one retain a personal connection with the characters and their family/school/life as it becomes more and more removed from our own high school experiences, for instance?                        </div>

<b>Monsterhearts:</b> This game was a glorious trainwreck-- four of us went into our Darkest Selves, and the Infernal and I are both doing parallel dark tragic arcs in which we lose everything for love. (Love and family seem to be the Themes of this game).<br/><br/>All my Vampire Amanda wanted to do protect her great-great granddaughter Alice, but then the Infernal slept with the man she'd hypnotized into believing he was her uncle and brought him under the control of the Dark Power. Then one thing led to another and she shot the Hollow and the Infernal and killed her "uncle", the Infernal's crush. Then the Infernal framed her for the mysterious drownings around the sea.<br/><br/>Our session ended with her vampire nemesis, the Mortal, the werewolf, the Hollow, and the werewolf's wolf sister ganging up to kill her. Meanwhile, the Infernal drowned her great-great granddaughter at the bidding of the Dark Power, who wants the Infernal to get rid of Amanda and kill everyone she has ever loved.<br/><br/>She's all set to snap out of her Darkest Self as soon as she finds out what happened to her descendant, but that won't stop the fact that the Hollow and the Infernal want to kill her. The Mortal's still in love with her vampire nemesis, and the Werewolf probably will want to kill her too once he realizes that she unhinged his wolf sister's mind during the fight.<br/><br/>Oh, and the Hollow and the Werewolf slept together. While he was a wolf.<br/><br/>We also dropped Shakespeare references (the Dark Power is Ophelia, who drowns people, and several of the characters are members of the drama club). And it does feel like we're moving to a Shakespearean bloodbath.                        </div>

<b>Carebears with 7 year olds, session 2.</b><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mechanics talk:</span> This is the first year that I have the kids do multiple sessions with this game, so we did a bit of a level up to start. They could either upgrade their talent or gain a new talent. So far, only one kid seemed to grasp that rolling six dice because you use your talent is better than using four dice for not using the talent. All in all, working together still is more rewarding. So that is still good, since it’s about the benefits of teamwork. This game though, was about the value of listening instead of working, when someone gives you good advice. This was rewarded with the characters listening to the advicegiver getting a free level up at the end of the game. Also worth noting, we had a seventh guest player, a 10 year old, who’s teacher couldn’t be at school, so I had to take care of him as well that hour. He played one of the example characters.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Game</span>: Unexpectedly, a professional soccer player came to the house of one of the characters, but they had just had a party the day before! Everything was dirty. What were they going to do, listen to sport advice or something else? At first they worked together to clean up at least a place to sit. (partial success) And afterwards a few kept cleaning while the others sat and listened. It occurs to me now that I should have asked how it made the working characters feel that the others weren’t helping. But I’ll write that out for next year. Afterwards, those who listened got either an advancement in a sport related talent (4 of the 6 characters have sport related talents) or gain a sport related talent of their own choosing. Then we went on to the bible story, which was Mary and Martha, and how it was more valuable to listen to Jesus while he was there than to clean the house, which you can do whenever. So far, these games/story matchups have been exactly long enough each time (which is to say, about half an hour, maybe a bit more.)<br/><br/>PS: I hope this isn’t too long a post.                        </div>

No problem at all! And not offensive either <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I’m way past the evangelical reflex of expecting everyone to believe the same as me wherever I post. Glad to be an inspiration. Gaming with kids is interesting, and different to design for, as the roots of the hobby lie more in doing ‘bad things’ (stealing and/or murdering for XP and loot), even though it’s usually done to bad creatures. You don’t want kids to start thinking even more on solving problems through violence imo. Empathy, intelligence and thinking out of the box are the things I wanna encourage kids to do/learn/experiment with. Also, I really only have time to play with kids in my class, so that’s why I only have these stories to tell. Otherwise I’d have other stories as well. I mean, I just thought up today how fun it would be to play a sort of Police Academy game using RISUS or Roll For Shoes. And who knows, maybe one time!

Cool! I’m interested! If you’d start a thread about how you do it or have a blog about it, I’d follow it!<br/>My own approach would be to use a Fall of Magic kind of travelling game.<br/><br/> </div>

                            More playtesting of <i>Soft Horizon</i>, this time starting work on issue two: <i>Sand Dogs</i>. This game changes up character creation with a simple life path technology so we tested that and revised a bunch of the text. Got two cool characters though! One a politician turned criminal who then tried to go straight as an EMT. The other a reluctant business exec following their father's footsteps but instead finding more satisfaction on the factory floor fabricating auto parts for 1920-era armoured cars.                        </div>

                            Two years ago, we started a Monsterhearts campaign, using the 1.5 rules.<br/><br/>One year ago, we reached the endpoint, i.e., the session after the Season Advances were unlocked.<br/><br/>We then played other things. Lots of other things.<br/><br/>Last night, we did the Season 2 pre-opening session, i.e., where we figure out who's playing whom, what's changed, where we pick up, all that, using the 2nd edition rules. This involved consensus, some house rulings, a fair bit of winging it, and a realization or two.<br/><br/>The Werewolf is now the Infernal, having fallen under a demon's sway last season.<br/><br/>The Queen is now the Serpentine, having grown up a bit and wanting to make a bit of space for herself. (The PC is basically a dragon princess from Seanan McGuire's InCryptid books, with a bunch of details changed.)<br/><br/>The Witch is still the Witch, although the player considered switching to the Hollow skin. (He went out of town for the spring semester and the summer to learn more about his power, hoping to be able to defeat the demon, and started in England, but when that "didn't meet his occult needs", wound up in Denmark. The Hollow would have been an "I don't fit in any more -- how do I cope with this?" take on things.)<br/><br/>The Fae's player decided that the Fae has retired to co-rule the Fae realm, and has created a new character, the Ghost. Not wanting the Ghost to be all about "who killed me?", the player decided the Ghost knew. (It was the Werewolf/Infernal, in an accident -- both are in the demon's gang, and there was a fight between gangs (and between seasons), and stuff got messy. The Ghost figures the Infernal owes him one, but is otherwise cool with the Infernal.)<br/><br/>While porting the Werewolf and Queen to the new skins, we decided:<br/><br/>* The Queen/Serpentine had 5 Advances last season.<br/>* The Witch and Werewolf/Infernal had... less, so should take enough Moves/Advances (I forget whether we limited it to Moves or not) to bring them up to 4, as it's okay if one PC is slightly more powerful than the others, but this should not be overwhelmingly more powerful.<br/>* The Ghost is a new PC, so can be slightly less powerful, but again, should not be overwhelmingly so, so started with 3 extra Moves/Advances (2 of which came from the Mortal skin, as we figure the Ghost probably started off life as a Mortal)<br/><br/>Realization someone made: The Ghost exits Darkest Self when "someone acknowledges your presence and demonstrates how much they want you around" -- "how much" could be "not at all" or "very little". I am fond of this interpretation as one reason I've never played the Ghost is my, quite possibly mistaken, belief that the Ghost has the most frustrating Darkest Self to play and the hardest to get out of.<br/><br/>House rule: We're renaming the "Sex Move" as an "Intimacy Move". We like the Asexuality rules, but as one player noted, while these are great safety tools, they're not so good if you want to play someone who's asexual in a teenage messy way. (Amusingly, this may wind up having no real effect on the game, but it makes us all a lot more comfortable.)<br/><br/>House rule / Weird thing we agreed on: One of the extra advances for the Werewolf/Infernal is that she has two Darkest Self possibilities. When the Dark Power gets 5 Strings on her, yes, absolutely, that's the Infernal's Darkest Self. But, she can also go Werewolf Darkest Self. And oh yes, she's taken Unstable.<br/><br/>Logical character arcs are fairly clear (regardless of whether or not they happen). The Witch wants to figure out where he fits in (especially as his parents are now divorced and his mother is three towns over) and to get the demon out of his town. The Serpentine wants to figure out who she is and get some breathing space from her family (she's taking her human cues from the Ghost). The Ghost wants to get to the Afterlife -- clearly, something other than having been killed is keeping him here, since he knows who killed him and how that all went on, and has forgiven the Infernal. The Infernal wants to figure out who she is, as last year, the Queen/Serpentine tried to get her to understand that she's not really a wolf. (She was raised by wolves, for Reasons, and doesn't physically transform at all.)<br/><br/>Interesting Not An Arc: Given that the Fae has retired, the whole fae realms business from last year should not be an arc. I mean, sure, stuff may happen that stirs it all up -- I have no idea, because Keep It Feral -- but my basic "here's stuff that could happen" pile shouldn't really have fae stuff in it. That's not where the interest is among the players.<br/><br/>Also, if I keep to this unless players nudge things towards the fae, it will keep me from doing the Lazy Thing, and for me, going "urban fantasy, there's this whole seelie-unseelie stuff going on" is the Lazy Thing.                        </div>

                            Our Dungeon World campaign continued. This time the oracle gave us: <i>Birth, Drugs, Rails</i> which again seemed impossible.<br/><br/><b>S03E03 - Feliz navidad</b><br/>The heroes managed to fool Guillaume the merchant prince/mobster boss that the exquisite collection of torture tools that had belonged to old man Cochon was the promised treasure but he was in no way ignorant of what kind of "accident" had happened to the young Cochon. In addition an altercation with the young wizard Agata lead to the Paladin owing Guillaume a sworn favor which could spell trouble for the future.<br/><br/>The other character's rounded on Agata's magic use but it turned out that none of them actually had any problem with wizards, except maybe the paladin. But he'd turn a blind eye as she's his ward.<br/><br/>Instead of returning to their home village of Mômeaux by the circuitous route they had entered the haunted city Agata managed to persuade them to take the straightest route. That would bring them straight to her old orphanage where she also made them promise to help her have her revenge on the evil staff.<br/><br/>On their way eastward they had a run-in with some skeleton city guards. They took some beating but the memorable part was when Agata accidentally ripped open the fabric of reality with her magic. Out fell a Blemmye, a headless person, from another plane. (This was a throwback to the adventures on that specific plane in season two). They destroyed the skeletons and took the dazed Blemmye with them. At nightfall they took shelter in an old warehouse which had had dreamweed as it's stock (Drugs). During the night the Blemmye gave birth to two identical babies out of it's stomach mouth (Birth) and the paladin reinforced his decision to help them reach safety.<br/><br/>The next day they found the way east easy enough, just follow the strange and straight rusted tracks (Rails) that runs out into the eastern reaches of the city (actually these where put there during world building, but I'd totally forgotten). When the elf's incompetence led them right into a dryad trap they got a chance to show their tree-felling skills.<br/><br/>Yet again we managed to heed the oracle, even though it seemed impossible on the outset. Also, I think I managed to get the fight scenes to snowball better, allowing for a more engaging fiction. I guess it's like they say: Practice makes if not perfect, at least better.                        </div>

                            Wednesday, I helped my wife GM a game of 4th edition D&amp;D for a crowd of 10-11 year olds. That's a chaotic, noisy game, but it's very cool to see how excited the kids get about things. And how different gaming styles emerge almost immediately in play: One guy has a complex, epic revenge backstory he doesn't want to share with anyone. One wants to build connections between all the characters. One just wants their character to act as comic relief, basically.<br/><br/>Friday, we playtested a new one-page scenario for a horror game that I'd written a long time ago. That game continues to spontaneously make spooky, nightmarelike horror stories unlike anything I've seen in any other RPG, which I really like. In this case, we started with the prompt I had written about sleep paralysis, but wound up discovering that we were dead the entire time (which was not something I expected when writing the prompt).<br/><br/>Then Saturday, we played an underwater dungeon in a friend's West Marches style D&amp;D game. My pirate paladin's swim speed was less useful than I would have expected.                        </div>

                            I ran a session of <b>psi*run</b> with my students. Again, they love it. I always used this game as a one-shot, but now we will try out the original 2-session concept.<br/><br/>Also I showed them <b>Follow.</b> Somehow it clicked for us. I think we were too cooperative at the first time with my friends, so the result was sort of boring.<br/><br/><b>No boundaries</b> looks good on paper, I like the rules of this freeform game, but in practice it was dull. Even with experienced Fiasco players...<br/><br/> </div>

                            I'm playing the "I gotta prep a Paris adventure for my Kerberos Fate game on Tuesday, and it's in wrap up mode" game. I found a Space 1889 I can modify, but I need to figure out what to make the opera singer instead of Martian (it's a plot point that there's a conspiracy called something like Patriots of Terra that don't want aliens on Earth, and Martians aren't yet a thing in the Kerberos game I'm running). I can stretch a point and use the Fae, but it's very much a lazy, sloppy way out.                        </div>

                            Great stuff. Ironjens, have you written about how you use that oracle? How does it become a group challenge to get those into play? Do you brainstorm upfront all together, or what?<br/><br/>NickWedig, have you posted about this horrible game before? It sounds very interesting.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, I'm preparing to start a game of Tales of Entropy this evening. This should be interesting! Our setup is somewhat inspired by Stranger Things (the Netflix show), although a little more twisted (as things tend to go with gamers). The Doctor in charge of the secret government facility is a former Nazi war criminal, for instance. I'm very curious to see if he will turn out to be pure evil or if he will find redemption (Tales of Entropy forces you to confront such questions quite a fair bit.)                         </div>

The Fine Line is an unusual, experimental ship - probably the only Imperial interstellar ship which is <i>small</i> and can be operated by a crew of a handful. Still, like all Imperial interstellar ships it runs on an <i>Anima</i>: a live human Oracle (telepath) permanently plugged into the main computer, apparently in a vegetative state - her name is Tara, by the way.<br/>After <b>Rainbow</b>, our clueless civilian contacts guy/quartermaster/smuggler with a heart of gold found out about the Anima, my character <b>Yama</b> - the sketchy and possibly fake Imperial envoy and Vajrayana monk - gave up on his hope of finding an effective way of <i>talking</i> to her. That happened while our medic/mechanic/cyber-scientist <b>Hari</b> drunk himself into a stupor on a frontier planet and realized he'll never be OK, 'cause you can't fix the past. At least, now Rainbow had learned who he was traveling with!<br/>On our way there, though, we'd managed to smuggle away a handful of really-in-a-bad-shape Imperial soldiers from a secret mining outpost on an environmentally harsh satellite - which hadn't been shut off even after most troopers turned all crazy cannibal-zombie on their comrades, because apparently the mineral they were trying to extract is just too valuable. We eventually entrusted them to Cowboy Iago, a super-wealthy drug-lord who promised to care for them and any other sane survivors in exchange for directions to the top-secret mines, may he profit insanely for extracting the stuff himself!<br/>And may we succeed at dismantling the tyranny of the Empire from within and pierce the veil of superstition and false religion numbing her peoples' minds, and may Rainbow eventually find out what to life for, as well.<br/>(Theme song is <i>Innuendo</i> by Queen. The Job score started with <i>Veteran of the Psychic Wars</i> by Blue Oyster Cult. Lots of much weirder stuff in our playlists.)<br/><br/>Also, I think I owe y'all about 1-2 months worth of games I've played but not told you about.</p></div></blockquote>
Episode 2 of the above, in which a Job playlist starting with Stayin' Alive by Bee Gees had us pick up the sole survivor (plus cargo) from a rebel trader and deliver him to the local rebellion's secret base, while eluding pursuit from an imperial warship. Then we proceed to burst the cover of spies infiltrating the rebellion, but not without several severe misunderstandings both with the rebels and among ourselves. Yama's true motives and status are <i>almost</i> explained at last: he was sent on a secret mission by somebody close to the Empress, against the interests of other members of the court and the military - the mission being to save the Empire from itself. He has decided that thwarting the navy and helping out rebels is the way to go. Also, it turns out the Fine Line is equipped with a secret cyber-weapon not even Hari knew about - not without some effort, we manage <i>not</i> to use it. Rainbow reveals he was five years in a coma, thought hopeless, then miraculously came back - that's why he doesn't trust our judgment whenever imperial cyber-brain-implants &amp;the like are involved. Perhaps inspired by this new insight, Hari manages to revive a flatlined patient. Relationships between Rainbow and Hari keep developing around Tara, the ship's Anima. Yama promises to be upfront with Rainbow and Hari from now on, but still seems to have a generally hard time speaking the truth plainly.<br/><br/>Playing this sort of game by <i>Ribbon Drive</i> rules is more challenging than I had expected. There seems to be a learning curve to it, especially WRT how to frame and what to skip. Campaign-play rules in <i>Radion Accelerator Drive</i> are nice and interesting, no problem there. The challenge is playing an action-adventure (plus mystery) oriented <i>Ribbon Drive</i> game and <i>still make it work as a Ribbon Drive game</i>: to have meaningful idle conversations, bits of everyday life, and not worry too much about details that are irrelevant to characters' futures anyway.                        </div>

                            We played our last game of Carebears in class. It went well. A friend of them wanted to go to a concert but had broken both of her legs and the tires of her wheelchair were flat. How would they get her to the concert of her favorite group? (linked after the game to the four friends bringing their lame friend to Jesus by breaking open the roof of an overstuffed house)<br/><br/>They could choose who their friend was going to be, and we almost had a reappearance of Doctor Apple from the first game of this year. But they decided on creating a new npc named Annabelle. There was haggling for using of talents (which means more dice) which I was so charmed with that I allowed it. The difficulty went up though as the brave carebear wanted the garage to be scary to go into because of rats. They made it though, and collected a bicycle tire pump to blow up the tires and rushed them over to the venue of the concert. Now they had to find a way to get their wheelchair bound friend into there through the throngs of people. They had such a great success locating a staffmember and gaining access that they impressed the people organizing it with the lengths their friendship would go, so they all received a V.I.P. pass and could get authographs of the band.                        </div>

Ah, no. It's quite simple. It's a two D66-list with interesting words I made up and the players okay-ed. At the start of each session they roll three times to get three words and then I try to get them into the game. I offered it up as an alternative for the love-letters they'd started to expect from season two, since I have less time to devote to the game between sessions. It's also to force me to play to find out, something I have a bad GM habit of forgetting.                        </div>

I probably posted about it on here several years ago, I'm not sure. But <a href="http://nickwedig.libraryofhighmoon.com/2013/10/nameless-horror-version-0-2/" rel="nofollow">you can read the game over here</a>. The oracle deck in particular is really effective and cool in play, generating nightmare imagery on the fly, and sometime seeming like the deck of cards is perfectly tuned to the situation in the game. But I'm biased in the game's favor, so you can't take my word for it.                        </div>

                            Dungeon World continues. This time the oracle was eerily spot on without any contortions required: Killing, Unwelcome, Body Fluids.<br/><br/><b>S03E04 - Sweet revenge</b><br/>Agata the urchin wizard leads the way to her former prison, the orphanage, aiming to "traumatize" the wardens, an eye for an eye and all that. They run into her betrayed old friend Robert and a lot of maltreated children outside. Raoul the paladin performs a miracle of Ashtoreth and takes on Roberts blindness. Then they execute rightful revenge on Henriette and Guy, the two boar-people who have run the orphanage and plagued the children for so many years, having forced them to hunt the haunted city for valuables. In a violent battle that pushes Raoul to the utmost, he finds that it's not easy to fight blind, and some of the children are hurt. Robert gets an arrow in the heart and dies but Agata saves him with her magic potion. The next day they burn down the house and head off towards Mômeaux with all the children in tow. Arriving there, they surrender all the freed children into the not so happy care of Q, Raouls step mother, and wonder what to do next. But they are interrupted by the mole people gang and their companions who force them out of the village. The aim is to give the heroes a good walloping for having made fools out of them back in the haunted city. But the plan falls to pieces as the heroes slaughter a number of them. It ends with Yyr the death cleric setting their souls free and Gileon burning their bodies.                        </div>

                            We wrapped part 2 of Our Ladies of Sorrow, which was set in July 1967. Folks have hit the point where knowing someone's basically a walking talking skeleton just isn't sufficient reason to have a problem with the guy.<br/><br/>Jeremiah's player: That walking talking skeleton is going to help him get his son back. Jeremiah's far worse, so let's not be dicks about that.<br/><br/>(True -- Jeremiah knows he will turn into a shambling horror with a taste for human flesh when he dies.)<br/><br/>Folks got to a sinister city that was kind of made up of many bits of different cities / towns / settlements / et cetera.<br/><br/>Joyce: Why are we standing in front of this faux ugly New England house?<br/><br/>Martin: This is my old childhood home.<br/><br/>Joyce: This explains so much.<br/><br/>There was a taboo they all knew about, and I'd made sure to have an NPC who could break it if things stalled (that is, if everyone's active and top of their form, I don't necessarily have any business pulling that, but if everything's stalled because no one knows in or out of character what they want to do, having someone who can break things is useful), and... one of the PCs, knowing exactly what he was doing and why it was a really, really bad idea, deliberately broke that taboo. (The NPC was still useful to have around for reasons, one of which was one of the players indicated she wanted that to be a thing when I was recalibrating between sessions.)<br/><br/>So, shit hits the fan. I have given this particular PC a couple of spells for this eventuality because:<br/><br/>1. The supernatural menace can only be damaged by magic.<br/>2. There are two PCs who can do any magic, and one of them decided he's just not going to learn "icky" magic, i.e., magic that can be used offensively.<br/><br/>The spells I've handed the player of the other PC are:<br/><br/>1. Make darkness. He'd been dating a being whose name translated to "Mother of Darkness", so it made sense he'd have that.<br/><br/>2. Red Sign, an offensive spell that damages pretty much everyone in visual range of it.<br/><br/>3. Your hand is now the equivalent of a dagger -- basically, you've got an invisible knife for as long as you want to pay for it, and it can cut this creature. Of course, that puts you in very close proximity to it...<br/><br/>So...<br/><br/>1. I actually told him about this last session, and he figured his character still didn't remember knowing those spells. But, as I expected, he figured that when the shit hit the fan, he'd remember.<br/><br/>2. That invisible magical knife spell? Would work a lot better if he'd ever chosen to give his character the Weapon skill, which, in Trail of Cthulhu, covers stuff that is not Firearms, which he had, or clearly Scuffling. Oh, he also didn't give his character the Scuffling skill. (He did give his character Firearms for reasons which made sense.) He could still use the spell, sure, but he'd be limited to a result of 1D6 for the attempt to hit, and this wasn't a thing he could hand to someone else. (Yes, I knew this -- not when I first decided to give him the spell, but I knew it was a possibility and checked against the character's skills. He could have chosen to shift points around, but I also knew that was never the way to bet.)<br/><br/>3. Okay, so, he has a spell that just makes it dark and is highly unlikely to affect the creature, who can probably see in the dark, and a spell that will actually do physical damage to the creature. Naturally, he went with the spell that made it dark.<br/><br/>4. Oddly, this wasn't useless, as it meant that most of the group (4 PCs, 2 NPCs) did not see the creature and did not lose further Stability. Most.<br/><br/>He told everyone to orient themselves, threw the spell, centered the darkness on himself, and told everyone to run, figuring he'd run after them (following the sounds). He didn't tell them that last bit leading to this:<br/><br/>Joyce: Follow that eldritch blob of darkness!<br/><br/>Jeremiah: I think that blob of darkness is following us.<br/><br/>After a bit of running, the other PC who could do magic -- just not "icky" stuff -- decided to make a hyperspace portal to a place of safety, which I'd factored in and was counting on. This didn't mean anyone was anywhere near out of the woods -- er, desert -- yet.<br/><br/>GM: So, you're going to leave an open hyperdimensional portal?<br/><br/>Martin: Fuck!<br/><br/>Joyce's Player: This is what I have preparedness for.<br/><br/>Specifically, to have some sticks of dynamite and a fuse.<br/><br/>So, portal was created, and everyone but Jeremiah jumped through, Isidore dropped the darkness, and cast the Red Sign, which meant:<br/><br/>1. He and Jeremiah saw the creature, which means I managed to bump someone's Stability below 0, which means I'm doing my job.<br/><br/>2. Both men took damage from the sign. Jeremiah's player was disappointed that I rolled a 1 for that, but so it goes. If I get things right in the third scenario, I may be able to rectify that.<br/><br/>3. Both men got through the gate (and into Golden Gate Park).<br/><br/>4. The creature got a clawed hand through the gate.<br/><br/>5. The dynamite blew up, destroying the gate.<br/><br/>6. I had to figure out what that meant for the hand.<br/><br/>Me: Well... it can't be hurt by anything but magic, but that gate is magic...<br/><br/>So, one severed clawed hand hit the ground and was probably sent to Miskatonic University.<br/><br/>And we wrapped up the various loose ends, and I asked about towns near enough where folks are living in 1968 where there's both a sizable Hispanic population and a nearby river that might, oh, flood in period of severe protracted rain. The consensus was<br/><br/>1. I should switch the timing for the 3rd scenario to January 1969, not to 1968<br/>2. I should set it in Lompoc, CA.<br/><br/>That should work. I still need to turn the scenario's hook into something better.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>

                            Playtested a convention oneshot in the lead up to PAX Australia for my game Thornwood School of Magics on the weekend. It went really well! I think it should fit nicely into the timeslots I have also.<br/><br/>One great thing was when people were giving feedback at the end they were saying how certain mechanics felt and essentially repeating back to me my exact rationale for those mechanics. Which I was quite pleased with.<br/><br/>Also the guy whose house we did it at went all out, got magical school themed lollies and wizards hats and beverages. It was very fun to see how much everyone got into it, hopefully I'll see similar results with the complete strangers I'm going to play it with this weekend.                        </div>

                            The Dungeon World campaign continues at double pace due to some of the players expecting any time now. Unfortunately this time I dropped the ball due to inspiration at  low tide thanks to IRL issues. The oracle gave us "Blood, Stars, Poison" which sounds like a superb mix. However I totally forgot about the oracle. However, afterwards the players agreed that with them always gravitating towards murder-vagranting, Blood was a given.<br/><br/>The players have told me that they want to go out questing. The relationship map that we made to tie the characters to Mômeaux means nothing, they want to do some old school dungeon delving. Instead of just plopping them down in a cave and leaving the reason to flashbacks I was so stuck in what we had done so instead I tried to entice them with a mission that would give them leads as where to go (three of the characters want to find a plane walker for totally different reasons). I curse myself in hindsight because a lot of the session was spent on in character arguing of what they should do. Which is all well and good if they do it for a reason. Considering none of the characters have overlapping drives it was more like "we should split up, but where an adventuring gang so we stick together for really weak reasons". Boooooring as the president would say. But I did get the players to describe Laphroine where we'd never been before, so there's that.<br/><br/><b>S03E05 - Hold my hand</b><br/><br/>Burning the bodies they are approached by Guillaume Le Gros. He tells them that they need to lay low, having killed peoples spouses and siblings, and offers them a way out. If they can go north to the city of Laphroine and collect a person he wants to talk to he'll pay them money and send out word among his associates for whatever information they are looking for. They squabble for ever but finally agree. The journey north is uneventful except for Agata mistakenly tearing the fabric of reality and making their wagon float away in the heavens.<br/><br/>Laphroine turns out to be a walled city on the western side of the wide river Larhonne. Spanning the river is an enormous magical forested bridge and around the eastern bridge head is a large slum made up of refugees from Sorçel and the southern provinces. A large part of the slum dwellers are the unfortunate sentient zombies, creating a weird society where undead to the most demeaning and menial tasks. Looking for Joceline, a big red bear person with a gambling habit, the heroes enter the Bear Quarter. It's one of the poorer parts of the slums, hidden under the bridge. Unfortunately they get ambushed by muggers and the Branded's fire goes out of control. The paladin manages to order up a bucket brigade to stop it from spreading but the quarter is lost.<br/><br/>The heroes lay low in the zombie quarter as guests with the zombie elf Von Wiik. In return they will help him get his vengeance on his business partner who killed him. Side questing galore they try to sneak to the bridge the next day but get spotted by angry bears just before reaching the gates. However Agata manages to charm the guard captain with her newfound powers and they get to go up on the bridge.                        </div>

                            I managed to run approximately a third of cabal/character creation for <i>Unknown Armies</i>, 3rd edition, with an all-trans/genderqueer gaming group (which was hella cute!)<br/><br/>I was blown away by my player's creativity and quick vibing ~ I'd had two NPC ideas (a mechanomancer activist who has created a Courage Generator he's installed in a neighborhood to encourage them to fight back against the current government, and a Fool vestimancer who's obsessed with the power of intentional artificiality and gaining power by depowering herself), and my players basically handed them to me on a platter.  I might have to take out the first, tho, as it might actually violate one of the boundaries the group set ~ I think it was a hard no on anything to do with the Resident Rump; I've gotta check my notes and maybe run it by my players.<br/><br/>Speaking of the boundaries discussion, woohoo for being in my mid-30s!  Everyone reacted really well to the idea of "This is a horror game, and I don't wanna break my friends, so let's negotiate some."  It prolly helps that most are kinky, and so are very used to negotiating boundaries and things.<br/><br/>We've got a party consisting of a Newage (rhymes with "sewage"!) yoga instructor who was kidnapped by the Fool vestimancer's cult and accidentally squashed someone's ascension, a crusty gutter-punk dipsomancer named Gremlin (obsessed with "Getting fucked up and then fucking things up") who slept through her arm getting run over by a train and woke up to someone saying "You ruined my life!" who then vanished and became a ghost-arm possessing a mechanomancer-built cyberarm, a piece of living graffiti, an indy porn producer with maybe-magic jizz, and a techy who discovered that Google's stock prices were linked to the position of two Google scooters in a drainage ditch ~ one of which was ridden home by the yoga instructor after escaping the cult.  Said yoga instructor's obsession is masks, so I'm gonna hafta introduce the player to things like avatars, personamancy, and iconomancy.<br/><br/>Gremlin and the yoga instructor chose each other as protege and mentor, respectively, without even discussing it, so we've defdef got a rad pairing.  Sadly, the techy's player was a bit quiet ~ prolly cuz she only knew me out of the whole group and everyone else pretty much knew each other ~ so I gotta make sure she's engaged and involved and not pushed aside by social dynamix.

Aww... no problem! It’s an invisible problem until you’re suddenly confronted with it. My grandmother was wheelchair bound after a stroke. She used a cane around the house but needed a wheelchair outside. Only when riding around with her I noticed how inaccesible my city was, even though we’re supposed to be a western first-world country. Anyway. Thank you for the encouragement, and your delight in it makes happy as well. <img alt=":blush:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/blush.png" title=":blush:"/> As to the kids ages, they are seven, going on eight.<br/><br/>In other news, more classroom rp-ing summaries coming soon as I’m gonna still do some tomorrow probably! This week I’ve already run a Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple game wth a custom made letter and two games of Happy Birthday Robot. At least one more of those are coming up tomorrow! But I wanted to reply to the compliment before I’d forget, being the undiagnosed ADD adult I probably am.<br/> </div>

                            Fearless team leader of our larp writing group showed us an example of thinking outside the box on wheelchairs in one case. We'd found out that a player was wheelchair bound as this was under "what else should we know?" and tried to figure out how to make this part of the game.<br/><br/>Me: We cast the player as... oh. The one character who wouldn't use a wheelchair because that character can insta-heal. [Well, it technically takes a few minutes, but the larp unit of "five minutes" is highly flexible.]<br/><br/>FTL: No, Lisa, this character would absolutely use a wheelchair. Remember, this is someone used to lower gravity. So, the character clearly has a very high tech wheelchair, but that will be represented in game by whatever wheelchair the player has.<br/><br/>One quick inserted paragraph, and the player was emailing us delighted at having a character who, in character, had a wheelchair.<br/><br/>This is, of course, a variant of the first lesson I was ever taught about larping: Pay attention. If you pay attention, you can find an in-character justification for what you want to do.<br/> </div>

Um, do? Not much. I mean... I ran it more or less as written, with changes to reflect:<br/><br/>* I'm using Trail, not Call.<br/>* I don't like rolls I find pointless, so I cut them. Like, there's one sequence I wrote into my notebook for the campaign where I have "Stability X roll -- this is the only relevant roll for this entire section". (Okay, I was using Aviatrix's Fixed Stability Loss chart, but same basic idea.)<br/>* My flow chart. I made a flow chart. (small voice: actually i made several...) When the possibilities collapsed into one because the PCs decided how to do the desert, I made a different one.<br/><br/>This meant:<br/><br/>* We did the first bit as per the book -- peyote tea, a maze, a cleft -- and I cut some Jungian stuff that I just didn't think would be relevant to the PC.<br/>* I then forgot I was going to put in two specific bits around there, and jumped to the rock formation, remembering I was not going to draw this out for the players because that would be hellaboring.<br/>* The rocks bit went beautifully because I didn't even have to say "So, you're nowhere near where that rock formation should be" because Aviatrix's character, Joyce, said it for me. Also, because of how I was working Stability, I said to the psychonaut's player, "So, you can hold it together and lose this small bit of Stability, or lose it completely along these lines and lose this larger bit of Stability." Player chose the latter.<br/>* As night more or less fell, folks made the decision to camp in place.<br/>* At this point, I did my modification for the fact that we were doing this set in 1967, not 2009. No GPS to give crazy readings, and a spinning compass just isn't as ominous. But, Aviatrix's player said, "So, Joyce has Astronomy, and I'm looking at the stars..." And I said they changed every time she looked away and looked back, which was the equivalent of the GPS thing in all the ways that mattered.<br/>* Their guide had a conversation I'd figured he'd have if folks were decent to him because of ways the previous session had gone and because of other changes I made, and then I was thinking, "Okay, screw the extra scene at a mysterious fire where cryptic figure is cryptic, but doesn't actually give anyone new information. The two bits I forgot go HERE."<br/>* One of those was a desert sandstorm, which led to the other bit, and coming out of the other bit, we had the second maze.<br/><br/>And there, things went in a way I hadn't anticipated. So, I'd figured our psychonaut, Martin, would do the things that would mean when he reached the center, he'd vanish, and I'd set up a move-the-plot-along thing so folks wouldn't waste time trying to find him in ways that wouldn't work. I mean, yes, things would get dramatic, but we wouldn't be playing out the boring stuff. Oh, also, no one had to make pointless rolls to find the center of the maze. It's de facto a Core Clue in Trail.<br/><br/>So, Martin starts walking into the maze, and his lover is holding on to him, and I'm nodding, figuring, right, Martin will still vanish when they reach the center.<br/><br/>And then, Isidore, our psychiatrist, who has his own issues, decided that it was silly to walk the path through what was a maze with very low walls, like barely ankle high, and he started just walking over the walls on a straight path to the center.<br/><br/>And I called for an Athletics roll, with no points spent. Isidore, I should note, has 0 points in Athletics, for Reasons. The player rolled a 5.<br/><br/>Martin's player figured Martin wouldn't be trying to outrace anyone, just sort of walking in a trance, so didn't make a spend and rolled a 4.<br/><br/>And because of this, Isidore reached the center first, and no one vanished, and their destination appeared on the horizon. This was a very good thing for folks' mental equilibrium.<br/><br/>And at that point, the desert really wasn't a factor. I mean, walk to destination, events unfold, gate the fuck out of there.<br/><br/>I'm currently looking at the third scenario and realizing I'm likely to do an odd rewrite on things and that the result will give folks a goal beyond "go to this place for an ill defined reason (though one your Drives might be able to justify) and poke around trying to figure out why you're there". (Don't get me wrong -- this is a campaign that was reaching beyond what most CoC games ever attempted, and I don't think I could write something that good from scratch, but I am extremely aware of where the probable crash points are.)<br/><br/>Er, did that answer the question?                        </div>

                            Alright! I did the write-up of all games I played this week. All of them with primary school kids, which in Belgium is ages 7-12. The links on the games link to complete write-ups I did on Reddit.<br/><br/>We played <a href="denied:“https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/9rk5un/the_pilgrims_of_the_flying_temple_help_the/”" rel="nofollow">Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple</a> with my two 10-11 year olds, which took us two classroom hours to just not making it to the end (we could’ve if we would have gone for a pitchfork ending, but we wanted to win!). I was normally gonna do my homebrew city management thingy which I’ve fused with lasers and feelings (Servant and King) mechanics but is far from done yet. Again, I am way to ambitious for my own good. It was my first time playing it as well as theirs. I had fun. They got the joke of me changing the names by just putting a P before them and ran with it, applying it to other names as well!<br/><br/>EDIT: The html doesn't want to coöperate with me, so I'll just ugly-post the link here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/9rk5un/the_pilgrims_of_the_flying_temple_help_the/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/9rk5un/the_pilgrims_of_the_flying_temple_help_the/</a><br/><br/>Then we played a bunch of <a href="denied:“https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/9rlwv9/happy_birthday_robot_2_days_2_schools_5_groups/”" rel="nofollow">Happy Birthday Robot</a>, which was a lot of fun too. We finished a game with epilogue one time or twice, but in the cases we didn’t the stories turned out nice enough too. I’m curious wether or not I could change the first sentence to suit lessons and still keep if fun and not loose the narrative freedom you have when just using a robot birhtday party. Things like “Well done, Abraham” or “Choose the Right Thing, King Solomon!” Stuff like that. It might work. I guess I’ll just have to try it!<br/><br/>EDIT: The html doesn't want to coöperate with me, so I'll just ugly-post the link here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/9rlwv9/happy_birthday_robot_2_days_2_schools_5_groups/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/9rlwv9/happy_birthday_robot_2_days_2_schools_5_groups/</a> </div>

Yup.  I came up with this after our somewhat meh (not Mike Young's fault) experience in the Miskatonic Class Reunion larp, where we were cast as a pair of hapless greedy no-nothings who were trying to rig up an oil dig off the coast of Insmouth (yeah, we knew we were pretty much doomed going in).  There were a few mistakes we made, even with that setup.<br/><br/>First, Lisa's character had someone who she had a dislike relationship with, who she wanted to avoid. She avoided him.<br/><br/>Second, I was killed (I don't remember how Lisa's character was killed) when I was asked to go outside by another character--who was clearly suspicious to me out of character, but I didn't know a reason to be suspicious in character, so I went outside and got ambushed.  Death was on the table, but I would have rathered a more interesting death.<br/><br/>But in both cases, after the fact I realized that attention was at fault.  If one reads behind the lines, "You are avoiding Y because there's something interesting going on between you" reads as instructions to the player "avoid Y", but really it's not.  The character wants to avoid Y; the player wants interesting things to happen so they don't want to avoid Y.  So play your character, but make sure they bump into Y; just because you're paying attenton to where you're going doesn't mean your character is.<br/><br/>And as for my character getting ambushed, I lost track, in a complicated game, that this game had badge colors for what you looked like.  There was a normal color badge (white, probably) for someone who looked human.  And there was a grey badge for someone who looked not quite human.  And there was a dark brown (or something) badge for someone who looked completely inhuman.  There were even san loss secondary badges where you'd lose some sanity for looking at someone wearing them (or maybe this was coded into the badge color system; I don't remember any more).  THe person who lead me into an ambush was wearing a grey badge -- so I had every justification to see the badge/their inhuman face, get creeped out, and refuse to go anywhere near them, but because I'd disconnected from that level of the mechanics (and was also thus accidentally immune to san loss), it never even occured to me.<br/><br/>The core point, though, is that you should pay attention to three levels:  The narrative level; what's happening in the story.  This is the most important level, but also in some ways the squishiest, as at any given part of play the nature of the narrative is often a matter of debate.  Then there's the mechanical level; what the mechanics allow, what items you have in your Bag of Holding, whether someone's holding a prop of a Weapon of Hittings, etc.  And finally there's the personal level -- what do you want, what will make you enjoy or believe this game; where is the fun, how are other players around you doing and are they having a good time, etc.  A key to good play is paying attention to all three of these levels simultaneously, and then structuring your play to accomodate all three levels, rather than getting trapped in one or two levels and thus losing track of the rules, the narrative, or the people (including yourself).<br/> </div>

The key thing is that there's this place people regularly get lost and die in BEFORE you add any supernatural elements.<br/><br/>After that, it's a matter of landmarks, both physical and spiritual. It doesn't matter if one particular one is made of stone or wood. You want the cave. The sandstorm is useful, but honestly optional. You want something like the mazes. You want ways for the PCs to find the place where the adventure is.<br/><br/>Trail of Cthulhu is really useful here because it trains you to look at the building blocks of the adventure. What is the skeleton, the part you really need? What can you lose? What could you lose that you want to keep, and why do you want to keep it? And what do you tailor for your group?<br/><br/>I'm not sure if I'd have figured a lot of this out if I'd been keeping in in Call of Cthulhu. And I really needed to figure it out because the third scenario will need a whole lot of tweaking for me to be able to run it well.                        </div>

                            Unexpectadly played some more <b>Do:Pilgrims of the Flying Temple</b> with friends last night.<br/>This time not in class, just all adults, doing the intro letter “Swallowed Whole”. Despite being all adults, we did end up with poop humor though *facepalm*. It was the first rpg they ever played and they liked it. We might do another letter sometime soon! Also, this time we managed to get to the epilogue. We had a parades endingand all recorded how our Pilgrims changed through it. <br/><br/>I like how this is a parralel with Erikson’s core conflicts in the human devellopment. But that’s just my studies creeping in again.<br/><br/>Anyway, the whale that swallowed Melanie’s planet ended up having a tribe of pilgrim eating natives living on it’s back which we needed to get around to get to Melanie, which was a pretty cool devellopment! But in the end we got there. It was fun.                        </div>

                            On Thursday, we played a game of <b><i>Dread</i></b>. My friend has a tradition where every Halloween, he runs a Dread game set in the same campaign setting as his D&amp;D games. In this case, we used background characters from the campaign as PCs - street urchins and orphans hunting a folktale. This session showed off both what is good and what is bad about Dread, being an atmospheric, spooky tale with genuine tension, but also being railroady and overly focused on the GM as dancing monkey.<br/><br/>Then on Friday, we played a different horror game (a nameless game I wrote a few years back) and had a very different time dealing with pirate ghosts and cursed treasure. In the end, Blackbeard's ghost permanently possessed one of the PCs, a bootlegger in 1920s New Jersey. We all agreed that we wanted a TV show or novel or something telling the story about how a reincarnated pirate became the head of an occult tinged mafia group, using ruthlessness and black magic to take out rivals in the criminal underworld.  Maybe some day, that can be fodder for a different game.                        </div>

                            4th session of our <b>homebrew death cult PbtA</b> campaign.<br/><br/>We are using something similar to <b>The Veil's </b> (emotional) states instead of trad stats and this was the first time when <b>alleviating</b> really made the story more dramatic and tense. Maybe it is because we needed time to wrap our heads around the concept, or because this was the first time when most of the session played out in one long scene (a brutal undead siege). Finally we are on tracks!<br/><br/>Players gave the feedback that they never had deeper insight into their PC's consiousness than this campaign, so the combination of The Veil states + City of Mist themes really seem to shine here.<br/><br/>Also the campaign is getting more and more epic by every session, which was a sidequest for myself.<br/><br/>I'm more than satisfied.                        </div>

                            This summer one of the biggest Hungarian RPG community organized a 5-day-long adventure for our most well known RPG (M.A.G.U.S. is our AD&amp;D). I took the module and started to run it online as a <b>Blades in the Dark</b> hack.<br/><br/>The adventure is a pocket open world sandbox type thing where the agent PCs need to influence the outcome of the succession of a city-state. Intrigues, alliances, conspiracies and assassinations etc.<br/><br/>The rules are a lite version of BitD so it is actually a Forged in the Dark thing I guess. There are only 4 stats (Cape for athletics &amp; stealth, Mask for social skills &amp; perception, Blade for murder and fighting, Key for locks, traps and solving) and playbooks are more setting neutral than the original ones but that's all. There is no space for the faction game in the adventure though, my bad!                         </div>

                            Metatopia!<br/><br/><b>Battleborough</b> - Fiasco for Wes Anderson films, with an emphasis on webs of contentious relationships.  You can have a scene with the person next to you... or with the central NPC (e.g. Royal Tennenbaum).  A few other NPCs will be tracked as well.  Clearing dice off cards was a nice visual to track our progress from beginning to end (not sure if that was the designer's innovation, or something from Fiasco In A Box, which he said inspired him).  I was the conservative FBI agent older brother, wrangling with my smart liberal younger half-sisters.  What could have been a murder mystery (did the patriarch kill his first wife?) appropriately turned into the PCs primarily justifying their life choices to each other.<br/><br/><b>The Chosen One</b> - A contest between people or factions vying to come out on top, with enemy/ally rules that allow you to score points for certain other players' successes.  I small amount of strategy fed into die rolls to see who would prevail in each challenge, with various bonuses being unlocked along the way.  Highly original system!  Our group took the open-ended fictional premise and decided to contend for the title of "preeminent civilization".  Mine was a party bus of space hippie ravers with infectious positive vibes.  The others were some enlightened monk types and a hive mind.  It was very goofy and fun.<br/><br/><b>Descent Into Midnight</b> - Alien underwater PbtA adventure with community and corruption at stake.  We didn't actually play, we just discussed how to keep some element of violence in the game while making it an unappealing last resort.  This game is very ambitious, juggling multiple themes, and I'm looking forward to seeing where it eventually settles.  Lots of creative talent is already on display with the current draft and <a href="https://descentintomidnight.com/" rel="nofollow">website</a>.<br/><br/><b>Galactic Empires</b> - Politicking by the factions of Dune, using the rules of Undying!  Merchants, Navigators, the emperor, a noble house, all ostensibly aligned against an outside threat, but jockeying for leverage and position in the process.  One player took that to the max, sold out to help the outsiders, and left many of the rest of us in the dust.  I loved the color and the strategic PvP.  Some make-or-break balance/incentive issues had yet to be resolved, but I hope it gets there.<br/><br/><b>Flawless</b> - High concept adventure game where powerful spirits of order and chaos inhabit mortal bodies to contest each other on missions of interdimensional significance.  Broadly defined powers/abilities left great opportunities for creative action, and the resource and character change mechanics were well-calibrated and engaging.  The designer had some trouble explaining the concepts and rules and GM arbitration logic, but once we all got it, it was very cool.  It was very exciting to be there for the designer's first step outside of his home group!<br/><br/><b>Demihumans</b> - It's a human world with an orc/troll/fairy/etc. ghetto.  Inspired adventure fantasy meets chilling exploration of power dynamics.  Among the best PbtA playbooks I have ever seen, with every option, question, and custom move crafted to inspire player creativity and bring the characters to multidimensional life.  It was particularly fun to have the Human in our party, trying their best to be a good ally but with a nice dash of privileged cluelessness.                        </div>

                            Did an online playtest of Thornwood School of Magics with some people from the Gauntlet! Great session and some really thoughtful feedback from the players.  I'm feeling I might need to revise parts of my dice mechanic, or find a better way to explain it. It does so many things that I love but it might have too many moving parts. I'm in a good editing mood though so I'm ready to cut some things.                        </div>

                            2nd session of our BitD hack. This was my first session with FitD games where a mission didn't contain any violence, only (social) manipulation. It was very fun. Also, as I have witnessed it, you can totally run fun 60 minutes long missions in BitD.                        </div>

                            Season Two of my gaming lab wrapped up last weekend with an historic push for four games over one day: fleshed out a card based game I've been working on, <b>Roughhouse</b>.  Some great player feedback has pressed it into previously not considered realms.  <br/><br/>One of the GMs was able to run <b>Bluebeard's Bride</b>.  Though enjoyable suffered the same mechanisitic if/then play stuff that I don't enjoy about PBtA games.  Finally got to try <b>Montsegur 1244</b> after owning it for ten years and never  having the right crowd for it.  I feel that the next generation of games that took much from it have eclipsed it in networking (eg. Kat's new game) but still a joy to try a old warhorse.  Lastly, my first sampling of running an auto-hit osr game with <b>Into the Odd</b>.  It turns out I really don't miss the to-hit roll, which had always been a concern.  I'm still not convinced on just giving players traps, but willing to concede that I'm probably wrong about that too.  Time will tell.  I'm looking forward to the revamp of ItO as Electric Bastionland will likely claw back some of the osr advancements that have happened since its inception. <br/><br/>All in all, another lovely season of RPG Roulette.                        </div>

                            My group just completed an ongoing game of <b>Monsters and Other Childish Things</b>.  This is a game where you're a child, who has a weird pet monster who is sort-of a physical representation of your character's Id.  Mine was a turtle who had been crushed and glued back together, as my character had been through the Child Protective Services system.<br/><br/>Cool game and setting, and playing as children was an interesting challenge: the game makes you mechanically at the mercy of adults, and playing as characters who are just starting, flickeringly to become aware of sexual attraction was interesting to me; I often am attracted to romance stories, and this game moves those off the table, which forced me to go in different directions.  But of course, being a powerless child was very challenging for some players.<br/><br/>We also played each other's monsters, which worked pretty well.  A bit like how Wraith did it.  We created masks which we'd wear when playing monsters, which was silly and fun.<br/><br/>But I also feel like the game system didn't bring anything to the table.  What was cool in the game was our doing, or part of the setting, but wasn't really mechanically represented (or is like a storytelling principle, like that insults don't work on adults).  The game system was also startlingly opaque with its language at times; for example, if your monster attacks something, your "Gnarly" trait comes into play, which doesn't seem to have to do with anything.<br/><br/>I'd recommend the setting, but I'd bring something simpler in as a system, using some of the principles from the original as a basis.  I'd even be tempted to write custom PBTA playbooks for different styles of monsters and kids, but maybe that's too far.                        </div>

                            I adapted <b>Happy Birthday Robot!</b> for class to play <b>Congratulations with your baby, Sarah!</b> and it went very well on both occasions. After playing it the first time, when I had just replaced “Robot” with “Sarah” or “Baby” (pick one), I started seeing some more potential in accordance with lesson goals (Why children are valuable), and I replaced the storyteller’s free word “Robot” with one (any) descriptive word describing the positive value of the baby, to be freely chosen again each time you start a new sentence.<br/><br/>I’m looking for a specific game to play on monday about traveling through a desert but can’t find it, but might just adapt this again to play something along the lines of “Watch out in the desert Mozes!” and getting free uses of desert specific dangers or something.<br/><br/>Anyway, the kids loved it before fallbreak and now asked me “Can we play that robot game again?” which is pretty sweet!<br/><br/>Non school, non story-game related we played the boardgame <b>Isle of Skye</b>, which was very fun to do. But anytime I have time for boardgames during the week is a win.                        </div>

Tell us more about that game and we might be able to pinpoint it! (I thought "<i>Perseverant</i>" for a fraction of a moment, then realized that's way outside your classroom constraints.)<br/> </div>

                            It was not this week, it was the week before. It was the Utopiales, big french sci-fi con' with a big Games Area. 30 RPG tables at the same time on the friday evening (and multiple miniatures / boardgames tables at the same time).<br/><br/>I was GM / Facilitator all the time. I've played one <b>Swords Without Master</b> "vanilla" game. I've played a little hack of SWM that I called <b>Ghosts Without Master</b>. Dark Souls / Castlevania / Ravenloft / Seven to Eternity feeling to it, the two Tones being Calm &amp; Sinister instead of Glum &amp; Jovial. Also, scarce magic with a pool resource I designed for my bigger hack of SWM.<br/><br/>I played two games of "<b>Les Orphelins du RadX</b>" (The RadX Orphans), my Diesel-punk / Kids with super-powers / Mysteries &amp; Conspiracies hack of Swords Without Master. Players went to Saigon and Nantes in one very good game (Saigon) and one less good (Nantes). Playtesting it revealed good (and bad needing to be corrected, so also good) things.<br/><br/>And I played one <b>Monster of the Week</b> game with my mystery Grumpy Bear. A great game with enthusiast players. Last but not least, there was an open-table talk about "Playing without GM", and I've set up a <b>Protocol</b> game following it. Home was the playset. It was very intense, and two players were discovering the "without GM" RPG. They want more !<br/><br/>My blog <a href="http://www.gulix.fr/blog/tag/utopiales/" rel="nofollow">has more details</a>, in French.                        </div>

Tell us more about that game and we might be able to pinpoint it! (I thought "<i>Perseverant</i>" for a fraction of a moment, then realized that's way outside your classroom constraints.)<br/></div></blockquote>
At first I thought it was <b>A Thousand Years Under The Sun</b> by Matthijs Holter, but while slightly appropriate it's not what I was looking for. I remember reading the game I'm looking for on a blog multiple years ago and even then thinking it might be an RPG I might be able to play with church friends without having to weave around the superstition that by playing an RPG you let the devil into your life or something.<br/><br/>Anyway, it was short enough to fit on a blogpost I think, it was about an exodus (maybe even called such, but I'm not sure) and it's at least more than two years old, maybe even a lot older. Google hasn't been able to let me retrieve it.                        </div>

                            I was planning to playtest a game I was writing about the role of witches in D&amp;D. But I abandoned that idea at the last minute (the subtext of the monster was too misogynistic, despite my effort to change that).<br/><br/>So I came up with a completely different game in the afternoon, a hack of <b>Archipelago</b> about some people on an increasingly surreal road trip. As we journey westward, we also move into parallel universes, which are increasingly different from our home universe.<br/><br/>The playtest went pretty well. We only got through rules explanation and character creation and a few scenes. But my PC was shot by an angry bookie, and we bartered for dinosaur egg omelettes from a diner and the PCs recruited a talking dog to the party. I think we might play the game some more in future weeks.                        </div>

Please tell me more about this!!!<br/><br/>BTW we had our 3rd session of my Forged in the Dark campaign. Also, our 1st test of S.A.M.A.N. 2.0, an rpg project trying to evoke the subgenre of Hungarian fantasy literature nicknamed 'entrepreneur fantasy'. So I'm trying to run 3 different campaigns in the world of Ynev, which is the official world of M.A.G.U.S. (the Hungarian D&amp;D). All of them are in different genres/styles though. Ah, the pain <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            @ hamnabc: O.K., I´ll try to describe it (but it´s less spectacular than our ingame experience...):<br/><br/>In Ars Magica there are kinds of planes of all sizes parallel to the medieval reality for all supernatural powers (infernal planes, divine planes, magic planes and faerie planes). These planes are called regios and if you have no help from residents of these planes and you´re not a mage specialized on travelling from plane to plane it may be difficult to enter them.<br/><br/>Birthright is an Ars Magica Faerie Adventure. The Adventure is open shaped, but in our case, the characters moved onto a faerie plane and wanted to rescue a kidnapped noble damsel and her newborn child from there. Very soon after entering the faerie plane the characters had a fight with four faerie knights. They were able to rout them out, but one character died in this fight, so the players sat on the edge of their chairs. It seemed to be a dangerous an adventure.<br/><br/>The damsel was trapped in a dungeon in the faerie princess´ castle... but the castle itself was another plane and only three of the six characters were able to enter. They made friends with the cupbearer of the castle and found the girl with his help, but couldn´t free her, because the cupbearer was friendly but watchful, too. At last they visited the wine cellar, drank some dreamberry wine and found themselves before the castlegate the next morning.<br/><br/>The other three characters found out, that the child of the girl lived with "old nanny" in the "nursery"... the darkest part of the faerie forest. They found the place... but again... the "nursery" was another plane and only one of the characters - the mage - was able to enter. The "nursery" was a room of cramped trunks and high treetops. In the middle the child was resting on a big stump. The place was pitchblack, there only was a shaft of moonlight illuminating the resting place of the child. In the treetops there was a kind of movement, but the mage wasn´t able to identify its origin. The whole place was criss-crossed with very big cobwebs.<br/><br/>Our brave mage made some moves and got stuck at the cobwebs very soon. Then he used a spell that destroyed all animal products in a room. In this moment all cobwebs vanished into thin air - and after a short but heavy rustling in the trees above him an elephant-sized spider dropped on the floor next to the mage - "old nanny"! The fight was short and merciless. Soon the mage was incapacitated, poisoned and cocooned.<br/><br/>Still there were two characters before the entrance to the nursery, and they didn´t know what was going on. Because they couldn´t enter the room and the mage didn´t come back, they made noise: shouting, beating wood on wood, etc. Some minutes later, an elephant-sized spider lept from the nursery. The players lost heart, the two poor fellows were shocked and perorated with their lives, but at least one of them was a good archer and did a last shot. They survived, because "old nanny" fatally botched a defense roll. It was one of these rolls, we will talk about for a long time. The arrow wholly bored into the giant body of the spider and killed it. The tremor of the agonising spider filled the forest.<br/><br/>Then it was quiet. But that wasn´t the end. There was still a dying mage in the "nursery" and the two fellows weren´t able to enter. The other fellow was a kind of troubadour, able to play some low magic music. He tried to pull some forest inhabitants to him by playing his lute - and suddenly a nearby rock got two feet - and then a head - and two arms at last. It was a stone troll. After some difficult conversation the troll was ready to retrieve the mage and the child from the "nursery" - if the both fellows were willing to kiss him on his chops. Allright, they did it and got mage and child.<br/><br/>The last difficulty was the treatment of the acherontic mage. They healed him, but it was very tight.<br/><br/>All in all there were four or five situations our hairs stood on end.                        </div>

To understand this sarcastic term you need to understand its context. When Hungary ceased to be a socialist country and the iron curtain collapsed the new ethos of the era became the self made man, the 'entrepreneur' who does these 'free market ' things, has a lot of connections (even with foreigners, lol), wears import clothes, etc.<br/><br/>Also, the society often connected this with the trend of imitating the 'digo' way (dico in Italian and I guess it's Dago in English). Digo is basically stereotypical and romanticized Italian/Mediterraen culture. Which was popular then.<br/><br/>This have lead to the M.A.G.U.S. fantasy series where the protagonist acted like a weird mix of James Bond and Indiana Jones. Mimicing Italian parfume promotion posters, always behaving very cockily and acting professionally (with a half smile!). Usually in a Venice like city state where some scheming have happened... With cyberpunk tropes but with a fantasy renaissance setting.<br/><br/>The term comes from the 2010s when we tried to identify and name the RPG ethos of the early nineties.<br/><br/> I hope this helped!                        </div>

                            GM'ing my way through "Shadows of Yog-Sothoth" for <b>Call of Cthulhu 7th.</b> My players keep deciding to call the police.  They get halfway through a scenario and then decide calling the police in and telling them the truth is the way to go. Hopefully they can still manage to save the world. If not, I may have to have them locked up.<br/><br/>My <b>DnD 5e</b> crew is working their way through the back half of "Out of the Abyss."  Twenty five-ish sessions in - maybe 12 or 14 more to go. Early on, they convinced me to go to milestone leveling, which I'm now regretting.  First time I've done it and I won't do it again. May have to find different players though.<br/><br/>Played in a game of <b>Fiasco</b> at our biweekly meetup and online played the second session (of three) of an expansion for <b>Good Society</b> called Sense, Sensibility and Swordsmanship (which I'm really digging).                        </div>

                            Our Ladies of Sorrow, Part 3, Call of Cthulhu 2009 campaign scenario set in Baleford (fictional city) Illinois turned into a Trail of Cthulhu 1969 campaign set in Solvang, California (with the same map, so very much a fictional city).<br/><br/>My research included looking up which Dark Shadows and Star Trek episodes were on tv in January and February. This involved<br/><br/>a. Explaining Dark Shadows to my husband (not a player, but who'd managed to miss out on Dark Shadows to his surprise, whereas I'm surprised I actually saw, well, any of it)<br/><br/>b. Half the group trying to keep me from going into too much detail on which Star Trek episodes were on in 1969 because they've not seen them<br/><br/>c. The other half trying to keep me from going into too much detail on which Star Trek episodes were on in 1969 because they _have_ seen them (there were some good 3rd season episodes of Original Trek, but also a lot of really bad ones)<br/><br/>d. Spending far too much time in character arguing over call signs because one player decided her PC watched Star Trek with his son and assigned walkie talkie call signs accordingly<br/><br/>We also had plot -- a missing NPC who was the lover of one PC and the adopted daughter of two others (who don't yet know about the lover business), interviewing people and doing research, one PC riding into town on her horse and handing her rifle and ammo to the hotel clerk before chewing out the other PCs, said other PCs being passive agressive at her while cleaning out a wound she got when La Llorona tried to pull her off her horse. I think it was a tie -- the PC got a bruised and bloody ankle while La Llorona got stabbed in the wrist.<br/><br/>But it's the call signs that I'm going to be dreaming of.<br/><br/> </div>

                            Got to do a dramatic entry as a new character in an ongoing (30+ session) Torchbearer campaign.  GM and I hashed out a concept and he remembered a Tiefling thug the party had captured many sessions ago and then kind of forgot about.  He caught me up on the campaign so far, and then we half-planned/ half improvised my introduction and ingratiation into the party.  It felt somewhat contrived by necessity (the party couldn't exactly turn me away) but working to make it as plausible as we could was a fun roleplay challenge.                        </div>

                            Ended up “hacking” Happy Birthay Robot to <b>“Watch Out In The Desert Moses!”</b> for the lessons. They liked it. I also really like how you can influence how a story goes by choosing which words to offer up for free for the neighbours. So, the storyteller could use <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one desert-danger</span> for free each turn, while the neighbour to the right could use <span style="text-decoration: underline;">because</span> for free and the neighbour to the left could use <span style="text-decoration: underline;">so</span> for free.<br/><br/>In the original game the words suggest the writers to have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">robot</span> doing or feeling or being something <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> have something else happen <span style="text-decoration: underline;">but</span> having something change in the story. The words for the neighbours also always give opportunity to easily make the sentence longer. In the Moses game I chose words that could do this as well but also be easily used to point out a danger (because) and add a solution (so). I like this game a lot. Probably gonna have to start switching things up though, to keep things varied and fresh.                        </div>

                            We continued our campaign of my surreal road trip hack of <i>Archipelago </i>on Friday. One player had never roleplayed any at all, so this was sort of a weird introduction to the hobby. <br/><br/>Over the course of play, she wound up also roleplaying her PC's evil universe alternate universe self. That would be a weird thing for even an experienced roleplayer. But she did a great job playing both characters, highlighting the small number of defined personality traits the characters had and driving the game toward interesting conflicts. <br/><br/>Very quickly, the evil universe self drugged half the PCs, and bullied the other PCs into helping her rob a bank. Since the universe we were in ran on a barter economy, she got a pair of shoes, some pens and a chicken, all of which she lost in the getaway chase.                        </div>

                            My death cult campaign had its 5th session.<br/><br/>PbtA games really start to shine around the 5th session! I feel like that the idea of fronts solved the motivating problems of trad sandboxes. I still have bangs and clocks etc but more and more emergent thing happens between established nodes in the setting. Players love to riff on these.<br/><br/>Also, I love that I can incorporate in setting what I learned and think about tanatology.<br/><br/>Im often anxious when I prep because Im usually just one or two steps ahead of the players and I fear that if they realize this (the no myth thing) than the game will collapse, but it actual play it had never occured.<br/><br/>I also think that I cannot live up to my own expectations about giving meaningful and extraordinary colour to this campaign but I successfully raised the stakes thru the last few sessions.<br/><br/>We tried to zoom out and glance thru a 6 weeks period but only got thru half of it in 4 hours. Not a real problem!                        </div>

                            I got lazy for a while and did not post. My gaming was sporadic the last couple of months, but I did get to participate in some very engaging games!<br/><br/><b>With Great Power</b> – We played as the Van Hous children who got their powers and were separated during their late childhood when an experiment by their parents went awry. The story we explored during our session revolved around addressing the havoc brought by the want-to be dictator Sergeant Snow. He happened to grow on the streets and be a friend of one of the heroes, but he wanted a world where people with powers ruled over those without them. As the superheroes were brought together by this havoc, they got to work together. As they worked together on this, the emotional issues that drove them apart were brought to the surface, the heroes tried to address them, but the havoc kept on interrupting these efforts.<br/><br/><b>Fall of Magic</b> – Since we usually play one-shots, we had never managed to finish Fall of Magic as it requires more than one sitting. Well, we played it a little looser and managed to tell a full story this time in a single session by consolidating locations and, on occasion, moving the Magus before everyone had had a scene. We passed up some opportunities to deepen individual stories or relationships, but there was no real cost to creating these mega-locations that moved the story along more quickly. I think it can work regularly to allow us to play this game more regularly.<br/><br/><b>Dream Askew</b> - Our queer enclave consisted of Rabbit, leader of a religious sect intent on preventing the hierarchies of the past from infesting the present; Chief Proust, a nostalgic owner of Vint Age, a coffee shop and apparel store; Spector, whose workshop tried to preserve whatever could be useful: bikes, fruits, vegetables, meds, fermented grains; and a new arrival, Audi, victimized but competent, a former nurse who’d lost it all.<br/>Rabbit and Chief Proust kept getting in each other’s way, leading to violence at Proust’s shindig to bring the enclave together, violence that burned out his shop. But the violence was abruptly ended when Rabbit saw a vision of a horde of warriors descending upon our enclave and destroying it. Working together, the enclave built a Potemkin settlement in an abandoned stadium and led the warriors, when they finally arrived, to destroy that false village rather than our real home.<br/><br/><b>Tall Pines</b> - When Jared fell to his death in the small mountain town of Tall Pines, it shook up his classmates most of all. Heather had kept his love for Philip Tudor secret by claiming to be his girlfriend, which had created envy in his best friend Todd, who wanted Heather for his own. Greta knew of his fear of dying alone, but by the time she dropped her cynical facade, it was too late to help him…<br/>This was my second time running Tall Pines and it was a great success. The image cards get to create some really cool surreal leitmotivs. Do note that the instructions that come in the box are incomplete. Download the ones from the website, those do work.<br/><br/><b>Follow</b> – We got a bit nostalgic about D&amp;D campaigns that never finished so we dusted off old characters and brought them together in a game of Follow. Our quest was to kill the Dragon terrorizing our land, which had originally been attracted to us by the wild dragon flowers conjured by one of the PCs and the mountain of gold compiled by another PC’s family.<br/><br/><b>Until We Sink</b> – We explored a mysterious, haunting island sinking into the Pacific. Just before we arrived, Dave the fisherman died on the rocks for no apparent reason. The night after our arrival, Velma the bush pilot sees a figure on the rocks in a storm, but no one else witnesses it. Luke an alcoholic writer hiding on the island is secretly trying to determine what happened to Dave, but Lily the owner of the hotel keeps trying to put him off the scent. But Luke and Lucy, a stoner backpacker whose washed up here, go up into the cave that Lily keeps warning them away from and discovers a pentagram and various occult paraphernalia… <br/><br/><b>Pasión de las Pasiones</b> – I had been wanting to run this for a while, and finally got a chance to take a crack at it! In episode 143 of this ongoing Telenovela, we got to explore the life surrounding an extravagant club in Miami. The club in question was known for its extravagant chocolate fountains and exotic animals petting zoo. It all started going downhill when Blanca, the clumsy employee forgot to lock up the tigers at the end of the shift. Her lover, Indigo, came to the club to help, but he was smitten by Marcela, the beauty of the club and got distracted with her. In the meantime, Valencia, the owner of the club was plotting with Blanca’s twin sister Bianca on how to expand the club’s burgeoning cocaine dealing business. While Valencia was trying to keep her club operating, and expanding her business, Indigo used his looks to seduce countless people at the club, much to the chagrin of Blanca who loved him. Trouble escalated when we learned that Marcela’s boyfriend, Federico, who happened to be Indigo’s son, started working at the club…while also being an undercover informant for the police.<br/>The game did what it was supposed to do. I was not very clear on how leverage and stress worked, especially in a one-shot, but we made it work. We even got some really cool flashbacks. To get the story started, I modified the questions from <b>The Ward</b>’s Night-Shift scenario. It gave us plenty of drama to get the story going.<br/><br/><b>Final Voyage of the Selene</b> - Chief Engineer Pryce and Artiste Bahk had served alongside each other on the Selene for decades, sharing a love of the rejuvenating illicit substance known colloquially as "snooze juice". When some new passengers came aboard at the latest stop, Bahk hoped they'd become fans of his band, the Agents of the Son. But they all had their own agendas. Disgraced Lieutenant Kazarian, of the military organization Agents of the Sun, hoped to find meaning in private security. Professor Carris was continuing her research into void technology, seeking the elusive Boomerang Effect. And Courier Lane Kerenski just wanted to safely transport some sensitive information, while meeting some new people and learning about humanity.<br/>I love this game. The secret agendas fed into each other wonderfully and we ended up with a great story with a very dramatic ending. (And we even got Elina to appear as an NPC, and yes, she did have a drink with her).<br/> </div>

I'll let the real Elina know; in fact, I might have to start a tab for her and buy her all these drinks she's owed at the next convention we both attend.<br/><br/>Glad you had fun with the game too :-D<br/> </div>

                            We had Protocol last night. It was the first time that it sucked for me. We were tired and Protocol usually generates a more fragmented, more 'stroboscopic' experience than e.g. Fiasco, but most of the times its not a problem for me. I like surreal art house gameplay, creating atmospheric montages and vignettes etc. But mixing this game with murder mystery (The Calendar Man playset) was a huge mistake IMHO, we were totally baffled at whats going on in the story. The unholy breed of Sherlock Holmes and NCIS on LSD. Maybe sounds fun but not really <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>

                            Josh and I are playing authors of a kickstarter stretch goal. We just finished making up a bunch of charts to role up an adventure, and I'm creating a sample campaign arc that takes place over a NYC school year. So, I looked up the school year calendar online and found some surprises (there are four parent-teacher conference days? I only remember two growing up, and... didn't they take place at night? And Josh doesn't remember any parent-teacher days once he reached high school) and some things I didn't recognize, but could figure out or google, and one of which still has me shaking my head in befuddlement even after I've looked it up (Anniversary Day, which was not one of the holidays from school when I was growing, and which is celebrated city wide to mark the anniversary of the first Sunday school in Brooklyn and Queens -- why that one? Did we need an extra holiday in June for some reason? I remember Clerical Days and Clerical Half Days).                        </div>

                            Playing some Castles and Crusades tomorrow night.  I've got a group that meets biweekly and we're on session 13.  Originally we played once every 4 weeks so the first 10 episodes to almost a year.  We were interspersing a board game night between our RPG night.  However we decided that was too slow for the RPG.  Now we play 4 - 6 months of C&amp;C every other week and then take a break to play board games for a few months. <br/><br/>I'm really liking C&amp;C.  It hits a real sweet spot for me and I can use all those cool 1st and 2nd Edition modules and accessories I've collected with almost no modification.                        </div>

                            Last week I played some How To Host A Dungeon 2 Playtest. It was fun. The surface of this created world is a blasted, rocky wasteland, and underneath there’s no ore or gems of any kind worth mining, but there is like an ancient godlike dragon hidden away, a magma river and several different biomes, of which the dwarven civilization have learned to make use. One group made an empire on the surface world and another group became underground slime farmers. Looking forward to see what will happen once I go to the age of monsters or run the crashed alien spaceship scenario.                        </div>

                            Actually played my C&amp;C game on Friday.  It was lots of fun.  Had 8 players show up which would be incredibly cumbersome in some versions of D&amp;D but which was only a little bit slower in C&amp;C.  I do admit that too many more players will be bumping up on my maximum number of reasonable players to handle at the table.  Anyway, the group ran off a small tribe of lizardfolk that had been harassing local fishermen.  Much mayhem and bloodshed was had.                        </div>

                            Played Call of Cthulhu for the first time.  The GM (though the system has another name for this I can't recall) was very upfront that this was a railroad run straight from a boxed campaign.  So we improvised some dialogue, played along with the plot, and saw where it took us.  My favorite detail was the steady stream of British street urchins that arrived to give us plot hooks.<br/><br/>It reminded me very much of a text adventure.  Sometimes you type an input and something unexpected happens.  Usually, you just say 'look at object' to hear more detail and 'open door' to see the next scene.  If you want to do something off the rails, it just ignores your input and asks for another one.<br/><br/><br/>Also, played a first-round playtest of Goblin Town, a game my group is working on for using Otherkind dice to run old D&amp;D modules.  It was light and fun.  As the GM, the improv lift of Otherkind resolution left me wiped after a couple of hours.                        </div>

                            Night´s Black Agents: Unto the fourth generation. Our heroes met Dracula at a gypsy camp. Abraham Van Helsing wanted to talk alone with the gypsies ("<i>they won´t do something to an old man like me</i>"). The other characters hid behind a nearby house and waited for him to come back. It took a while, but at last Van Helsing convinced the gypsies to marshal him to Dracula. Dracula and Van Helsing had a creepy meeting in a gypsy caravan (with windows barred by blinds). Van Helsing told Dracula that he is a german spy: "<i>Now you realize that the english are not very hospitable and therefore I want to offer you a similar bargain in a pleasant environment: a luxurious lifestyle in the empire for a service as secret weapon of the german army</i>".  Dracula smiled, accepted and stung himself in a finger. He dropped some blood in a glass of wine, handed it to Van Helsing and said: "<i>Let´s toast our new alliance!</i>" Van Helsing knew that the wine would infect him, but saw no other choice. He drank and got a part-time servant of the master. Then Van Helsing returned to Dr. Seward, Holmwood, Morris and Mina Harker. He explained to them, that the whole pursuit through romania was a fake: "<i>Dracula is not here! We fell for one red herring after the other. Probably Dracula has been entrenching himself for weeks in his castle - whereever it may be. I´ve had it! I´m returning to England or Germany and quit following some bogey.</i>" No one knew that Van Helsing is a spy. No one knew what happened in the gypsy caravan. So they believed him. With a little help from Mina Haker he convinced Dr. Sewart, Quincey Morris and Arthur Holmwood to quit the hunt, too. Holmwood wanted to blow the whole gypsy camp up anyway ("<i>just for safety</i>"), but his increasing paranoia made the others soaking his dynamite stocks while Holmwood took a leak. Now Holmwood quit his friendship with the others. Van Helsing and Mina Harker are servants of the vampire and Dr. Sewart and Quincey Morris have to start back for home - without Holmwoods nest egg.<br/><br/>Soon we´ll go on with other characters who prepare better.                        </div>

                            "Keeper" is our pretentious name for CoC GM -- it's short for "Keeper of Arcane Lore". (Not all CoC games are railroads, but best to be up front if yours is.

                            Just ran Our Ladies of Sorrow part 3, episode 2, and am coming down from a high. I am not entirely sure what happened this session because there were a LOT of heart to heart talks of varying levels of angst, intimacy, and belligerence among the PCs. (Like, I know the jist, but not the dialogue.) Lots of stuff hit the fan due to a combination of factors, so... apart from a bit of combat here and there, an ominous dream or two, a vision or three, and some basic investigation (yep, that thing you were expecting to find is indeed there), I had my hands off the wheel.<br/><br/>The big reveals weren't from the scenario, but from stuff the players had decided and that most of them knew, stuff the players had explicitly left in my hands but decided to open, and stuff the players didn't know existed but paid for so were by Tsathoggua going to get.<br/><br/>Stuff all the players knew going in: Isidore (PC) has been seeing and having sex with Vivian (NPC), who is the adopted daughter of Martin (PC) and Jeremiah (PC). We knew this would come out sooner or later, and it did, because there's been some minor bodyswapping between Vivian (who's gone missing, kidnapped by the big bad) and Isidore, and Martin realized that there's this bodyswapping spell, but that only works when you have a large degree of intimacy...<br/><br/>Martin: Isidore, have you been having sex with Vivian?<br/><br/>And, inevitably, eventually, when he was less furious, Jeremiah did ask what Isidore's intentions toward his daughter were.<br/><br/>Isidore finally went all out in an attempt to find out what his mind was blotting out, and after confirming that the player did want the cards on the table (as this is not, in fact, always the case with this player), I put what I had out, and... he had a suggestion which made it all So Much Worse, so I went with it.<br/><br/>And then, Joyce (PC) was trying to figure out an anomaly, and paid a point of Cthulhu Mythos / Unnatural to do so. The anomaly: Why is the big bad apparently gung ho on killing her, when that doesn't seem to fit the situation?<br/><br/>Answer: Well, there's clearly bleed of some kind between the big bad and the kidnapped Vivian, and Joyce was involved in events surrounding the murder of Vivian's mother. (Long story boiling down to in a previous campaign, Vivian's mother threatened another PC who took preemptive, fatal action -- and the only reason she never did more than threaten him was he killed her first.)<br/><br/>Player: So, I should cross off some Stability?<br/><br/>And at this point, it occurred to me that if the player is paying for it, I could connect some dots and probably should. Also at this point, there were a couple of conversations going on, so that I could mouth to the player "body switching" until she understood.<br/><br/>That is, we know Vivian body switched with Isidore.<br/>We know the body switching spell can be and generally is used by evil people.<br/>So... is Vivian really Vivian? Or is she her mother and always has been, her mother having jumped into her infant body at the moment of death?<br/><br/>See, that is worth the points the player was prepared to spend.<br/><br/>One of her pillars may have crumbled.<br/>One of Martin's crumbled as well.<br/>I need to phrase some questions to the players so I have a chance of getting best information to plan next session. I don't know if it'll be as intense, but... we're gonna try.                        </div>

                            This week, in class I used <b>story dice</b> to tell stories with my one pupil that’s not good at reading. It was hard to keep it Nativity themed, but meh, I learned and have some ideas to make it more guided, on which I might extrapolate later in a separate thread.<br/><br/>Then today we did a more simplified and nativity themed version of the King David is Dying game with my pupil from Protestant class and the six kids from Catholic class. I call it <b>The Shepherds and the Angels</b>, and these 10 year olds loved it, jumping over each other to be the Shepherd that is adressed by the Heavenly Host to go and visit the newborn Messiah in the manger. The shepherd had to explain why they didn’t feel worthy to do that (either due to having done bad things or just not feeling worthy because of circumstances) at which point the angels would tell them about either second chances or how everyone is welcome. Seeing hiw it was such a success, I might translate it a bit and post it on here as well, or link to a Google Drive file or something.                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> I've heard legends of Jeff Collyer's walking LARP version of Witch at Camp Nerdly, but I've always played it as a tabletop game; in fact, Witch was the game where I noticed a curious facet of these games on the boundary of LARP/story game--the narrative freedom I had to frame and describe a scene is something a bit trickier to make work as a LARP, I think; it led to a fascination with this subgenre (and you know, me writing one <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> )<br/><br/>OTOH when I played with a Scandinavian LARPwright she was more interested in doing Witch as a LARP so that you could feel the emotions in your body <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> so YMMV                        </div>
