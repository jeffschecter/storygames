If you take away only one thing<br/>from this play test report, it should be this: Business Solutions produces a<br/>surprisingly consistent mood, just a little comedic, without having the<br/>no-rails wackiness that's a common result of play without a GM.  That in and<br/>of itself was surprisingly cool.<br/><br/>Precis on the game: Three players make 6 repairmen, in pairs of junior and<br/>senior.  Six scenes, where one player presents a business, one player plays<br/>his senior, the other the junior, and they go out to fix a copy machine.  In<br/>the course of the scene, one of the repairmen will also run into someone they<br/>know, and play out some difficulty in that relationship.  There's a real<br/>commerce in mojo cards, that at the end of the game (the All Hands meeting)<br/>will result in one character being promoted, and his first job being to fire<br/>the one with the least good mojo.  Really fine single session role playing.<br/><br/>Characters: \n<ul>\n<li>Mark: Sylvester Leroi, lead patronizing old-timer in need of<br/>crime; Dylan Opal, trainee irritating hipster in need of slack<br/></li><li>Josh: Jessica Jones, lead unsavory geek in need of lunacy; Auggie<br/>Penderson, trainee bitter nerd in need of power.<br/></li><li>Judson: Bruce, lead clueless creep in need of betrayal; Aaron, trainee<br/>earnest noob in need of loyalty<br/></li></ul>\nThe clients were Diamond Jee's, a jewelry store in a bad neighborhood,<br/>Interstate Gravel, which was very dusty, and Bridgewater animal control and<br/>correctional facility.  <br/><br/>Sadly, the only relationship I have noted is Sylvester's grasping buddy, who I<br/>distinctly remember as being an old army money who wanted to borrow a little<br/>more money to cover gambling debts.  I do remember a consistant quality level<br/>about the various relationships, and it all worked well.<br/><br/>Specific quibbles we had over the course of play:\n<ul>\n<li>We'd considered the possibility of doing a switchback to select<br/>initial needs, so that everyone gets a fair pick from the list.<br/></li><li>There was the suggestion of there being some kind of random tables to<br/>suggest ideas for businesses<br/></li><li>There was a question about when exactly the relationship type is chosen.<br/>We tended to select it just after the initial call, so that the repairmen<br/>could discuss the relationship on the drive over.<br/></li><li>While the text wasn't clear, we played that when dividing mojo after a<br/>success, it was not an option to simply discard the third card, which seemed<br/>in line with the general pressure to make a deal or lose everything.<br/></li><li>Likewise, anywhere that the rules require a player to give up a un-used<br/>card, we weren't sure what to do in the event of being currently void of<br/>cards.  We played it as lucky: no further loss.<br/></li><li>We have a vague note about "what's at stake" regarding relationship<br/>challenges.  As it was, we sort of intuited reasonable in-fiction outcomes,<br/>but if there was one place where we weren't exactly sure how to proceed, this<br/>was it.<br/></li></ul>\nIt would be a shame that Business Solutions has languished so long, except<br/>that it was playing bridesmaid to Grey Ranks, which forgives many sins indeed.<br/><br/>I'll count on Mark and Josh to fill in details I might have missed.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90287/#Comment_90287" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-24T18:18:46+00:00" title="August 24, 2007  6:18PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mwah!

No idea whatsoever yet how well it works, but it suggested that (if it doesn't strain credibility) some sort of reuse of characters might flesh them out a bit.  Nothing says my humiliating relative can't be your grasping old flame, but at present, nothing says they ought to be.  I don't know what that suggests about relationship challenges - but knowing that some characters will recur might give an added impact to success or failure with them: "Your mom likes me better than you."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90353/#Comment_90353" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-25T06:31:53+00:00" title="August 25, 2007  6:31AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, that's intriguing - you know ahead of time which techs will visit which business, so it could be explicit that you collaboratively crafted the "relationship people" to target two player characters across two scenes rather than one, with entirely different relationships to each.  That adds a layer of complexity to it (instead of "angry authority figure targeting you!") but seems worthwhile.
