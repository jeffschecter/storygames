<div class="Message">
                    The very first time I went to The Forge, I encountered a thread titled something like "Killing Sacred Cows", which was all about asking some very fundamental questions about what was really necessary in an rpg, and what was simply in most designs by reasons of inertia.<br/><br/>It was mind expanding. I encountered ideas I'd never seen before. Character death optional? Distributed GM duties?! All kinds of good stuff.<br/><br/>So I'll bring up another Sacred Cow: The term, Roleplaying Game, and put it out there. Is it time to kill this one, too?<br/><br/>The history:<br/>As far as I can tell, the main reason the term even exists is because there were grumpy miniatures gamers who wanted D&amp;D, with its crazy hippy rules to go the hell away. So, between the folks pushing D&amp;D out of the miniatures wargaming hobby and the folks trying to define this "thing" which wa sdeveloping, someone suggested "role-playing game". I'm guessing an undergrad with some psych background, but who knows? The name stuck.<br/><br/>Well, much to the chagrin of the minis gamers, D&amp;D struck a bunch of right notes at the right time. And it grabbed an audience outside of the minis wargaming hobby.(It also gained a following inside the minis hobby, too. What's doubtful to me is thata the fans inside the minis and/or hex'n'chip hobby gave up their other pursuits. Rather, D&amp;D became another game they played, along with more then-mainstream games).<br/><br/>So why kill the term?<br/>Well, at one level, it cuts ties with baggage. D&amp;D and role-playing are intimately related. It's the "type" game that defines everything else. RPGs have taken off in all kinds of directions since D&amp;D made a splash, but at the end of the day, rpg=D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Dropping the term lets a game stand on its own.<br/>No more need of a "What is roleplaying?" section. Just tell players what they do in the specific game.<br/><br/>Dropping "roleplaying game" means the ability to recombine mechanics with other game types.<br/>You want a board or cards or text or whatever? Fine. No problem. You want aspects that you associate with RPGs? Also fine. Put 'em in. But you get to concentrate on what you want for that specific game without having to tie it in to any number of other games.<br/><br/>Gamers still Get It.<br/>Seriously. A gamer that likes rpgs will probably still see aspects of rpgs in your game, and like it for it. Players who've never seen an rpg can enjoy it without feeling like they need to get into the whole hobby.<br/><br/>Roleplaying Game sounds daft.<br/>It sounds uppity and exclusionary and elitist. We're talking about Play Pretend with some structure and maybe a bit of luck. That's damn fun. "Role Playing Game" is intimidating. Many times, in actual practice, mainstream rpgs are more like party games than wargames. And they're fun when they are. So why not run with that aspect?<br/><br/>Sometimes, Size Matters.<br/>But not the way you might think. The rules of most games are short. Really short. Monopoly is an aberrration for its length, and a bunch of the rules are on the cards or the board. Why have rpgs become so encyclopedic? Is it really necessary? Indie games tend to be much shorter than mainstream games, but even then we're still talking about an absurd length compared to most board games or card games or party games. The average book on Poker is shorter than most indie RPGs for heavens sake, and there's money on the line with that! Dropping RPG from the description inherently drops some of the assumptions of length.<br/><br/>Presentation.<br/>Dropping RPG as a term unshackles us in terms of presentation. RPGs are books. Okay, they used to be boxed sets, but today, they're books. Even Indie games tend to be presented this way. And not only are they books, but they're books with a certain kind of feel: Lots of text, few pictures. Like a technical manual. I freely admit, especially where indie games are concerned, that economics somes in here. But, damn!  Has anyone thought that the book presentaion is a barrier to wider acceptance? If you'd never encountered rpgs and taken them up as a hobby, can you seriously imagine yourself playing a game that had 50 pages of rules (much less 300 and an index!)with only afew illustrations? What is the length of rules you'd accept if you'd never seen an rpg? Would you ever consider playing something that required reading and absorbing a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">book</span> of rules?<br/><br/>Well there it is. I've ranted ( again). I think maybe it's time to stop fighting the good fight, stop grinding uphill, and go out and let the good games that are being made stand on their own. I don't think the games being made that I like so much even need the crutch of "roleplaying game" any more.                </div>

                            I like the term and think it aptly describes what we're doing: playing a game by taking on the role of a character in the story/adventure.  That said, I agree that you say "Role-playing game" and most equate it with D&amp;D.  This has helped me cross barriers because most people, even if they don't game, have at least heard of D&amp;D and so can get a glimmer of understanding of what I'm talking about.  However, a lot of games out there are not at all like D&amp;D.  What if we just switched and exculsively use "RPG"?  It worked for KFC.  :P  If we start using that term talking to *everyone* then perhaps it will catch on as a general title rather than a specific one.<br/><br/>As for books, I know people who love to read them and spend hours pouring over them.  I'm not one of them because I learn best by playing, not by reading.  As a result, Albert owns tons of rule books and I own very few.  Smaller books like Dogs, Polaris, Breaking the Ice don't impose so much upon me because they contain fewer rules and more scenery.  Maybe switching to simply "RPG" and <b>not</b> then explaing it as a "role-playing game" will help folks realise that there are games you can play (some with fewer rules than some board games!) without putting out 40$ for a huge book of rules.<br/><br/>--Nancy                        </div>

                            What if we started with "playing a game by taking on the role of a character in the story/adventure" and built rules from there, rather than being locked in by tradition?<br/><br/>That seems, to me, like a very good basis for a game.

                            HI komradebob,<br/>
<br/>
I'm all for killing this kill. (I've already discussed the matter -- as passionate advocate of the cow's death -- with Ron Edwards several time now.)<br/>
<br/>
Nancy,<br/>
<br/>
Here's my point of view about this: In games that are "playing a game by taking on the role of a character in the story/adventure," the label makes perfect sense.<br/>
<br/>
But what about Primetime Adventures. Or Sorcrerer. Or the Pool. Or a gazillion games out there right now that are as much about narration as taking on the role of <i>a</i> character.<br/>
<br/>
This isn't to say that these games don't have role-playing in them as part of the fun -- it's just that taking on the role of the character is not the focus of many of these games. (It is, however, a requirement of the game Puppetland.)<br/>
<br/>
And just as important, each player and each group will have their own feel and style and joy about what mix of being in the role and simply narrating events they feel comfortable with. I could successfully and in a very enternaining way, play a whole session of Call of Cthuhlu or AD&amp;D and never speak in character or say, "I do this..." Instead could spend the night say, "Tomak look down at the necklace half buried in the dirt, remembering his dead wife as his lifts it..." and all would be well.<br/>
<br/>
The label Roleplaying Game make it seem like the point of these games <i>is</i> to take on the role of the character. It isn't. It's one aspect of the game -- as determined by a mix of rules and playing style preference.<br/>
<br/>
I think it's a big turn off to people. Everyone tells stories. Not everyone knows how to "take on a role." (But note that, in order to tell a story, we often take on a role: "And then she was like, 'Well, FUCK! you bitch!,' and wasn't having any of that..." and so on.)<br/>

                            Just a side note that there are already games which do this.  <br><br>For example, as far as I know, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Polaris</span> never calls itself a role-playing game or uses the term "role-play" -- though other people have called it that.  Also, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cthulhu Live</span> calls itself a "live-action game" and doesn't call itself a role-playing game, to contrast it's  live-action nature with the terms RPG or role-playing that are associated with D&amp;D and tabletop play.                        </br></br></div>

                            I think roleplaying as a term has become obsolete with regards to understanding what it actually is. Yes, it's a perfectly viable description of what it is on one hand, but on the other it has become a catchall for almost anything imaginable.<br><br>Let's not kill it, the term is interesting for people in the know for historical reasons, let's just not use it anymore. We are a couple of people trying to get "normal people" interested in story games, and roleplaying would be the last word to use in that sales pitch <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br><br>There's a whole sub culture out there that will continue to use "roleplaying" and "RPG", don't worry, and they will probably continue many many years from now. Just look at rpg.net.<br><br>Per                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Meh.  <br><br>Even amongst indie games, the preponderance of them are concerned with the adoption of a single character role by a single player.  I don't see the label as being restrictive (especially mechanically), and in the end, the connotations are more helpful than hinderful (hinderful?).  I know there's this drive to shed all things D&amp;D and bust out of our chrysalis a shining new narrative butterfly, but the skills still port over and it's where we get most of our userbase.<br><br>I'm not suggesting that every game needs to call itself an RPG, but there's no need to ditch the term entirely, especially when there are plenty of indie games that are still ... well ...

                            The thing is, if all of Adventure Hobbying, Hippie Nar Yongering, and Sim-mers on Couches all dropped the term "Role-Playing Game", you know what that means?<br/><br/>It means that the only games that will call themselves Role-Playing Games would be those game console adventure games like Final Fantasy, Xenosaga, etc.<br/><br/>It's kinda funny, Story Games was just kinda thrown out there (IIRC, at one point on Clinton's old blog) as a term to adopt so that the hippie indie games weren't criticised by judgmental retards on the same playing field as D&amp;D (in terms of the goals of the designers, goals of marketing/sales, and goals of the actual activities of the games), but it somehow stuck.<br/><br/>Urology and Immunology are both "medicine", but they break apart the more you look at what they do. I don't mind leaving that vague "medicine" monniker of "role-playing game" out there, and just not really emphasize it as much, rather go with something else like "Adventure Game" "Story Game" "Tabletop Action Game" etc.<br/><br/>...but I'd probably still write "Roleplaying game" on it or somewhere in the description blurb, so that people could find it on Lulu searches and the like.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            On Luchacabra, I changed my "role-playing games" section to be called "live games." (The name was Dev's idea. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> )<br/><br/>I figure the primary medium of play for a board game is a horizontal surface, most often a board. For card games, it's cards. For what are usually called RPGs, the real medium of play isn't necessarily role-playing, but it <i>is</i> always an interaction between live people, usually in the same physical space. Granted, I only chose to do this because I needed a category to put my party games and alternate-reality games, but it seems apropos here.                        </div>

                            I like this idea -- in some cases.  I guess it depends on what kind of game you're making, and what sort of audience you want to market it to.  If it's a fairly similar game to D&amp;D and you want to market it to the same players, then sticking with "Roleplaying" might be a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
If it's more about narrating stories, or only uses some of the trappings of "roleplaying" in another format (eg. boardgame, cards, etc) then you might find that term less useful.<br/>
<br/>
"How To Host A Murder" could be called a roleplaying game, but it's marketed as a "murder mystery game" instead.                        </div>

                            Tony and Max, <br><br>Yep, marketing ploy. As someone noted, WotC has been moving towards D&amp;D being "adventure" not "roleplaying" and that's pure market angle. (And, I'd say, a good one.) In this sense Max's post is right on the money. <br><br>Also, rhetorical ploy. Used in the sense of "we will exclude you from what we are doing because it is/is not this specific but vauge thing." View this on RPG.net any given Sunday. In this sense Max's post misses the part where geeks use the term to clusterfuck each other in increasingly stupid ways. <br/><br/>So, for both of those reasons killing it can be a good thing (if you marketing so directs) in the sense of where it places emphasis towards commnity building outside the actual play table. I tend to worry about it only in so much as people try and use it to pull power-dynamic shit against me.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Fair enough.<br/><br/>PTA by the way does this, I don't think it uses the term roleplaying once although it does still clearly talk you through how to do it if it interests you without using the term.  It's a very impressive bit of writing, as a roleplayer I can see what he's talking about but there is none of our terminology.<br/><br/>I'd suggest checking it out if this appeals, plus it's a great game anyway.                        </div>

Definitely.  If we're talking marketing rather than impact on play then I think the term has limited utility, and may even be counterproductive.<br/><br/>That said, you don't need to kill it.  Just not use it in your game.                        </div>

Well, yes, but I also meant that by thinking of your game as its own thing first means not having to pound that square peg into a round hole. While lots of indie games are really interesting ( to me) because of structural/mechanical differences from the main line of rpg develoment, there are still a bunch of mental vestigal organs floating around.<br/><br/>The ones that strike me most are:<br/>Gamerspeak<br/>Presentation as a book<br/>Presumption of play around a table<br/>Presumption of the Never Ending Game ( not so much, that one, but still lurking at the edges)<br/>Rules length ( I hate to say it, but sometmes it still looks like padding going on, so that games will be accepted by capital G Gamers)<br/>Emphasis on text as the primary means of conveying info.<br/>Avoidance of artifacts of other game styles, such as boards or cards( again, not as much, but still there)<br/>Marketing to a gamer market primarily                        </div>

See how these go together? And you can buy a "murder mystery game" in bookstore, toy stores, gift stores, airports, etc. What's the difference? As I see it, the <a href="http://mystery.host-party.com/" rel="nofollow">How to Host a Mystery</a> series<br/>-comes in a box<br/>-includes pregenerated characters that you might get before you even get there, so you can dress accordingly<br/>-is intended as a 'one-shot'<br/>-is a module with tight storylines<br/>-suggests props and a menu<br/>-plays out as a LARP rather than a table-top, we all sit down and just talk type RPG.<br/><br/>What can we learn from this in terms of marketing RPGs? (And does that involve getting rid of the name?) I like the option of saying "No, it's more like How to Host a Murder, or like improv theater"                        </div>

                            Boulevard is coming in a box.<br/>Instead of a book, there are some booklets, and some of the special-rules cases will be represented on cards or special-rules cases sheets.<br/><br/>So that everything is a bit more fiddly, but a bit more accessible and stuff.<br/><br/>Also, I don't know that I'm using "game" at all. I have no aversion to "role-playing" in this case... But something that involves pointing guns at the other participants and ranting on sensitive issues hardly qualifies as a game to me.<br/><br/>It'd be like calling Requiem for a Dream a "fun thing to watch with your friends."<br/><br/>So... in my case, I don't want to use RPG because:<br/>a.) It's not a typical RPG presentation. It includes props and might include card/board game elements.<br/>b.) I am not writing a game.<br/>c.) It is not d&amp;d, and those expecting d&amp;d would be harshly disappointed.<br/><br/>I am not sure what to call it, but RPG is LARGELY misleading.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Roleplaying Game sounds daft.<br/>It sounds uppity and exclusionary and elitist.</blockquote>Well, no. It sounds like some game focused on the role you are playing. You may take any daft term and make it uppity by the way you talk about it. If the attitude of the players is bad, then any term will be bad too. Try to be inclusive in your game design, even when you use the term "roleplaying game".<br/><br/>And don't be afraid to use other terms too. I'm writing a series of nine simple roleplaying games now, under the label "Theatre for everybody!" I expect that label to draw some attention from non-gamers, and that's what you are aiming at, really. Use whatever you need to get it out there, but stop short of selling your own inheritance. I find the inheritance of "roleplaying game" to be very good.

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>Will removing (or for that matter maintaining) the "roleplaying game" label change how I play my games?  Like ...<b>at all</b>?</blockquote>
Perhaps not how you play, but it can change how you design your games if it forces you out of your comfort zone. I've been trying to do that quite a bit lately by taking cues from, of all people, Mark Burnett, producer of <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/survivor13/" rel="nofollow">Survivor</a> and a few other reality shows. Say what you want about the state of television these days, but Mark Burnett is the most successful game designer of the past decade. I mean, the actual play reports are <i>nationally televised.</i><br/><br/>We were talking about this a little bit at GenCon this year and, who would've thunk it, Wired Magazine released an <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,71581-0.html" rel="nofollow">interview</a> with the guy at the very same time. My measure of a good game is the number of anecdotes that come out of the shortest possible amount of time. If you can get the same number of anecdotes as an episode of Survivor in roughly the same amount of play-time, that's a pretty good situation. That may mean the game is so divorced from "role-playing" that the term barely applies, but that's okay.<br/><br/>Do you need to play a character to make an anecdote? Do you need a shared imaginary space? Do you even need to buy a book, physical or otherwise? Maybe not. It can't hurt to explore.<br/><br/>(Personally, I prefer the Amazing Race, created by Elise Doganieri and Bert Van Munster.)                        </div>

<p>Rather than talk about whether "roleplaying game" is a marketing term or not, or some of the other issues that have been raised, i'm going to focus in on one thing that isn't being discussed that really <em>is</em> a sacred cow.</p>
<p>Nancy wrote:</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>I like the term and think it aptly describes what we're doing: playing a game by taking on the role of a character in the story/adventure.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>And others, such as Tomas, have said things in agreement with this: a roleplaying game is a game in which you play a role. I've even said it myself, at times, in other places. But should we accept this, or is it holding back creativity?</p>
<p>The characteristic that defines an RPG isn't playing a role, but playing with tokens and a gameboard that partially or completely exist in the imagination instead of as a physical artifact, which means they can be modified in play. The non-RPG they truly most resemble is Nomic, with its modifiable rules. It's what distinguishes early D&amp;D, which didn't mention roleplaying at all or really require that players act out their roles, from wargames and minis. It's even present in games that attempting to borrow from board games instead of minis, such as The Fantasy Trip.</p>
<p>Although playing a role may be the easiest way to play this kind of game, it doesn't have to be the only activity in the game. Things like collaborative setting creation and shared characters are attempts to explore modification of the group fiction beyond the familiar. There are certainly other ways we haven't even thought of yet.</p>
<p>To what extent does the term "roleplaying game" inhibit exploring these other ways?</p>

<p>I am not sure this is like, a workable analogy at all. An hour's worth of anecdotes in a solid, uninterrupted week of play? <em>Sure.</em> I will do that with the least directed, least rewarding game you can think of.</p>

                            My analogy was a little muddled. I didn't mean that players would have the same ratio of play-to-anecdote as the actual production of a real tv show. I meant having the same amount of anecdote you as a viewer would get from watching an episode of the finished program. (People gather around the water cooler all the time to talk about the most recent episode of this show or that.)<br/><br/>That's the bare minimum amount of anecdote a game should provide for the time it takes to play since there's a LOT of other entertainment media competing for gametime. That's just reality shows though, that's not even counting serial dramas like Battlestar Galactica, etc.                        </div>

                            I like the marketing point. This is how you break out of the ghetto. <br/><br/>Look at Michael Crichton. He writes fiction which involves (very well-researched) science, extrapolated a bit to create an interesting situation. But does it say "science fiction" anywhere? It does not. So people who wouldn't be caught dead reading "sci-fi" devour his stuff eagerly.<br/><br/>But it's science fiction. He just painted over the logo.                        </div>
