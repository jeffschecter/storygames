And I've never really been comfortable with the "randominess" I feel is brought into the game by the 20-sided-die-for-almost-everything resolution system. Maybe it's because I spent my formative years playing bell-curve style initiatlized games, like GURPS and possibly FUDGE, but I think in the light of the 4th edition's "skill challenges", I have begun to see it as wholly at odds with what the rest of the game, mechanically speaking, seems to be on about.<br/><br/>Which is to say, that the entire rest of the experience in playing D&amp;D seems to be about careful/lucky management of limited resources - drinking the potion, spending the action point, consuming a spell/power - with the lone exception of this oddly fundamental mechanic that everything else hinges around. In yet more other words, if the core fun of the game is choosing when to use that kick-ass spell power (or whatever) it seems to me that randomly deciding that I don't get the benefit of that core fun because of random bad luck is a sign of something acting at cross purposes to something else.<br/><br/>Worse, as far as I'm concerned, in these poorly constrained "skill challenge" events, I find that I, in the player's chair, often have little to no resources to spend in my attempt to influence the outcomes. Outside of a few classes' utility powers, I don't really see much in the game at large that's generally useful as this kind of resource. (In previous editions of the game, there were various home remedies for Hero Points or Action Points, that could be used to improve one's chances; 4th edition has official Action Points, but they're largely useless in a skill challenge event.) <br/><br/>I think I have a solution, and but I could desperately use some helpful advice. Maybe it shows that I've been playing a lot of Dominion lately, but this idea starting to percolate in my head some time after I read about Robin Laws' Poker Skill Challenges.<br/><br/>The next time I GM this game for people, I plan to replace the d20 with a small pack of cards, one pack of cards for each player. The pack of cards might be numbered, or use some kind of color-coding, but either way it would have cards for the numbers 1 through 20 (eg, color coding would mean: black suit 1-10, red suit 11-20). Each player would, at the start of the session, draw a small hand of cards, and play a card from their hand whenever they would normally roll a d20 (eg, attack rolls, skills, saves, etc.) (Powers that involve a re-roll would flip over the top card of the player's deck.) A la Cosmic Encounter, the player doesn't draw any new cards until all the cards in the current hand have been played.<br/><br/>My intent is to reduce (without entirely eliminating) moments of lopsided, unfun randomness while also providing the player with a new kind of "resource choice" mechanic. The hand of cards introduces an element of sacrificing future victory for victory now, and I like that this might produce "how much this victory is worth" kinds of tension -- a tension I think I largely lack when playing this game (certainly in the game I'm a player in right now, at least). I think that moving to a completely non-random element would do too much to reduce other fun elements of the game -- or, maybe, that the semi-antagonistic player-GM relationship we all tend to skirt when playing depends, at least a little, on a character occasionally being able to succeed well beyond estimation. And too many elements of the game hinge on things like critical hit rolls to be removed entirely without amounting to a dramatic change in the nature of the game.<br/><br/>I'm primarily interested in trying out various hand sizes, and am suspicious that an auspicious number lies somewhere between 3 and 7. I actually suspect that you'll want fewer cards with more players (and vice-versa) -- more players have more resources to bring to bear, and a greater ability to "aid another", or find another character with a better skill rank, or better hand, thus watering down any potential for tense decision making. It might also be interesting to try playing with a 40-card deck (numbered 1-20 twice), or to try removing a number of cards randomly, face down, from the deck before play.<br/><br/>Oh - finally - this is a player-focused mechanic. I think the GM should still roll dice, primarily because the GM, as narrator, already has a generous ability to constrain randomness. In other words, since the GM can always throw more problems / tougher problems at the players, I don't think she needs any particular help in this regard. Although it might be worth saying that I'm already a big fan of using Fantasy Oracle / Harrow / Everway -type resources in conjuring up new challenges.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242718/#Comment_242718" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-19T10:01:38+00:00" title="November 19, 2009 10:01AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Keep bumping this thing, I'm SURE I recall someone trying this exactly.<br/><br/>I used to play a lot of the Marvel Saga / Dragonlance Saga (i.e. card-based) systems, and having crappy cards often leads to the players doing stupid stuff to discard... like looking at you intently and saying "So... do I see any gold?" and stuff to get you to call for a perception roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242721/#Comment_242721" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-19T10:33:04+00:00" title="November 19, 2009 10:33AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 19, 2009 3:41PM by johnzo.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Joshua:<br/><br/>&gt; My intent is to reduce (without entirely eliminating) moments of lopsided, unfun randomness<br/><br/>Another strategy is to not let the dice provoke unfun results -- to ensure that no matter what random outcome the d20 produces, there's a fun result flowing from it.  I think that this is easier in skill challenges than in combat, because in combat the results of a failed check are dictated by the rules.  But in skill challenges, the result of a check failure or challenge failure can be *anything* that either doesn't grant the roller's intent, or that grants the roller's intent in a complicated or perverted way.<br/><br/>As a 4E DM, I always always try to have interesting failure outcomes for skill checks thought up before the roll, and if I can't think of one, then I'll generally just grant the player what they want.  (edit: or I'll kibbutz with the table on what an interesting failure outcome might be.  It's easier to be a DM when you've got a bunch of assistants helping you be evil!  Some players may not be into this kinda thing tho.)<br/><br/>Also echoing Mr. Stout'n: I've played Castle Falkenstein, which uses a similar card scheme, and we had to have a formal agreement at the table that people wouldn't slough off crap cards on nonsense / meaningless situations.  Without that agreement, the game kinda degenerated.  Now, this was easy in Falkenstein because we were all civilized ladies and gentlemen who welcomed structure and shunned churlishness.  I don't know if D&amp;D has the same social contract.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>I hope this doesn't come across as a dismissive threadcrap, and apologize for discussing your proposed mechanic so slightly.  I'll think more about my Falk experience and if I come up with anything that might be helpful, I'll let ya know.  Good luck!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242762/#Comment_242762" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-19T13:59:44+00:00" title="November 19, 2009  1:59PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I seem to recall it suggesting in a DMG at some point in history just replacing all the d20 rolls with 3d6 rolls.

I have had my players roll several d20 rolls in advance. Usually around 10, but there's no reason you can't do more.  For fun, I also give them an extra 1 and 20 on top of it (actually, the second time I offered just a 20, and they protested - they wanted the 1 as well!)<br/><br/>They tend to use the good rolls first, and then mid-to late stage is spending the bad rolls - the good thing is they can toss them on at-wills or saving throws or use powers that have good secondary effects not reliant upon hitting a target, or decent miss results.<br/><br/>When they run out of pre-determined rolls, they start using regular rolls.<br/><br/>They love it.  It also speeds play up by a good degree.<br/><br/>Incidentally, I do the same thing except that I build up a lot more rolls and I've said that I'm not allowed to go out of order.

Replacing the d20 with 3d6 (even 2d10 would help) is the only thing that would help the fundamental issue the OP is complaining about.<br/><br/>BTW, it wasn't in a DMG, it was in Monte Cook's 3rd Edition Unearthed Arcana that he suggests swapping in 3d6 for the d20.  Great book, lots of cool stuff in it.  If you use 3d6<br/><br/>Also, if you go with the "stack of cards" idea instead of dice, have the players place a reshuffle card four or so cards from the bottom.  That way there's no guarantee of that 20 or that 1.  (I got this idea from the version of Settlers of Catan that replaces the dice with cards, a considerable improvement over the base game.)<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short" title="Lee_Short"><img alt="Lee_Short" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short">Lee_Short</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242816/#Comment_242816" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-19T20:31:48+00:00" title="November 19, 2009  8:31PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you are talking about replacing the d20, you do less violence to the system by using 4d6s, each numbered 0 to 5.
