With this origin in mind it may not come as a surprise if mechanics present in D&amp;D are considered very naturally fiction-associative, while mechanics foreign to that tradition are considered disassociative. I am uncertain whether it's possible to say anything more about the disassociativeness of game mechanics except that people like what they are used to, and there's a difference between gamers in whether they react positively or negatively to new things. Take a bunch of people with a similar gaming background and a conservative mindset, and you could even get the impression that there really is some sort of disassociation phenomenon behind their consistent dislike of certain types of games, when the cause might instead be simply that they all like the same old games.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nI'll try to mount a defense for the concept of "disassociated mechanic" as a useful one. Let us see how this goes.<br/><br/>1. Some rules are clearly and obviously tied to fiction; strength score and creature size being extreme examples.<br/><br/>2. Some rules, like 13th age style resting (rest once every 4 encounters; the number might be wrong), are quite disassociated from the fiction.<br/><br/>3. An associated (non-disassociated, whatever) mechanic allows the participants to guess the game mechanical interpretations of various things in the fiction, or at least not be surprised by them.<br/><br/>Given a description of a monster, different people can give it strength scores and they will probably be in the same ballpark, and they can have a discussion about how strong a monster should be (by comparing it to other monsters and considering that it can lift a carriage and so on).<br/><br/>In a similar way, in a noisy clockwork dungeon, if a game master says that it is not possible to get a long rest because the clanking makes sleep impossible, this is more likely to be accepted by the players than an arbitrary explanation (the dungeon has blue walls so no sleep), and, in fact, clever players might have considered the possibility as soon as they got to know that the dungeon is noisy.<br/><br/>On the other hand, monster hit dice (or level) is fairly disassociated - for big monsters one can use their body mass as some kind of indicator. But what about new and unique undead and demons and such?<br/><br/>Likewise, Adam's mechanic seems fairly disassociated. Is it about fatigue? If so, getting tired, in general, should help one learn, and that should allow getting similar bonuses. Pressure? Does having my boss yell at me give similar bonuses? If magic changes my emotional state, then does it also change the relevant bonuses?<br/><br/>4. Disassociation is partially a matter of not having a good explanation that the participants accept. There is a reason why D&amp;D people have figured out explanations for alignment, hit points (that work as long as poisonous bites are not considered), and so on.<br/><br/>5. Some disassociated mechanics are fairly harmless (EDIT: for the purpose of not rewarding disruptive in-game behaviour, as per the next sentence; this is obviously not relevant for games where one is not playing the fiction and the rules for their advantage). These are the ones that do not suggest disruptive behaviour of the characters. Adam's rule is, I guess, fairly harmless in this sense. Giving experience for finishing goals or finding treasure and so on is harmless in this sense, and beneficial for giving structure to the game. Giving experience for killing things (and not overcoming them otherwise) is harmful if one does not want to play a game of monster hunters, because it suggests what is presumably undesired behaviour (seeking and fighting monsters for the sake of doing so).<br/><br/>6. Generally speaking, for traditional games, less disassociated mechanics is better (EDIT: consider two rules that are otherwise equivalent, except one is associated and the other dissociated). a. It allows aligning player and character goals. and b. It allows fiction-based problem solving. Many traditional games have elements of both a. and b., in varying degrees.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Well said.

In this approach you get inside your character\u2019s head and figure out what they would do.<br/><br/>Second, you can <i>create a story</i>.

However, I'm not at all convinced that a clear line can be drawn, since many/most game mechanics operate at varying levels of abstraction (but almost all lean on abstraction at *some* level).<br/><br/><i>(To clarify what I mean: consider a hypothetical "fatigue" rule. In one version, we decide when a character might be tired, based on the fictional circumstances, and when the character is tired, we assign a penalty of -1 to all his rolls. This is subjective and rather binary*, but otherwise most people wouldn't find it at all "dissociated". <br/><br/>In a second version, every character gets 5 Fatigue points, and when something tiring happens - which might include using the awesome bow ability - the character loses one. At zero Fatigue Points, the character can no longer attempt cool feats like the awesome bow ability (presumably they automatically fail, instead). Would anyone find this mechanic "dissociated"? Perhaps, perhaps not. <br/><br/>In the third version, we "zoom out" a little more and say that, generally speaking, we don't care about tracking other kinds of general fatigue, so let's assume a character generally goes through about 4 Fatigue points in a day, which leaves one to use the "awesome bow ability". We don't want to track the Fatigue points anymore; our ruleset has slimmed down so that we can remove the points altogether; their only remaining mechanical impact of interest to us is how it limits the character's awesome ability. So, having removed the need to track the (other) points, the final rule we write is, "The character can use his awesome bow ability once a day", since that's a fair general abstraction of what we used to get with the "5 Point Fatigue Pool" rules. As a result, the rule hasn't changed a great deal, but, presented in this format, I think many more people would label it as "dissociated".<br/><br/><br/>*: For instance, we could get into a funny discussion where we decide that hiking 9 miles is just fine, but hiking a 10th would make you Tired. What about hiking 5 miles at a time, then? And so on. Even a rule like this can create weird situations in play where your awareness of the rule makes it impossible to consider the fiction without taking into account metagame knowledge of how the rules work and how the participants apply them.<br/></i><br/><br/><br/>Although I have gotten much better at doing this over time (and with practice), I still find sometimes that particular types of dissociated mechanics annoy or confuse me until or unless I can find a way to rationalize what they are or why they function the way they do.

Run these through the definition above, and you will find that of them, really, only hit points, inspiration, and roleplaying XP fit.  Of those three, HP is complained about a lot and a lot of gamers that spin off from D&amp;D looking for "more realistic" combat cite this one, so it's safe to say that it's below some people's threshold.  Inspiration and XP for roleplaying are, IMHO, rules that see very little use at a lot of tables.

Anecdotally, the only time I've seen the term come up is in discussions of D&amp;D 4e. Not once have I heard it applied to storygames or even previous editions of D&amp;D despite the long history of dissociated mechanics in D&amp;D (as <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> notes). <br/><br/>My perspective is:<br/><br/>1. The formatting of D&amp;D 4e laid bare the mechanical framework of the system in a way that exposed its dissociated mechaniccs. Previous editions' more naturalistic language made them more palatable. "A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down."<br/><br/>3. The divorce of D&amp;D 4e from its traditions introduced dissociated mechanics that many D&amp;D players had not internalized, unlike things such as level and class restrictions. They balked at this.<br/><br/>How you want to view the term is ultimately your perspective. I myself believe The Alexandrian was discussing the concept in good faith when he coined the phrase, and in usage, the term "dissociative mechanics" is entirely devoid of value judgment in the way that describing D&amp;D as "feeling like a videogame" is not. It is merely descriptive.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">@JDCorley</a>:\n<blockquote>By the time you get to "mechanics" you have already fully dissociated yourself from the fiction - you have handed over control, and therefore, authority over, the fiction to a distant designer. It doesn't matter whether they tell you to roll 3d8 or pick a card from a deck. It is as dissociated as it will ever be.<br/></blockquote>\nThe difference is that such resolution mechanics (flawed, abstract, and crafted in a way that fails to model any sort of reality) have a concrete basis for their existence. The iconic (and often denigrated) Armor Class comes to mind. The mechanics represent the likelihood of an individual's armor to shield him from harm, taking into account various fictional factors: the armor's material and construction, the defender's natural ability to dodge, any sort of enchantments upon it. All of that directly ties directly into the fiction in a way that something like, "You can attack an enemy twice, but only once per day, and then you you have to use the ability that allows you to attack an enemy and then an ally can spend a healing surge."<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/hyades">@hyades</a>:\n<blockquote>If you think of the fiction only in terms of obstacles, maybe some mechanics appear dissociated because they're not telling you how easy or hard sth is for your character or just don't care (that's what "guess the game mechanical interpretations" means, right?).</blockquote>\nThere are plenty of story-oriented games with associated mechanics. I consider all of Apocalypse World's moves to be associated (and most PbtA spin-offs have associated mechanics). Fate's Aspects are associated. BitD's position mechanics are associated. Burning Wheel's advancement system is associated.

If the fiction is realistic, this is related to realism.\n<blockquote><br/>How is "once every 4 encounters" disassociated ?<br/></blockquote>\nBecause it is not tied to fiction in any way - why would one regain powers after every four encounters? How is encounter defined in the fiction? If you provide answers to these questions, then you have associated the rule. Then one can think of it in terms of sacrifices to the blood god or gathering v\xe4ki which allows recharging power or whatever, and has a way to reason about whether fighting amongst ourselves is an encounter and is it a good idea and so on.\n<blockquote><br/>Are there no ways of aligning player and character with "disassociated mechanics" ?<br/></blockquote>\nI do not understand the question.\n<blockquote><br/>Wasn't this old concept, suspension of disbelief, good enough for you ?<br/></blockquote>\nSuspension of disbelief is about how believable something is. Dissociation is about the relation between the rules and the fiction. There are obvious not connected if the fiction breaks suspension of disbelief.

Also, I believe dissociation, like almost everything in life, is a matter of degree. Clear line is not necessary for a concept to make sense or be useful.<br/><br/>For the fatigue rules: If we understand where the abstraction is coming from, and are willing and capable of breaking the default of one power per day, it remains associated. Like if you are starving under the hot desert sun, maybe you have no powers left, or if you are fully relaxed and come out to demonstrate your superior archery skills, you can use a special maneuver five times a day.<br/><br/>It is a beautiful feature of roleplaying games that one does not have to use the same level of abstraction all the time.\n<blockquote><br/>Generally, it seems to me that people don't "mind" dissociated mechanics if they are familiar and comfortable - it's only when they're "weird" or new that people even notice.<br/></blockquote>\nYes, if you are used to something, you are more likely to tolerate it. Also, you may have developed explicit or implicit ways of aligning the rules with the fiction, and just grit your teeth or make jokes about it when there is mismatch. There are many coping strategies.\n<blockquote><br/>Otherwise how do we explain D&amp;D fans complaining about "dissociated mechanics" in a new version of their favourite game, all the while spending years happily playing a game which has hit points, character classes and levels, alignments, experience points, Inspiration, experience bonuses/penalties for good or bad roleplaying, formulaic rules for learning and knowing spells, languages, and other forms of lore, and so forth?<br/><br/>(If I were genuinely concerned about this issue, any game I play or design - with a goal of avoiding "dissociated mechanics"  - wouldn't look ANYTHING like D&amp;D.)<br/></blockquote>\n1. Consider my notion of harmless disassociate mechanics, point 5 in the opening post. Inspiration, for example, is far more harmless than Fate points are, because you can not and need not stockpile it to create alpha strikes. It does not affect the play as much.<br/><br/>2. Many people manage to use D&amp;D for games with lots of fiction-based problem solving play. This type of play requires quite associated mechanics. Empirically, it is doable.

To me, this suggests that the strangeness (disassociation?) of the rule was a known phenomenon.<br/><br/>13th level thief as a shopkeeper is a more matter of realism or suspension of disbelief or preferences than anything disassociated, as far as I see.

I would appreciate if you took the culture wars and gripes about former discussions to another place, such as another thread, if the subject is within the bounds of this forum.<br/><br/>4. From a previous thread I understand that you play in a way where dissociated mechanics is quite irrelevant, as you do not really use rules that simulate the game world, and you agree ahead of time about the big lines of play and then play to act out and see the details.

In particular, I doubt the tastes of Ron as are limited as you claim they are, and I think GNS gamism is a very real thing, probably more so than the other categories. Discussing Ron's preferences here is tangential and you can just ask him, so I think returning to that point is not a good idea. I doubt a GNS discussion would help clarify the matter at hand in this thread, either, so I would suggest dropping the matter in this thread. Feel free to start a new one, if you want to discuss it further.<br/><br/>I can somewhat see why some people do dislike the term, but I do not care too much about that. The question is whether the concept makes sense or can be defined so as to make sense, not whether people like it or how they have used it. Those tangential subjects would be better in other threads, if someone asked for my opinion. I also do not particularly care that the term stems from preferences and trying to explain them; that is a very good reason to create new terminology.<br/><br/>I am still interested in critique of the definition I try to provide in the opening post, or alternate suggestions for definitions, or useful example cases, and so on.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478031/#Comment_478031" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-23T21:17:06+00:00" title="November 23, 2018  9:17PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 23, 2018 9:17PM by Thanuir.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Khimus" rel="nofollow">Khimus</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I think it's a matter of perspective, as has been pointed out. To me, there are few things as "disassociated" as hit points, levels, turn structure and initiative in d&amp;d, and yet it is cited here as an example of associated to the fiction mechanics. For most roleplayers, this classical wargamer representation of combat is the most natural, and will complain like hell when exposed to, say, fight in BW, which to me represents quite well The chaos of combat.</p></div></blockquote>\nIn the original post I used hit points as something people have managed to explain reasonably well, but there are still holes there. I mentioned levels as an explicit example of dissociated mechanics. I think you are the first to bring up turn order and initiative, but I have had other things to think about so maybe I or someone else mentioned them and I just forgot and can't find them.<br/><br/>Burning wheel extended fight mechanics are as associated as anything else. (Though the realism of planning up to half dozen moves at once is doubtful. But realism is a separate matter.)<br/><br/>Hence, I am confused by your examples.\n<blockquote><br/>In the end, all mechanics support a particular narrative, and there are certainly tons of possible narratives about how a combat goes, how healing, magic, advancement, go. So I guess a mechanic would only be dissociative if it contradicts the fiction style the game supposedly conveys. Can't think of an example of that right now, though.</blockquote>\nI think is an orthogonal matter; mechanics can and do support or contradict styles of fiction, but that is a different issue from them being tied to and explainable within the fiction at all.<br/>For example, a rule that says that any acrobatics a human has ever done are possible for all characters is quite associated, while one where you have acrobatics tokens that you use to make acrobatic tricks and you regain when NPCs do the same the GM has a similar pool that they use would be dissociated, i.e. require lots of contrived explanations to make sense of and probably still fail even then. However, both of these would be a good fit for a game where lots of acrobatic action is presumed, and a bad fit for other types of games.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DeReel" rel="nofollow">DeReel</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Is it like "example A - the Driver in Apocalypse World always having an escape route is how he sees the world", as opposed to "example B- the pool of dice in Lady Blackbird is just spotlight management" ?<br/><br/>If this is so, EmmatheExcrucian is spot on.

When there comes a situation with no obvious escape route and the roll succeeds, the group has to decide how to handle it - either there an escape route after all, even though nobody noticed it before (this is only questionable if the presence of potential escape routes had been carefully inspected before and potential ones should have been found; this causing problems would be rare, in my experience), or the ability gets treated as supernatural and described in such a way, which has its own potential consequences, as one would expect interaction with the psychic maelstorm every now and then.<br/><br/>The personal pool of dice in Lady blackbird, which gets more dice when you fail at rolls, does seem hard to associate.

That yields better result than ignorance.<br/><br/>You answer point by point. This shows an effort. Sadly, it takes the form of a "social" effort (answering every letter is polite) rather than an intellectual effort (defining your object would be the bare minimum). I think it would be clearer if we'd all work under the same frame. Can you bring a definition of "associated rules" first ? You may now have noticed that your points number 1 and 2 are begging the question. That maybe the reason why so many people in the thread are emoting pulling their hair. (Note that number 3 is more interesting in that it provides a practical test)<br/>"I tried to give a useful definition (more solid than mere taste) in the opening post." <br/>"I would appreciate criticism of the definition I am provided or alternate useful definitions." <br/><a href="/forums/profile/Airk">@Airk</a> "Let's talk about the definition in the first post." =&gt; <a href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/995/821/3c8.jpg" rel="nofollow">WTF ?!</a><br/>Flowery prose and all you really don't know what you're saying. There is no definition there !<br/><br/>Later, and only then, you could show evidence that it is something that exists. <br/>Later, we could work what "dissociation" means. That will then be easier. And if we arrive where I think we will (that is : dissociation is "everything not X when X is the way to go"), I'll be able to show you what my ABC business was about. But you may already have an idea and I am sure you won't need a picture when we'll get there. Which will save me the trouble of saving your soul :P I have reasons and big neon lit clues to think I know where this thing goes because of the judgements in your points number 5 and 6. Notice the contrast between how the term is poorly defined and the judgements precisely aimed, and you will have made a big step toward my understanding of the question.<br/><br/>And I'll show good faith bringing to the table what I have gathered with the most favorable interpretation : I am under the impression that "associated rules" are rules that simulate the "physics" of the fiction ? that make it explainable ? explained ? The whole process of applying some sort of scientific method to rules leads me to think that. See : "Is it about fatigue? If so, getting tired, in general, should help one learn, and that should allow getting similar bonuses. Pressure? Does having my boss yell at me give similar bonuses? If magic changes my emotional state, then does it also change the relevant bonuses?" please validate or invalidate this interpretation. <br/><br/>You must note that sometimes the definition has seemed to vary - maybe because Katana shares your goal, but not your definition. Examples of "dissociation" were then justified by virtue of the effect of "dissociation" on a person (like : I don't see a link to fiction, I can't explain it, etc.) So what kind of phenomenon are we talking about ? an objective one or a subjective one ? Surely, point number 4 in the OP points at subjectivity, but the "partially" really doesn't mean a thing. Is it just rhetorical precaution or do you think you have gotten your hands on something that "transcends subjective and objective" ? <a href="http://bladerunner.wikia.com/wiki/Voight-Kampff_machine" rel="nofollow">Listen to your heart when you write, but check your logic before posting</a>.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478033/#Comment_478033" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-23T22:43:10+00:00" title="November 23, 2018 10:43PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 23, 2018 11:05PM by DeReel.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "allow a player to rely solely on an in-character perspective while playing the game."

I hope you don't mind being piled by angry storygamers.<br/><br/>I don't personally have a gripe with the definition of disassociation you present here (I don't know what's difficult about it), but I'm interested in its applications: do we simply believe that there is an underlying preference for strongly fiction-associating game mechanics in some gamer demographics, and that's why one should attempt to "simulate the game world" wherever possible, or does the concept have some further implications? Or, stated in a more pointed manner: is there a theoretical point to the distinction?<br/><br/>In my own experience I am most dissatisfied by incohesive game mechanics when the rules, taken as a whole, do not paint an unified picture of a single player's tasks and responsibilities in the game. This means that I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing moment to moment in the game, and I can't enjoy the activity because I don't know if my participation is appropriate to my role. It's not even "I don't like this activity" - I'm generally pretty flexible - but simply "I don't know what this activity is even supposed to be". This is not mechanical disassociation in the narrow sense, but mechanical disassociation seems like it could be a subcategory of "role incoherence" like this in some situations: the player comes into the game thinking that their job is to simply "play their character" or "participate in the adventure", and then they're thrust into making authorial decisions from a story level perspective. I could see how this would be jarring.<br/><br/>I'll note that as far as I understand, disassociation theorists generally seem to be fine with the GM having and using disassociated mechanics, as long as they're not talked about openly. Many rpgs, after all, draft the big picture on the GM side with arbitrary structural mechanics.<br/><br/>Following that thought, I wonder if it's possible for some people to see mechanical disassociation as an obvious problem, while for others it's not that relevant, because of an array of hidden assumptions each person brings to their gaming. As a simple example, a gamer who really rather dislikes game mechanics in general and most favours in-character immersion in games might well latch onto the idea of mechanical disassociation because associated mechanics are easier to leave for the GM to worry about. This would explain why such a gamer would see mechanical disassociation as meaningful; not because it's such a clear-cut and dramatic difference in how a game plays, but rather because it sounds nicer than "I don't want to bother with game mechanics" does.<br/><br/>Or, as an opposite example: I don't immediately see the fault-line of disassociation as crucial, as I don't really, truly buy into immersion as a goal of play. As far as I'm concerned, it's exactly as Jason said upthread: all mechanics are an interface <i>anyway</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478041/#Comment_478041" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-24T08:46:59+00:00" title="November 24, 2018  8:46AM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 24, 2018 10:44AM by DeReel.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's difficult is it wasn't presented in the first place and shifted repeatedly during discussion. Only those with previous knowledge are finding it obvious. Do you see what's wrong ? You jump to discussing desirability when the object is not even there. I don't question the purpose now, only the method.<br/><br/>If you understand "association" then please explain : is it objectively in the rule or is it subjective ? Are associated rules the "physics" of the fictional world ? Is it about physics or verisimilitude ? The "clear and obvious" examples all imply physics. The less obvious ones reach for metaphysics. I am beginning to suspect it all ends in verisimilitude because the other things are longer to explain. That is : it's a rhetorical object, conveniently malleable, of which people say it's good or bad before they even consider what it IS or would be. That's crazy.<br/><br/>As for the pragmatical approach, again : what's the use of explaining the rules to the characters ? Consider R\xeave's metaphysics : characters know their world is dreamed by remote powerful beings. That's the players. All the rules are associated. End of story. Don't you see this is silly ?

I think it is very peculiar.<br/><br/>I'd like to thicken the line between reality and fiction for the clarity of the discussion. <br/>When you say : "(A character does not know he is \u201clow on HP,\u201d but he can perceive his own weariness and understand that he is more likely to make a fatal mistake as he fatigues in combat.)" Do you mean like this is the way it works in real life (delusion) ? or that it is credible and that's enough (verisimilitude) ? or that is what the Hit Points model, disregarding how it works in real life and how you feel about it (physics) ? <br/><br/>What's the link I am missing between verisimilitude and physics, given "realism" has been very clearly and repeatedly barred from the equation ? If you know what you are talking about, if this is obvious to you, I am ready to take my lesson. Why delay it for so many pages ?

It is also a useful tool when designing games and tinkering with them, when one has priorities that benefit from associated mechanics.<br/><br/>You have not yet explained why the concept is "unmitigated bullshit". This would actually add to the discussion.\n<blockquote><br/>Its still nonsensical, of course. Daily powers are "disassociated" because if we scrutinize them with a fine-toothed comb they don't make sense but hit points are just "abstract" because hey don't just think about it too hard? Virtually every mechanic in D&amp;D would look "disassociated" if scrutinized to the same level of detail as daily powers.<br/></blockquote>\nPersonally, I do not think that daily powers are particularly dissociated; there is no explanation given, but one is very easy to give. It is probably a discussion that happens when there is an attack at night or early in the morning - do characters have their powers or not?\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Khimus" rel="nofollow">Khimus</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>"2. Many people manage to use D&amp;D for games with lots of fiction-based problem solving play. This type of play requires quite associated mechanics. Empirically, it is doable.

What they're saying, and I agree with them, is that not even classic d&amp;d can resist the scrutinize of this theory. And citing the experience of players who enjoy the game seems like a poor argument to me, as pretty much the same could be done for d&amp;d4th and story games.</p></div></blockquote>\nYes. See point 5 in the opening post for a part of the answer - games where the dissociated mechanics do not cause problems in play work fine, most of the time, even if they are intellectually unsatisfying (as evidenced by plenty of discussions about hit points, peasant railguns, and so forth).<br/><br/>Another part of the answer: Just because a game has dissociated mechanics does not imply that adding more of them does not have effects.<br/><br/>My argument is not that people enjoy play. Here is the argument I tried to write in response to Paul, extended and more explicit:<br/><br/>1. There is at least one style of play that requires that rules are fairly associated. This would be OSR-style challenge-oriented games with focus on fictional problem solving. (There are doubtless others, but this is one with which I am quite familiar). Please ask if it is not clear why this style of play requires rules to be fairly associated.<br/><br/>2. This is often played with D&amp;D-type rules, which often have hit points, classes, levels, combat rounds and so forth. Including fifth edition of D&amp;D. Claim is based on experience and online reports both.<br/><br/>3. Hence, there is empirical proof that the rules in question are not so severely dissociative as to make the activity terribly difficult or impossible.<br/><br/>This is not related at all to players of other games enjoying or not enjoying them - that would be relevant if I claimed that dissociated mechanics make all kinds of play more difficult, which I do not believe. If I have claimed it, point it out and I'll take it back or explain myself more clearly.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DeReel" rel="nofollow">DeReel</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I have a hard time closing doors. <br/>We can agree on 2097's way of associating stuff : PCs live in a world where hit points exist.<br/>In your answer to me about the "4 encounters" case you say association is the action of linking mechanic to fiction via explanation. Do it if you want, the way you want. It is of no use to me, for playing or for designing.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nI think 2097's way is only a partial solution for people who want their mechanics associated. It treats the level of abstraction as fixed and sacred. Typically illogicalities happen when this is done, as, for example, the combat rules of most roleplaying games assume a short small group skirmish. The same rules might work reasonably in that context, yet create strange results in a sprint, archery contest, chase scene or an army-level war.<br/><br/>Various rules in the style of setting stakes are a fine way of getting past the problem. Many traditional roleplaying games are designed so that the abstractions work well in many situations. The "rulings, not rules" mantra of OSR solves the same problem.<br/><br/>Also, it is completely fine if you do not find the concept useful.

Assume at least one person is roleplaying (in the broad sense; "play a roleplaying game", not "speak in funny voices" or "speak in character"). I'll refer to them as "the player"; GM and such probably included.<br/><br/>2. Assume there is fiction (diegesis if you prefer) shared by the participants in the play. By shared, I mean that they can, most of the time, agree about fact statements concerning the fiction, and they can build more fiction that they deem consistent with what they have already established.<br/><br/>3. Given a rule that affects the fiction or is triggered by the fiction, and given a player, we can ask how associated or dissociated the rule is for the player. This can be extended to rules that affect or are triggered by other rules that directly affect or are triggered by the fiction, and so forth, but those tend to be automatically dissociated anyway.<br/><br/>Examples of rules that affect the fiction: "When a player draws a card, the building shows new signs of collapse." "Anyone reduced to -3 hit points is dead."<br/>Examples of rules that are triggered by the fiction: "When hit by a weapon, take damage equal to its power." "Regain all daily powers at dawn when the first light of the new sun touches your forehead."<br/>Examples of rules that do both: "Anyone stung by the spelling bee must cast a spell that requires the use of speech." "No wizard may wield a sword." <br/><br/>The last last one has the trivial empty trigger, as it is always in effect, or maybe it has the trigger of someone being a wizard. The precise classification of it is not relevant. In general, dividing rules into triggers and effects is also not important, here; what is important is how directly they are connected to the fiction.<br/><br/>Examples of rules that affect the fiction through a circuitous route: "If you draw the highest card, give a plot token to whoever drew the lowest card." "Change the game master after each session." <br/><br/>4. A rule is associated for the player when it corresponds to the events in the fiction. That is: It has an interpretation in the fiction and the interpretation is consistent with future and past fiction.<br/><br/>A rule is dissociated for the player when the correspondence to the fiction does not exist. That is: The rule lacks an interpretation in the fiction, or the interpretation is not consistent with future and past fiction.<br/><br/>This is a continuum.<br/><br/>An example of a highly associated rule: Strength score and strength checks in traditional roleplaying games. Interpretation: Character with a high strength score is strong in the way a person in real life is strong (depending on other attributes and what cover) - a character with high strength has easier time carrying and throwing heavy things. We would expect them to do better than a weak character in an arm-wrestling contest, even if the game lacks exact rules for such.<br/><br/>Another example of highly associated rule: Wizards learn spells by writing them in a spellbook and prepare them with the help of the spellbook. Interpretation: By analogy to such activities as cooking complicated meals or writing and executing computer programs. Consistency: If the wizard loses their spellbook, then they can no longer prepare spells. It requires time to learn a new spell, and some writing materials.<br/><br/>Example of a highly dissociated rule: Character gains a story token whenever one is used against them. This has no single obvious counterpart in the fiction (but see point 5, below), or an obvious real world analogy. The rule, as written, could happen completely outside the fiction.<br/><br/>Example of a moderate dissociated rule: "Barbarian can rage once a day to gain +4 to strength." Here, "+4 strength" has a clear fictional interpretation, being a barbarian may or may not have one depending on the details, and once a day leaves room for interpretation - when or under what conditions does the ability recharge and why? Without further specification, there are several different alternatives and they have different consequences. If hormones manufactured by a small widget inside the character create the effect and the widget takes 24 hours to make more, then messing with hormone levels or removing the widget could weaken the effect, while building a better widget or adding more of them could enhance the ability. Careless use might lead to all effects of hormone imbalance and misuse. On the other hand, the "once a day" might just be an abstraction of getting tired and only managing such effort once a while. Then, optimal or awful environment might change the frequency.<br/><br/>5. A rule can become more associated by giving it an interpretation. If the new interpretation is consistently used, then the rule has become associated. See above for examples, as well as discussions about the meaning of hit points, Vancian magic and the wealth rules in Burning wheel.<br/><br/>6. The definition above is for a single rule and a single player. There is an obvious extension to several people (such as a game group or gaming subcultre): Whether and to what extent their interpretations exist and are mutually consistent.<br/><br/>A further extension to hypothetical rules, or rules not known by many (useful when designing a game, for example): Would the the group one is interested in (such as "all roleplayers") come up with similar and mutually consistent interpretations for the rule?<br/><br/>This is as objective as a book or lecture being easy to follow and understand is objective; though there is murkiness, there is much that can said that applies to most people.<br/><br/>7. The concept of associated mechanics is useful at least for the following people:<br/><br/>A. People who want their game to be about players engaging in solving fictional problems by fictional means and thinking. Dissociated mechanics retract from this by making the fiction less predictable and by offering non-diegetic tools and restrictions to the problem solving.<br/><br/>B. People who use a game whose rules affect the fiction, and who want to have vivid and non-jarring mental images of what happens in play. With associated rules, everything discussed in terms of rules is also, at the same time, discussed in terms of fiction.<br/><br/>Obviously: If one is using entirely formal rules about scene framing and right to narrate, then this is not a concern, as the rules have very little chance of contradicting the mental images.<br/><br/>C. Character immersion with heavy rules. My info is second hand, here, so I would prefer to not speculate about these people. I would be interested in hearing from any of them.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I feel like I forgot to write something here, but I'm sure someone will let me know.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Some commentary: Since I, and hopefully some others, are here to work out a definition, of course it will change and mutate and there will be several versions. The goal is to see if a good definition can be made and, if so, what it will look like. After further discussion it is possible to formulate a better suggestion, which is what I am doing here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478051/#Comment_478051" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-24T13:57:10+00:00" title="November 24, 2018  1:57PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 24, 2018 8:59PM by DeReel.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you for your effort. So it's about players, not characters. That I can understand.  I am not nitpicking, so your point 3 is not important for me, but it may avoid problems with nitpickers, so good.<br/><br/>What I wanted is the 4a. "The rule lacks an interpretation in the fiction" don't you mean "representation" ? Again, the interpretation is at the level of the player. So, if there is "a presence of the rule" inside the fiction. Or did you mean there is someone "understanding" the rule in the fiction ? I think you left the character outside, so it must be "presence of the rule". Do you mean material presence ? certainly not by the use of magic example. So it must be physical presence, in the sense that "forces", be them gods, thermodynamic or magic are the "physics" of the world.  I have the same question with 5, which only rephrases 4a : is the interpretation given to the player, or to the character ? I suppose to the player because if a character doesn't know magic, it can still be part of their world. So the interpretation in the fiction must be : "an interpretation by the player that relies solely on fictional elements". <br/>"Associated rules are rules (whose effects ?) the player interprets as fictional elements." <br/>I had "whose effect", because, if the rule is invoked but has no effect, does it count ? I'd count it had we defined the thing as "breaking immersion", but if the rule has no effect, there's nothing to explain in fiction...<br/><br/>roll - miss - "Damn my luck !" (says the character / the player indifferently, when we all know that no such thing as Luck exist, but the only thing that counts is : it's believable)<br/><br/>So, it's about lightening the player's effort for information management and transposition, right ? If this is so, I suggest you abandon this term, "associated" for reasons Rickard already mentioned : <br/>- its history only troubles the water <br/>- its vagueness (associating how ?) and the fact that it deals with an abstract subject (reality / fiction) makes it easy to misunderstand in an exchange<br/>- it is therefore plausible that the definition is not consistent among various groups<br/>- and my main point : there are better terms out there, that weren't coined by someone from the hobby, but apply as well. An "intuitive" vocabulary and pertinent analogies is a plus for any game. Every designer of mathematical games goes through this step of finding the analogy that will make their rules accessible in an elegant and fruitful way. For instance, playing Go as "circling enemy territories", "taking hostages", etc. The problem with checkers : Abalone found the solution turning pawns into cows : nice !) There is nothing specific to RPG in there. Using the proper concepts would give time to think about the part specific to RPG, that is : the actor stance. Or is it that specific (see Paradox of the actor) ? <br/><br/>And, look, I think I made it thanks to your help !

Burning wheel Bloody versus is more abstracted than Fight; one resolves things with more detail than the other. Both are highly associated (I hope this is clear). However, if we take a concept like Fate points (dissociated because there is no obvious unique interpretation), then it is meaningless to discuss how abstracted it is without first interpreting it, i.e. associating it.<br/><br/>If rules are used as physics of the game world, than they are obviously associated due to that use. However, because such rules are by necessity abstractions, this is likely to lead to unrealistic consequences; whether this is a problem or not is up to the group.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" rel="nofollow">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>First of all, I\u2019d ask you to keep your tone in check.

Or, stated in a more pointed manner: is there a theoretical point to the distinction?<br/></blockquote>\nYes, I think there are a number of styles of play which benefit from many rules being associated. I named a few in the previous post. If you disagree or the connection is unclear, please ask.\n<blockquote><br/>In my own experience I am most dissatisfied by incohesive game mechanics when the rules, taken as a whole, do not paint an unified picture of a single player's tasks and responsibilities in the game. This means that I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing moment to moment in the game, and I can't enjoy the activity because I don't know if my participation is appropriate to my role. It's not even "I don't like this activity" - I'm generally pretty flexible - but simply "I don't know what this activity is even supposed to be". This is not mechanical disassociation in the narrow sense, but mechanical disassociation seems like it could be a subcategory of "role incoherence" like this in some situations: the player comes into the game thinking that their job is to simply "play their character" or "participate in the adventure", and then they're thrust into making authorial decisions from a story level perspective. I could see how this would be jarring.<br/></blockquote>\nI would say that the issue of not knowing what one is supposed to do in play (not finding a creative agenda) is a separate issue, though coming the dissociated rules conflicting with creative priorities might be common. Out-of-character narrative rights tends to make solving fictional challenges trivial, for example.<br/><br/>More generally, if one wants to feel like there is a fictional world that they are exploring (as or via one's character), then dissociated mechanics are unlikely to contribute and might be detrimental.\n<blockquote><br/>I'll note that as far as I understand, disassociation theorists generally seem to be fine with the GM having and using disassociated mechanics, as long as they're not talked about openly. Many rpgs, after all, draft the big picture on the GM side with arbitrary structural mechanics.<br/></blockquote>\nAs an OSR referee, I prefer mechanics to be associated, since that makes it easier to make rulings faithfully to the world and thus hygienically.<br/><br/>This might be true for any style of play that calls for the game master to simulate and channel a solid and consistent world, but is probably not true for most other styles of play.\n<blockquote><br/>Following that thought, I wonder if it's possible for some people to see mechanical disassociation as an obvious problem, while for others it's not that relevant, because of an array of hidden assumptions each person brings to their gaming. As a simple example, a gamer who really rather dislikes game mechanics in general and most favours in-character immersion in games might well latch onto the idea of mechanical disassociation because associated mechanics are easier to leave for the GM to worry about. This would explain why such a gamer would see mechanical disassociation as meaningful; not because it's such a clear-cut and dramatic difference in how a game plays, but rather because it sounds nicer than "I don't want to bother with game mechanics" does.<br/></blockquote>\nThe first claim is certainly true. The example sounds reasonable as a mechanism by which someone might enjoy associated mechanics. I am uncertain about why it is not a clear-cut and dramatical difference in how the game plays. Would you expand on what you mean by that?\n<blockquote><br/>Or, as an opposite example: I don't immediately see the fault-line of disassociation as crucial, as I don't really, truly buy into immersion as a goal of play.

I realized that the design made people look at it from a new perspective. That's how I think about DnD 4ED.<br/><br/>During a walk, I thought about this topic, and it seems like (some) people are used to going out and into mechanics as well as acting in character, because that's how typical roleplaying games are set up. There is usually nothing in a traditional roleplaying game system that supports acting in character, or even as the character. Some parts, like combat rules, even disrupts the immersion ... but as the articles fro The Alexandrian stated: \n<blockquote>Traditional roleplaying games, like D&amp;D, are based around the idea of players as actors: Each player takes on the role of a particular character and the entirety of play is defined around the player thinking of themselves as the character and asking the question, \u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d<br/><br/>Because of this, resolution mechanics in traditional RPGs are action-based.</blockquote>\n<a href="https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/1545/roleplaying-games/dissociated-mechanic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/1545/roleplaying-games/dissociated-mechanic</a>\n<blockquote>I\u2019m going to make a provocative statement: When you are using dissociated mechanics you are not roleplaying. Which is not to say that you can\u2019t roleplay while playing a game featuring dissociated mechanics, but simply to say that in the moment when you are using those mechanics you are not roleplaying. [I think the author means, "playing roleplaying games", otherwise this doesn't make any sense]</blockquote>\n<a href="https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/17231/roleplaying-games/dissociated-mechanics-a-brief-primer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/17231/roleplaying-games/dissociated-mechanics-a-brief-primer</a>\n<blockquote>Another way to look at this is to strip everything back to freeform roleplaying: Just people sitting around, pretending to be characters. This isn\u2019t a roleplaying game because there\u2019s no game \u2014 it\u2019s just roleplaying.<br/><br/>Now add mechanics: If the mechanics are designed in such a way that the mechanical choices you\u2019re making are directly associated with the choices your character is making [<i>taking actions</i>, my remark], then it\u2019s probably a roleplaying game. If the mechanics are designed in such a way that the mechanical choices you\u2019re making are about controlling or influencing the narrative, then it\u2019s probably a storytelling game.</blockquote>\n<a href="https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/6517/roleplaying-games/roleplaying-games-vs-storytelling-games" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/6517/roleplaying-games/roleplaying-games-vs-storytelling-games</a><br/><br/>It seems to me that the author is used to switching between these states of mind \u2013 making choice based on mechanics or character \u2013 and doesn't seem to notice the switches. For LARPers, this jump between choices based on mechanics and choices based on the characters' views are more apparent.<br/><br/>I think it's dangerous to mix these two together, and call it <i>associative mechanics</i> to explain a preferred playstyle, just as I think mixing several things together to call something <i>immersion</i>.

Or artha, where certain character actions trigger meta game currency gain the player may then use to improve his rolls. Both, especially the camp phase actions, are totally disconnected from the fiction but, at the same time, totally necessary to the tone and atmosphere the game is trying to convey. And both make Torchbearer (and Burning Wheel) amazing games on their own.<br/><br/>I have found players usually fight these rules at first, or take some time to adapt to them. But it's not a rules issue, it's because players are only accustomed to one type of relationship between rules and fiction. Those same players can go through a d&amp;d combat without anything disrupting their "immersion". What I'm saying is that a concept that depends on a particular demographic of players and mostly with their inability to deal with different games doesn't seem useful to me, especially not from a design perspective. Those players should get accustomed to different types of rules, as many are (inspiration in d&amp;d 5th), or simply stay with their games. But many of us want rules that push us out of common places, and for me at least such a concept has no use. I'd rather be interested in debating what does the camp phase in TB produce in play, than if any rule is hard to explain in the fiction.<br/><br/>A quick note: I've reached "immersion" playing Monsterhearts, a game with tons of rules that are disconnected from the fiction. My players have achieved similar levels of engagement with dungeon world or Burning Wheel, too. I think immersion as a term is, as ass/diss, also problematic, because it tends to imply that only a certain style of play allows for such an intense engagement, and also implies some ideas about how a game should be designed. I'd talk instead about engagement with the activity, and thus I don't agree with the idea that disassociated rules make this engagement more difficult.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478067/#Comment_478067" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-24T20:07:15+00:00" title="November 24, 2018  8:07PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 24, 2018 10:07PM by DeReel.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now I see what is association.

It came out of the early arguments about 4th edition, and was an attempt to explain why some people didn't like many of the powers in the game. At the time, it wasn't about story or narrative mechanics. It was just about abilities some players felt were disruptive to their immersion for some reason, and Justin Alexander provided an explanation that made quite a bit of sense to folks at the time (at least it made sense to people who were not super enthused about 4th edition). He's elaborated and tried to clarify the concept since. I think if anything, most of us who were critical of 4E at the time, and who found the Alexandrian's concept useful, would have said our issue with 4E was its gaminess (not its narrative or story qualities)---in fact, I didn't even hear about people using it for narrative stuff until years later.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478080/#Comment_478080" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-25T06:10:33+00:00" title="November 25, 2018  6:10AM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think <a href="/forums/profile/DeReel">@DeReel</a> says it well here:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DeReel" rel="nofollow">DeReel</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Now I see what is association.

However, in my experience, it falls apart immediately in practice if two players who aren't coming from a VERY similar background and aesthetic try to apply it. <br/><br/>I've yet to see any "definition" which could be reliably applied in the same way by two different people.<br/><br/>(As can be seen by some people defending D&amp;D by comparing it to other games with more "dissociated" mechanics, whereas others feel the need to redesign the same game from scratch because the rules are too dissociated -\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" rel="nofollow">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Why can't I try to parry an attack?

Another one might be, "Do I perceive the nature of the fictional world/adventure/story we are experiencing to operate under any narrative concerns, or only some?" For example, perhaps it doesn't bother me that battlefield wounds don't get infected or that swords don't need sharpening, because I don't *expect* those things in this style of story/reality I'm playing out. So I'm OK that in our game the rules never produce a chance of dying from infection. However, I also perceive the idea that "good triumphs in the end, and nihilism is not the nature of heroic fantasy" is a fundamental aspect of the diegetic world and the 'reality' of being a fantasy hero, so the idea of a character going "from zero to hero" and having very low odds of death are totally in line with my sense of verisimilitude. Someone else might balk at one but not the other.)<br/><br/>Having said that, here's my take on "dissociation":<br/><br/>It's a high-brow and abstract attempt to deal with a very real, and, sometimes, unpleasant phenomenon:<br/><br/>* You're playing a game and try to make choices from your character's perspective... when you realize that you must modify these choices because of the way the rules work.<br/><br/>If you are able to rationalize these changes in your behaviour in a way which allows you to maintain the illusion of verisimilitude, everything is fine.<br/><br/>If you are unable to do so, you are suddenly torn between doing the thing which seems natural and organic and "right" and following the rules accurately.<br/><br/>That's when something feels "dissociated".<br/><br/>For my tastes, this comes up ALL THE TIME in D&amp;D, so I find it hilarious when D&amp;D players are offended about "dissociated mechanics", but for some people the assumptions of D&amp;D play are so deeply ingrained that it doesn't seem to bother them.<br/><br/>Some classic examples:<br/><br/>* The villain is sitting, with his back to us, and we want to kill him. We sneak up and decide to slit his throat from behind.<br/><br/>However, the villain is a 9th-level Wizard, so we know that slitting his throat, at most, will just deplete some of his hit points.<br/><br/>However, one of the characters has the Backstab feat, so he could actually hurt him significantly this way. So, now, that character should be the one to do, regardless of other fictional considerations.<br/><br/>* You're a high-level warrior, walking unarmed through the palace gardens. The King's guards suddenly surround you, pointing crossbows at you. "King's orders; you are under arrest for treason. Surrender, or we shoot!"<br/><br/>You look at your sheet and realize that, even if they all hit, you could walk away basically unscathed (losing a small fraction of your hit points), and, because of the way the initiative and movement rules work, you'd get away before any of them could load a crossbow for a second shot.<br/><br/>Indeed, one of the reasons I moved to more " narrative" rules for a lot of my gaming was precisely to avoid such moment of "dissociation". PbtA games, for instance, rarely (or almost never) produce such awkward moments in play for me, despite having, on paper, far more "dissociated" rules.<br/><br/>(As a perfect illustration, when I play <i>Apocalypse World</i>, the main source of dissociative moments for me is the harm rules, which are the most "simulationist" and least "narrative" aspect of the rules - they rate weapons and armor in numbers based on how likely they are to kill or protect you: the closest that game gets to "physics sim" in terms of its rules. I don't think that's a coincidence.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478083/#Comment_478083" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-25T07:49:22+00:00" title="November 25, 2018  7:49AM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 25, 2018 7:58AM by DeReel.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At last we are talking of dissociation as a psychological state. It has little to do with a rule property, or only accidentally. Missing a detail in a description by the GM is dissociating. (Not understanding because the fictional element lacks). Of course, hordes of internetian could grab such a proteiform concept and use it as a bludgeon. When all the time the lumber was in their eyes. Ouch.<br/><br/>One thing with the concept is that it cleaves through all my functional concepts : I can see many solutions to the problems it helps to solve, but I think it bundles so many things it is not practical. <br/>For instance : sometimes you will have to correct the abstraction level for realism, clean the murk with a map, sometimes you will have a discussion with the symptom player about their expectations about the game, etc.<br/>The very fact that players evoke the sciences of the fictive world is typical of an interest in the simulation. Like in Archipelago, if the Ocean player states there is a certain species of fish used for navigation, the fact is established for future,  past and present  It's a "mini game" I propose in my game for the Thinker players. But it has little to do with what I consider the rules, actually. It is rather a mode of play, something that the rules allow. I never had to use a funny word to explain this. Except maybe "establish" ?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Dissociated mechanics - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21865/dissociated-mechanics/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Dissociated mechanics - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21865/dissociated-mechanics/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Also, to correct a misconception about narrative games.

Narrative elements are meta-fictional. This means they are also fictional, by definition. <br/><br/>They are those fictional elements that are meta-stable. I could translate this into "they are how things are, disregarding the details" or "they are not the state, rather the rules of things" and how we talk about these rules. But I'd rather the one who doesn't understand do some research than take me as a teacher. <br/><br/>Improv and many narrative games thrive on problem solving. They simply deal with elements like Karma or "The role you've been framed in" rather than HP and traps. To me, they look much more like real life in this respect. In many of its uses, the term "dissociated" is therefore a strawman, used by people confused by the abstraction of "meta". Hence my plea for a definition.<br/><br/>With the new definition, I can tell : It is subjective, it is about realism, it is about abstraction in certain aspects. So I don't understand why we were repeatedly told otherwise since the start of the thread. And I understand why I was pulling my hair. I suspect these terms (realism, abstraction, etc.) were made taboo or unclear by the ghosts of their uses in older discussions. I have no control over this. Having done my homework early in this thread, I have read disgusting threads, mixing delusion, fallacies, good faith, etc. Let the "ass/diss rules" concept rest. It brings nothing good.<br/><br/>Like Paul_T I'd be very interested in the psychological concept of dissociation seen through TTRPG lenses.

It came out of the early arguments about 4th edition, and was an attempt to explain why some people didn't like many of the powers in the game. At the time, it wasn't about story or narrative mechanics. It was just about abilities some players felt were disruptive to their immersion for some reason, and Justin Alexander provided an explanation that made quite a bit of sense to folks at the time (at least it made sense to people who were not super enthused about 4th edition). He's elaborated and tried to clarify the concept since. I think if anything, most of us who were critical of 4E at the time, and who found the Alexandrian's concept useful, would have said our issue with 4E was its gaminess (not its narrative or story qualities)---in fact, I didn't even hear about people using it for narrative stuff until years later. </div></blockquote>\nI don't really care about it's original purpose and interpretation. I'm interested about the how the terminology is defined now, even if I had to read all the three articles a couple of times to form a conclusive thought about it.<br/><br/>As I said, some of the game mechanics are disruptive too, but I used other examples (immersion, storytelling) in attempt to show this. I really like <a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana%27s">@ValyrianSteelKatana's</a> questions because they  shows how people are used to sliding in and out of certain game mechanics: "Why can't I try to parry an attack? Why do I need a feat to Cleave two goblins at once? Why does a healing spell heal the wizard more completely than it does the fighter?" ...<br/><br/>... but the <a href="https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/17231/roleplaying-games/dissociated-mechanics-a-brief-primer" rel="nofollow">Alexandrian primer</a> recognize this: \n<blockquote>Ultimately, this explains why so many people have had intensely negative reactions to dissociated mechanics: They\u2019re antithetical to the defining characteristic of a roleplaying game and, thus, fundamentally incompatible with the primary reason many people play roleplaying games.<br/><br/>Does this mean that dissociated mechanics simply have no place in a roleplaying game?<br/><br/>Not exactly.<br/><br/>First, dissociated mechanics have always been part of roleplaying games. For example, character generation is almost always dissociated and that\u2019s also true for virtually all character advancement systems, too. It\u2019s also true for a lot of the mechanics that GMs use. (In other words, dissociated mechanics are frequently used \u2013 and accepted \u2013 in the parts of the game that aren\u2019t about roleplaying your character.)</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478093/#Comment_478093" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-25T12:10:26+00:00" title="November 25, 2018 12:10PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 25, 2018 12:59PM by DeReel.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Isn't it clearly absurd to say that creating your character is not about roleplaying your character ? <br/>And what is to say about the "intensely negative reactions to dissociated mechanics" when these "dissociated mechanics have always been part of roleplaying games" ?<br/>Enough syntactical distance and they lose sight of the most elementary logic.<br/>"virtually all character advancement systems" (are dissociated mechanics) This is so <i>ad hoc</i> to the D&amp;D crowd it's silly.<br/>"The mechanic is dissociated because the decision made by the player cannot be equated to a decision made by the character" This is (a call to) delusion right there ! <br/><br/>There never was a sound concept there.

However, in my experience, it falls apart immediately in practice if two players who aren't coming from a VERY similar background and aesthetic try to apply it. <br/><br/>I've yet to see any "definition" which could be reliably applied in the same way by two different people.<br/><br/>(As can be seen by some people defending D&amp;D by comparing it to other games with more "dissociated" mechanics, whereas others feel the need to redesign the same game from scratch because the rules are too dissociated -\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" rel="nofollow">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Why can't I try to parry an attack?

Another one might be, "Do I perceive the nature of the fictional world/adventure/story we are experiencing to operate under any narrative concerns, or only some?" For example, perhaps it doesn't bother me that battlefield wounds don't get infected or that swords don't need sharpening, because I don't *expect* those things in this style of story/reality I'm playing out. So I'm OK that in our game the rules never produce a chance of dying from infection. However, I also perceive the idea that "good triumphs in the end, and nihilism is not the nature of heroic fantasy" is a fundamental aspect of the diegetic world and the 'reality' of being a fantasy hero, so the idea of a character going "from zero to hero" and having very low odds of death are totally in line with my sense of verisimilitude. Someone else might balk at one but not the other.)<br/><br/>Having said that, here's my take on "dissociation":<br/><br/>It's a high-brow and abstract attempt to deal with a very real, and, sometimes, unpleasant phenomenon:<br/><br/>* You're playing a game and try to make choices from your character's perspective... when you realize that you must modify these choices because of the way the rules work.<br/><br/>If you are able to rationalize these changes in your behaviour in a way which allows you to maintain the illusion of verisimilitude, everything is fine.<br/><br/>If you are unable to do so, you are suddenly torn between doing the thing which seems natural and organic and "right" and following the rules accurately.<br/><br/>That's when something feels "dissociated".<br/><br/>For my tastes, this comes up ALL THE TIME in D&amp;D, so I find it hilarious when D&amp;D players are offended about "dissociated mechanics", but for some people the assumptions of D&amp;D play are so deeply ingrained that it doesn't seem to bother them.<br/><br/>Some classic examples:<br/><br/>* The villain is sitting, with his back to us, and we want to kill him. We sneak up and decide to slit his throat from behind.<br/><br/>However, the villain is a 9th-level Wizard, so we know that slitting his throat, at most, will just deplete some of his hit points.<br/><br/>However, one of the characters has the Backstab feat, so he could actually hurt him significantly this way. So, now, that character should be the one to do, regardless of other fictional considerations.<br/><br/>* You're a high-level warrior, walking unarmed through the palace gardens. The King's guards suddenly surround you, pointing crossbows at you. "King's orders; you are under arrest for treason. Surrender, or we shoot!"<br/><br/>You look at your sheet and realize that, even if they all hit, you could walk away basically unscathed (losing a small fraction of your hit points), and, because of the way the initiative and movement rules work, you'd get away before any of them could load a crossbow for a second shot.<br/><br/>Indeed, one of the reasons I moved to more " narrative" rules for a lot of my gaming was precisely to avoid such moment of "dissociation". PbtA games, for instance, rarely (or almost never) produce such awkward moments in play for me, despite having, on paper, far more "dissociated" rules.<br/><br/>(As a perfect illustration, when I play <i>Apocalypse World</i>, the main source of dissociative moments for me is the harm rules, which are the most "simulationist" and least "narrative" aspect of the rules - they rate weapons and armor in numbers based on how likely they are to kill or protect you: the closest that game gets to "physics sim" in terms of its rules. I don't think that's a coincidence.)<br/><br/></div></blockquote>\nI was going to post, but this here is already a perfect expression of my own thoughts. Thanks, Paul. <br/><br/>It's amusing seeing people get bothered by "Healing Surges" while being perfect fine with "Spells per Day", "Classes" and "Levels".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478098/#Comment_478098" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-25T13:48:07+00:00" title="November 25, 2018  1:48PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 25, 2018 3:23PM by DeReel.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a> Of course, when there is no character yet, or no fictional element, there can only be "dissociated things".

"The rule lacks an interpretation in the fiction" don't you mean "representation" ? Again, the interpretation is at the level of the player. So, if there is "a presence of the rule" inside the fiction. Or did you mean there is someone "understanding" the rule in the fiction ? I think you left the character outside, so it must be "presence of the rule". Do you mean material presence ? certainly not by the use of magic example. So it must be physical presence, in the sense that "forces", be them gods, thermodynamic or magic are the "physics" of the world.  I have the same question with 5, which only rephrases 4a : is the interpretation given to the player, or to the character ? I suppose to the player because if a character doesn't know magic, it can still be part of their world. So the interpretation in the fiction must be : "an interpretation by the player that relies solely on fictional elements". <br/>"Associated rules are rules (whose effects ?) the player interprets as fictional elements." <br/>I had "whose effect", because, if the rule is invoked but has no effect, does it count ? I'd count it had we defined the thing as "breaking immersion", but if the rule has no effect, there's nothing to explain in fiction...<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nI am not sure of what the difference between interpretation and representation would be, here.<br/><br/>If a rule represents something, then it has an obvious interpretation. If a rule has an interpretation, then, at least often, I think it can be said to represent those things.<br/><br/>But this is getting awfully abstract and handwavy. It would help if you gave a concrete example, real or not, of the difference.<br/><br/>I think the trigger or the effect of the rule can both be associated or dissociated. If the rule has no effect whatsoever, even indirect effects, on the fiction, then it should just be removed as it does not contribute.\n<blockquote><br/>So, it's about lightening the player's effort for information management and transposition, right ? If this is so, I suggest you abandon this term, "associated" for reasons Rickard already mentioned : <br/>- its history only troubles the water <br/>- its vagueness (associating how ?) and the fact that it deals with an abstract subject (reality / fiction) makes it easy to misunderstand in an exchange<br/>- it is therefore plausible that the definition is not consistent among various groups<br/>- and my main point : there are better terms out there, that weren't coined by someone from the hobby, but apply as well. An "intuitive" vocabulary and pertinent analogies is a plus for any game. Every designer of mathematical games goes through this step of finding the analogy that will make their rules accessible in an elegant and fruitful way. For instance, playing Go as "circling enemy territories", "taking hostages", etc. The problem with checkers : Abalone found the solution turning pawns into cows : nice !) There is nothing specific to RPG in there. Using the proper concepts would give time to think about the part specific to RPG, that is : the actor stance. Or is it that specific (see Paradox of the actor) ? <br/></blockquote>\nLightening information management is one good effect of associated rules, indeed.<br/><br/>I have discussed some other effects in previous posts: aligning player and character understanding (related to actor stance), enabling fictional problem-solving play without strange consequences that dissociated rules often bring in such use.<br/><br/>Downsides should be obvious at this point: Dissociated mechanics allow a far broader design space.<br/><br/>I am not interested in historical discussions or possibilities of misunderstandings here; though if someone has a better term that avoids those problems, feel free to mention it.<br/><br/>Discussing an abstract subject is unavoidable if one wants to discuss them, which I find interesting and useful. This will doubtless cause some people to not be able to participate due to abstractness, but that is fine; they can think harder and practice, or not participate.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DeReel" rel="nofollow">DeReel</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>In the end it's a game of wack-the-mouse : someone brings up a rule he can't interpret in fictional terms, and someone else tries to shoehorn the rule into fiction. <br/><br/>This is supposed to be "quite dissociated" : "Character gains a story token whenever one is used against them." These characters are fortune's fools in a story, and this simulates poetic justice. Or they live in a world where Karma really exists. The proof for the character is that more often than not, one action is "repaid" by another. Have I associated the rule for you ? If so, it was rather easy. Of course, the more complex and absurd the rules, the more difficult. But absurd and complex rules are bad design to begin with, so there's that.</p></div></blockquote>\nYes, the fact that you must specifically expend effort to associate a rule tells that it was dissociated to begin with. And the fact that there are discussing where people do this, like think what hit points mean, shows that it is an important concept for many.<br/><br/>A similar argument: "System does not matter. I can house rule it to work anyway." "Yes, and the fact that you bother make those house rules shows that the system indeed matters."<br/><br/>For the karma example: Religious scholars in the world might have great insight on how it all works out, or at least I might want to ask questions about it if playing one. If everyone has karma and plot tokens, then maybe I can write an subtly inaccurate trollish comment on Twitter and have lots of people angrily refute me, thereby getting a bucketload of plot tokens. If only some people have them, then maybe there is some way of identifying them. And so on. If you really and honestly associate the mechanic, then these kinds of questions and actions should be within the spirit of the game; otherwise why associate the rule at all?<br/><br/>That is: If you just want a reliable mechanism for everyone having equal spotlight time or whatever, you are probably better off with a blatantly dissociated mechanic.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478102/#Comment_478102" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-25T15:13:10+00:00" title="November 25, 2018  3:13PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I guess the point I was making up there was that I'm an example of a person for whom disassociation is not an issue, and the reason for that might be that I don't conceptualize gaming from an immersive viewpoint.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nOkay, thanks for clarification. Completely reasonable. I asked because a number of people here are making drive-by claims that the concept is useless, which can only be true if it does not help people in general to clarify their thinking.\n<blockquote><br/>These types of examples of how different people might construe gaming, and therefore mechanical disassociation, might then help explain why disassociation matters or doesn't matter. Specifically, I wonder if disassociation is a fundamental issue: can you make a non-working game into a working one by reducing disassociation while retaining what the rule actually does? What kinds of games are the ones where this might be the case?<br/></blockquote>\nLet us say I want to use a game with lots of dissociated mechanics for sandbox play; that is, I want the world to exist and be consistent irrespective of what the player characters are doing or who the player characters are. Suppose I have some motivation and a creative agenda consistent with this. (I trust in your ability to come up with examples of creative goals this would serve.)<br/><br/>I would want to come up with some standards for how to represent various fictional things with the dissociated rules. Which D&amp;D 4 monsters are minions and which normal monsters, for example, or whether smelling the fumes of the jade mushrooms gives an aspect or causes stress in Fate. This would make the game world more solid and real, which presumably is a goal in this type of play.<br/><br/>Associating the rules would create good heuristics for choosing the representations. Thus, it would reduce the mental load on the game master and increase the predictability of the world for everyone.\n<blockquote><br/>Regarding old school wargamey D&amp;D, I don't think that it's more than moderately associated mechanically, but if somebody feels differently, then who am I to naysay their experience. I think that getting a keep on name level is storygamey as fuck, but that's just me.<br/></blockquote>\nSuppose, as a player, you hear there is a giant rampaging the countryside and it is as tall as the trees. Presumably you have some idea of how hard it would be to face in combat and otherwise; you might assume it moves faster than you because it is big and can take long strides, it probably has lots of hit points because you doubt it would be easy to kill it by martial means. Attacks by it probably cause lots of damage, so it will probably one-shot weak characters and even strong characters might not be able to endure for a long time. All of this plays into the plans you do to defeat it. None of this would be possible if the mechanics were severely dissociated.<br/><br/>As a referee, you have taken a nice system-neutral one page dungeon and inserted it to the map. The players got lost in their way and wander there. From the adventure you figure out that the cyaxes living there are intelligent beetles the size of bears, and they can manipulate electromagnetic fields, even inside people. They hunt like that and communicate like that. How do you give stats to them unless the mechanics are reasonably associated?\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/hyades" rel="nofollow">hyades</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> </p><blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" rel="nofollow">Thanuir</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>I have neither read nor played Swords without master, so please elaborate or use another game as an example.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nSure. You roll two dice corresponding to the two tones "jovial" and "glum." Wichever comes up higher dictates the tone for either the scene or a character's actions depending on who rolled. <br/><br/>My thought was that this might appear dissociated to someone who's looking for fiction that is "predictable" in a way that serves their agenda of problem solving. <br/><br/>For me, though, who doesn't care about problem-solving but does care about an authentic and convincing fiction it is very much associated.<br/></div></blockquote>\nThanks for the description. Supposing the tones are the result of a coin flip (this seems to not be the case, but for simplicity), and the rule seems like one that would be easy to associate (characters just seem to have good and bad days, which affect how they view the world and how the world responds to them, just like good and bad stuff in Amber diceless). More complicated associations would also be possible. If it interacts in a more involved way with other resolution mechanics, then I can not say.<br/><br/>So: Fairly easy to associate, but dissociated as is. Since the game is, as far as I understand, not one of problem solving or careful analysis of the local metaphysics, associating the rule might very well not be worth the cost, which would come from questions like should the tone be jovial in relaxed situations and so forth.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Rickard" rel="nofollow">Rickard</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>It seems to me that the author is used to switching between these states of mind \u2013 making choice based on mechanics or character \u2013 and doesn't seem to notice the switches.

I've introduced people to rpgs with BW, TB or some PbtA games, and in general they don't have any issues with their "disassociated" rules, which for me at least points towards traditional games crystalizing some notions in their minds about how games should be.<br/><br/>I think this concept fails when you try to apply it to new players with none of the baggage most of us have. In fact, some new players will naturally try to step into the role of GMs at times and declare stuff about the world, proving that hardcore player-character identification is not a universal need for most roleplayers nor something every designer should have as a priority.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478107/#Comment_478107" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-25T16:14:35+00:00" title="November 25, 2018  4:14PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 25, 2018 5:43PM by DeReel.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">@Thanuir</a> "But this is getting awfully abstract and handwavy.

This is all in your head. No disrespect : the understanding takes place in your head. You cling to this idea that "it's in the rule", but really, it doesn't do anything for you. How could it be in the rule when you can change the "ass/diss status" without changing the rule ? OK, I understand that "associated rule" is a short hand for "a rule that someone can use and understands without entering the dissociated psychological state", but don't make it a "thing" (positivist phlogistic fallacy strikes again).<br/><br/>"it is an important concept for many." ?! wake up your brain we need you here ?! are you selling a belief or making a concept ?<br/><br/>I like your Karma and token story as it reminds me of the main narrative device in Hunter x Hunter (focusing on the exact wording of powers). But to be exact, the fictional elements are Karma, good event, bad event. Tokens are a real world prop, a representation. When you get a token, your character maybe has the feeling that some day some good event will "repay" the present bad event, or maybe it is so and they don't know. <br/><br/>If the character knows for certain Karma exists, "Let's dig for karma then" is the exact conclusion. And guess what : people <span style="text-decoration: underline;">actually</span> do the strangest things according to the strangest believes they hold. Historical evidences abound : picture the monasteries as Karma factories, and natural disasters and wars as Karma bonanzas. The poor, the disabled ? Karma springs. No kidding, it's LIVE now.<br/><br/>For me Karma exists in the fiction, but maybe the character doesn't know it. In the definition, the character is out of the picture. The character doesn't understand anything. It doesn't even exist in the first place. The problem is that you seem to insist that the character knows for certain all the rules of their world for them to be associated. But that's just you insisting on something that's not theoretically possible (because of some math study), certainly not desirable, less necessary, and -mind you- not even realistic. Maybe you prepare this caricature for a later counter-argument, I don't know, due to ghost discussions or something, but this is really problematic. Because bad faith would be the best case.<br/><br/>The worst case would be that you are really deluded about the real world. I already mentioned the fact that the body of scientific knowledge in the real world is ad hoc most of the time, it is also, by definition, always temporarily true, that is, false for the most part <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> . And, as I said, I like it like that. We humans don't know the rules of this world. It may be the case that we have theoretically no access whatsoever to truth. Some optimists like me add "except by chance, unknowingly". But this is me reveling in metaphysics on the side. The point is this : "In the definition you provided, the character is out of the picture. Of course. The character doesn't understand anything. It doesn't even exist.

However, in my experience, it falls apart immediately in practice if two players who aren't coming from a VERY similar background and aesthetic try to apply it. <br/><br/>I've yet to see any "definition" which could be reliably applied in the same way by two different people.<br/><br/>(As can be seen by some people defending D&amp;D by comparing it to other games with more "dissociated" mechanics, whereas others feel the need to redesign the same game from scratch because the rules are too dissociated -<br/></div></blockquote>\nDifferences are to be expected, because people have different experiences in the world and see different things as true. Furthermore, for some rules it is non-trivial to come up with good associations, and not everyone has done it or encountered those.<br/><br/>However, nobody is talking about how the strength score in D&amp;D is dissociated (as far as I know). The hit point discussion is very frequent. Then someone tells that you only get hurt when you run out, and many people are happy.<br/><br/>With Burning wheel, having discussions about resources is common (or at least used to be on the forum). Very few people have similar questions about steel, even though it and the limited list of responses were fairly novel back then. Why do people talk about resources but not steel?<br/><br/>My answer to both of these would be that strength score and steel attribute are associated - they have obvious fictional interpretation - while hit points and resources behave in a less intuitive manner, so they require more work to associate and people do not simply instantly do it. I would be interested in your explanation of the phenomenon.\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" rel="nofollow">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Why can't I try to parry an attack?

If you are used to something, you either have associated it in a way that makes sense, or you have learned to not try to associate it at all. Maybe you are playing in a way that does not require association, or maybe that particular rule being dissociated does not have that big an effect for you.<br/><br/>However: The more associated a rule is, the less necessary it is for you to do the work of associating or ignoring the thing, if those matter to you. I would also argue that more associated rules are, other things being equal, easier to understand and learn, since you can draw connections to things you already know.<br/><br/>The second response is: If associated rules did not matter, why would people bother to design games that fix those very issues the concept points out? Why would they be discussed so often (as mentioned above)?\n<blockquote><br/>* You're playing a game and try to make choices from your character's perspective... when you realize that you must modify these choices because of the way the rules work.<br/><br/>If you are able to rationalize these changes in your behaviour in a way which allows you to maintain the illusion of verisimilitude, everything is fine.<br/><br/>If you are unable to do so, you are suddenly torn between doing the thing which seems natural and organic and "right" and following the rules accurately.<br/><br/>That's when something feels "dissociated".<br/><br/>For my tastes, this comes up ALL THE TIME in D&amp;D, so I find it hilarious when D&amp;D players are offended about "dissociated mechanics", but for some people the assumptions of D&amp;D play are so deeply ingrained that it doesn't seem to bother them.<br/></blockquote>\nI agree this is one possible outcome of meeting dissociated rules, or just rules that are a bad simulation of fictional reality that one would like to have. Maybe the D&amp;D players are offended because they have to do more work to absorb new rules that are dissociated?<br/><br/>I agree that one good way of dealing with this is to move to rules sets that do not simulate the fictional reality as rigidly. I believe this is a question of abstraction more the dissociation, or of sense of realism.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DeReel" rel="nofollow">DeReel</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>At last we are talking of dissociation as a psychological state.

It does rely on people having somewhat similar understandings of reality, but only to the extent that all roleplaying does - diegesis or shared imagined space or whatever you want to call the fiction relies on constant discussion and clarification, but it is quite possible to operate with it. Any property relating to the fiction must, of necessity, have similar kind of uncertainty around it.\n<blockquote><br/>One thing with the concept is that it cleaves through all my functional concepts : I can see many solutions to the problems it helps to solve, but I think it bundles so many things it is not practical. <br/>For instance : sometimes you will have to correct the abstraction level for realism, clean the murk with a map, sometimes you will have a discussion with the symptom player about their expectations about the game, etc.<br/>The very fact that players evoke the sciences of the fictive world is typical of an interest in the simulation. Like in Archipelago, if the Ocean player states there is a certain species of fish used for navigation, the fact is established for future,  past and present  It's a "mini game" I propose in my game for the Thinker players. But it has little to do with what I consider the rules, actually. It is rather a mode of play, something that the rules allow. I never had to use a funny word to explain this. Except maybe "establish" ?</blockquote>\nIf I understand you correctly, I agree that you present solutions to some problems, but I do not understand how this relates to the discussion at hand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478121/#Comment_478121" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-25T22:01:05+00:00" title="November 25, 2018 10:01PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanuir,<br/><br/>The issue of "dissociated moments" coming up with Strength scores was actually a pretty common one for me and my group(s) back when we played a lot of D&amp;D. It's also a common "problem point" among people who are serious about designing "physics sim" rules.<br/><br/>A typical D&amp;D moment is the one where the Strength 18 Goliath Barbarian attempts to lift the giant rock, the GM asks for a Strength check, and he fails. Then the other players want to try, as well, and the Hobbit with a Strength of 8 manages the roll.<br/><br/>This kind of outcome is very hard to "associate", and would be far easier using more abstract conflict resolution mechanics.<br/><br/>And that's basically my issue with this whole topic:<br/><br/>It suggests that "association" and "dissociation" are properties of rules, whereas I often see the opposite results in actual play. A highly "associated" property (like a Strength check) has to be handled very carefully to avoid creating moments of "dissociation" in a way that more "dissociated", highly abstract mechanics handle without a hitch.<br/><br/>There is so much subjectivity and personal taste mixed into the whole thing that treating it like an obvious and logical description of a phenomenon is very misleading, in my opinion. <br/><br/>For instance, would purely freeform roleplay be considered more "associated" or less "associated"? It's not an easy question to answer, and I doubt many people would answer the same way. <br/><br/>By the same token, some players say that freeform-with-a-GM is incredibly immersion-facilitating, while others say it is entirely anathema to their immersion.<br/><br/>In my experience, looking at roleplaying through the lens of relatively antiquated terminology like "immersion" and "dissociated mechanics" is more likely to get us into trouble, posturing, and arguing than to communicate anything meaningful. It reminds me of the whole "rollplaying vs. roleplaying" debates and seem about equally useful.<br/><br/>Consider for a moment that most of the arguments and points brought up in favour of the utility of such concepts apply in exactly the same way to "rollplaying vs. roleplaying"; they are strong terms which "immediately make sense" to many people hearing them, and are at least vaguely related to some real phenomena. However, in practice, it is practically impossible to reach consensus, and so they invariably lead to personal arguments based on taste, familiarity, and sensibility.<br/><br/>It feels funny to be having this discussion in 2018, in other words. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>That's my take on all of this, really. I don't have much to add.<br/><br/><br/>(Except, perhaps, that Vincent Baker's "Clouds and Boxes" diagrams do a nice job of digging deeper into the actual structure of rules and how they operate with the participants of play, without delving into the morass of ancient online debates. If anyone is reading this and hasn't seen those essays, I recommend checking them out for an alternate point of view.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478124/#Comment_478124" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-25T22:30:38+00:00" title="November 25, 2018 10:30PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Rickard" rel="nofollow">Rickard</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> </p><blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DeReel" rel="nofollow">DeReel</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Isn't it clearly absurd to say that creating your character is not about roleplaying your character ?</p></div></blockquote>\nI would say no.

I don't usually need to explain how and why every mechanic exists. Some few players try to understand what's the purpose of a rule, but they're a few.

No kidding, it's LIVE now.<br/></blockquote>\nYes, this type of karma is one interpretation. Yes, as often, associating rules creates interesting play, but that specific type of interest might not be the point of any given game.<br/><br/>I am not insisting that a character knows all the rules. I am stating that a character who starts figuring out the rules is a viable one, and if the rules are associated and metaphysically interesting, also something that such interesting metaphysics encourage (by being interesting). For example.<br/><br/>In particular, an associated rule can be one that does not directly affect any character at all.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/hyades" rel="nofollow">hyades</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>I disagree.

Then the other players want to try, as well, and the Hobbit with a Strength of 8 manages the roll.<br/><br/>This kind of outcome is very hard to "associate", and would be far easier using more abstract conflict resolution mechanics.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nRight. I'll try to explain my take on the matter. I would appreciate if you confirmed you understand the difference I am trying to make clear (even if you choose to disagree).<br/><br/>A given rule can:<br/>1. Have a clear interpretation in the fiction and conform to one's intuitions about whatever it is trying to represent. It might be realistic or suitable to the genre the game is trying to replicate or something like that.<br/>2. Have a clear interpretation in the fiction, but break one's intuitions about whatever it is trying to represent. One might call it unrealistic or a poor fit for the genre or whatever.<br/>3. Not have a clear (and unique) interpretation in the fiction.<br/><br/>I would call both 1 and 2 instances of an associated rule. Number three would be dissociated. I think the strength example is 2 - you and everyone I have ever talked to has a good idea of what it means to be strong in D&amp;D (if they know about D&amp;D and ability scores) - you can carry lots of stuff, hit hard, and can accomplish feats of strength.<br/><br/>Do you see the difference between options 2 and 3?<br/><br/>Incidentally, I do agree that abstract conflict resolution mechanics are a good way of creating realistic play (or play conforming to other genre assumptions), much like rulings are. They both allow changing the level of abstraction, whereas straightforward "rules as physics of the game world" or rules as written approach typically lead to inconsistencies when edge cases or wrong scale of abstraction are met.\n<blockquote><br/>For instance, would purely freeform roleplay be considered more "associated" or less "associated"? <br/></blockquote>\nSince "purely freeform" can include many of things, it is pretty hard to discuss.<br/><br/>I would say that the traditional GM and player roles are quite associated - one's own character has a clear fictional interpretation, as does the rest of the fiction.<br/><br/>Something like Primetime adventures offers a nice case study, I think. Working off of memory (it has been years since I read the game and I have not played it), it seems overall fairly associated in that the television series interpretation ties together stuff pretty well. If one imagines a game that has precisely the same formal rules with different names and with no explicit tv interpretation, it would be a lot more dissociated. Understanding why you draw a variable number of cards in each scene (or session? whichever) and why you can give bonus tokens to others and so on would be more difficult, I conjecture.\n<blockquote><br/>By the same token, some players say that freeform-with-a-GM is incredibly immersion-facilitating, while others say it is entirely anathema to their immersion.<br/><br/>In my experience, looking at roleplaying through the lens of relatively antiquated terminology like "immersion" and "dissociated mechanics" is more likely to get us into trouble, posturing, and arguing than to communicate anything meaningful. It reminds me of the whole "rollplaying vs. roleplaying" debates and seem about equally useful.<br/></blockquote>\n*Antiquated*, here, is a pretty strong term. You should fight that fight with someone more vested in immersion. I see the term in use and do understand a bit about how people play when they describe their play of a traditional game as such.<br/><br/>Roll- vs roleplay is almost dead and good riddance.\n<blockquote><br/>It feels funny to be having this discussion in 2018, in other words. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/></blockquote>\nI feel like talking GNS theory on rpg.net: There are people having emotional reactions to the terms and attacking their pop meanings, and there are people criticizing old essays even when I am trying to formalize something new.<br/><br/>Thank you for the response; I think it is useful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478161/#Comment_478161" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-26T21:11:28+00:00" title="November 26, 2018  9:11PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Rickard" rel="nofollow">Rickard</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> </p><blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" rel="nofollow">EmmatheExcrucian</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I don't make choices based on my character's perspective when I play roleplaying games.

Well for me anyway.<br/><br/>There is a certain aesthetic approach to the fiction that some people innately take and others don\u2019t. I think immersion, disassociated mechanics and most importantly, the theory of stance, all point towards it. <br/><br/>Apologies for jargon:  The Big Model theory of stance is rubbish. If the old threefold stance model had been retained, expanded upon,  then we\u2019d have an easier time explaining the approach. What me and my ilk prioritise is \u2018important stuff happening in actor stance.\u2019 Which is pretty much the conclusion the Alexandrian comes to, with the extra barb thrown in that other stuff isn\u2019t \u2018real role-playing.\u2019<br/><br/>From this viewpoint it\u2019s not that disassociated mechanics are always bad, evil and wrong.

You'll say a few words about beliefs (how they are player priorities and character goals), or a lot more if they are not pregenerated. Maybe you'll need to explain steel, or maybe the meaning is obvious in your language. Instincts are if-then statements. So on.<br/><br/>My conjecture is that artha requires more work to explain than other things, due to the dissociation - it is not enough to refer to a real word concept.<br/>Also, in play, resources will require a few more words, because people are used to thinking about giving money and receiving an item or service, rather than an economy of gifts, debts and trust. So you'll be asked explain when someone fails a roll. This is at least my experience when teaching the game.<br/><br/>I would guess the same is true of Torchbearer - many of the numbers are easy to explain ("nature" is how dwarfy or elfy you are are, conditions explain themselves reasonably, and so on) while the checks and usage thereof is a new concept without obvious interpretation, so you will have to explain it.<br/><br/>Again, I would be particularly interested in specific counterexamples, where someone has very hard time understanding what "reflexes" could mean, but immediately understands what artha is with little explanation.

She would have to study the rules for a really long time to keep track of them, and had a lot of trouble remembering them in play. She always had to ask for a lot of help, but it was the sort of situation where we couldn't reasonably be upset about it, because she was clearly trying her best. She just couldn't parse how mechanics directly mapping character abilities and stuff functioned, because it wasn't anything at all like how she was used to thinking about roleplay and stories and stuff. Her natural approach was a combination of Author and Director Stances, and the whole concept of Actor Stance was foreign and confusing to her.<br/>Then when we started playing Chuubo's, the moment she saw all the very "disassociated" stuff (especially the stuff for planning and scripting character arcs from a deeply authorial perspective), she was like a fish in water, because it was the sort of stuff she was paradigmatically used to from her experience of roleplay and her experience of the way she looks at stories (which is very deeply rooted in in-depth literary analysis-type stuff).<br/>So ye. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478186/#Comment_478186" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-27T15:01:31+00:00" title="November 27, 2018  3:01PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" rel="nofollow">Thanuir</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>I would guess the same is true of Torchbearer - many of the numbers are easy to explain ("nature" is how dwarfy or elfy you are are, conditions explain themselves reasonably, and so on) while the checks and usage thereof is a new concept without obvious interpretation, so you will have to explain it.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nI teach Torchbearer a lot and I think this is either very clear or very strange depending on how it's introduced.<br/><br/>It usually goes well if you say: this is a game about played flawed characters acting under pressure.  If you find ways to incorporate the flaws of your character into a test, describing how your character traits make something riskier for you, then you earn a valuable reward called a check.  A check lets you take special actions in camp (like recovery and mapping) that you would otherwise have to do in town.  This is a cost/benefit analysis you'll make as a player, and it might get your character into trouble in interesting ways.<br/><br/>It goes poorly if you say: you can't camp without a check, and you earns checks by using a trait against yourself.  The you explain those three terms and people ask what your roleplay has to do with their character camping.<br/><br/>In the first instance, most players have seen that checks allow them to make a troubled/ flawed character without undermining the cooperative effort of the party.  Without this incentive to highlight the inconvenient side of your character traits, the game would encourage you to make totally bland and effective characters because the party is trying to succeed and survive.  In the second instance, you end up in conversations about something like 'association' that can derail the flow of the session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478191/#Comment_478191" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-27T18:05:15+00:00" title="November 27, 2018  6:05PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 27, 2018 6:05PM by JDCorley.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hit points are a fully associated mechanic because they collate a number of factors into a single abstraction: how close you are to not being able to defend yourself in a fight.

Both of them actually being associated mechanics makes sense in that regard.<br/><br/>So what about scene framing, associated or not? I'm going to guess that GM scene framing is usually associated, and implicitly understood as a simple pacing conceit - it's not that reality itself cuts in and out like a movie, but rather we just don't bother to play through every second. (In other words, framing does not "actually happen" in the game fiction, and it does nothing of importance to the fictional world, so it simply can't be disassociated any more than my grabbing a drink during the game is.) When players get to "order" scenes, such as in <i>Primetime Adventures</i>, that choice is associated because the player is simply describing "what my character does next", which is a highly associated activity. Neither form of scene framing requires any player to make disassociated choices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478197/#Comment_478197" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-27T19:04:34+00:00" title="November 27, 2018  7:04PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" rel="nofollow">EmmatheExcrucian</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>There's a player in my group who back when we played trad and neotrad games (basically, back when we played games with primarily "associated" mechanics), she had a lot of trouble grasping the game.

The idea that characters are described by numbers and words in a formal way. (Like strength 4, trait: obsessive, ...)<br/>3. Implementing the mechanics: Picking the number, rolling dice, maybe arithmetic or counting, announcing the result.<br/>4. Interpreting the result back into the fiction.<br/>5. That the mechanical rules make decisions about outcomes of actions.<br/>6. Related to the following: That one does not have full control of what happens to one's character.<br/>(I'm probably missing something; these are just what came to mind at the moment.)\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/moconnor" rel="nofollow">moconnor</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>I teach Torchbearer a lot and I think this is either very clear or very strange depending on how it's introduced.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nInteresting observation.

I have years of experience in other fields of roleplay (other than RPGs) and I have to tell you that a lot of our assumptions that we are used to are not natural to most of players.<br/><br/>My data is not representative but I have found that a lot of people feel that jumping in and out of a role is more easier and more fun than staying in one for hours. Also, that using shallow roles and changing them between scenes is more valuable than immersing ourselves deeply in a fully rounded character.<br/><br/>I dont want to take sides but a lot of times hardcore RPG fans think that  they know what roleplay means, what roleplay is. Like RPG = roleplay. Which is definitely not true. Its a very special, very narrow kind of rp IMHO.<br/><br/>Actually a definition of 'role-play' from one of the founding fathers of Drama in Education is (paraphrasing) 'any activity in which at least one participant enacts a role'. That is a quite open ended definition, even too much, right?<br/><br/>Contrast it with one of the direction of this thread ('Looks like a great part of doing RPGs is not actual roleplaying due to the high ratio of dissociated tasks') is in the other extreme.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>To reconcile these tensioms I have a proposal. Are you familiar with Nathan Hook's <a href="https://www.google.hu/amp/s/nordiclarp.org/2015/05/13/the-d-m-creative-agenda-model-an-axis-instead-of-a-pyramid/amp/" rel="nofollow">D-M Creative Agenda Model</a>?

The concept of associated mechanics is useful at least for the following people:<br/><br/>A. People who want their game to be about players engaging in solving fictional problems by fictional means and thinking. Dissociated mechanics retract from this by making the fiction less predictable and by offering non-diegetic tools and restrictions to the problem solving.<br/><br/>B. People who use a game whose rules affect the fiction, and who want to have vivid and non-jarring mental images of what happens in play. With associated rules, everything discussed in terms of rules is also, at the same time, discussed in terms of fiction.<br/><br/>Obviously: If one is using entirely formal rules about scene framing and right to narrate, then this is not a concern, as the rules have very little chance of contradicting the mental images.<br/><br/>C. Character immersion with heavy rules. My info is second hand, here, so I would prefer to not speculate about these people. I would be interested in hearing from any of them.</p></div></blockquote>Agreed 100%.  Although it looks like the term "dissociated mechanics" is such a flame-trigger that we need a different label.<br/><br/>Here's a thought about a mechanics taxonomy:<br/>- <b>Fiction-descriptive</b> - serves only to measure established fiction in numbers (example: once "50/50 shot" is established in fiction, that becomes "roll 11+ on a d20")<br/>- <b>Fiction-additive</b> - introduces new content (events, objects, probabilities) into the fiction (example: "every hour of actual play, roll for wandering monsters")<br/>- <b>Fiction-prescriptive</b> - establishes what can and cannot happen fictionally at a given time (examples: Combat rounds!  Hit points!  (If you can make these purely fiction-descriptive in your game, you are a mental ninja master!  Mostly that honestly does not happen.))<br/>- <b>Fiction-independent</b> - changes the player's position without "going through" the fiction; fiction may be adjusted afterward if desired (example: I spend a token to cost you your turn; maybe I then narrate how my character's minions' attacks are depleting your character's resources, and you complete the narration by describing your character's distraction)<br/><br/>I have a feeling this taxonomy won't hold up, but maybe it's a stab in a useful direction?<br/><br/>Regarding taste and immersion, some players can integrate <i>any</i> sort of mechanic into the fiction, processing "I spend to skip your turn" as "my minions attack your resources", as if the minion action were the ultimate cause, with the distracted opponent the ultimate effect, and the game's token rules a mere way of tracking and reminding participants that that's how the world works.<br/><br/>But, y'know, that's not trivially easy, and not everyone can do it, so I don't blame the folks who'd rather not try.  It's both a taste issue and a challenge.<br/><br/>Fiction-based problem-solving, on the other hand, is <i>literally impossible</i> if the mechanics dictate how problems can be solved.  The only matter of taste there is the desire to play a fiction-based problem-solving game in the first place.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" rel="nofollow">Thanuir</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>A given rule can:<br/>1.

So it's hard to say <i>definitively</i> whether a rule <i>is</i> fiction-independent.  Perhaps the closest we can get is to say that it doesn't <i>require</i> the fiction.  It is in fact <i>possible</i> to spend a token and lose a turn without fiction involved.<br/><br/>I feel like there are a <i>ton</i> of RPG mechanics which <i>can</i> be used without fiction, but it's counter-intuitive to do so.  So, for me, a fiction-independent mechanic is the kind where you might expect to have to remind a player to contribute fiction, because contributing fiction is not intuitive.<br/><br/>One example is Trust in Mountain Witch.  You can award or withhold your tokens purely as a player, based on which players you want to give leverage to, based on their mechanical positioning, seating position, etc.  I think this is a fairly intuitive way to play.  After making such choices, some players will then say, "My character is beginning to trust your character because of that last scene," and others won't.<br/><br/>A counter-example is any game with traits that you can rope into a dice pool when your group doesn't force you to narrate how they apply.  What starts as a character attempt to achieve a fictional objective can turn into a player attempt to beat a target number.  I remember a Burning Wheel player roping in "tail-wise" from his rat character, a trait that described a physical rat tail, to try to stealthily follow someone ("tail" them, huh huh) -- this player action was dependent on <i>not</i> going through the fiction.  He just threw a die in the pool while quickly shouting out a trait name and hoping we wouldn't process it.  So apparently this is a thing that can happen.  I do <i>not</i> think it's intuitive, though.<br/><br/>Is that a coherent enough distinction?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478255/#Comment_478255" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-28T20:46:48+00:00" title="November 28, 2018  8:46PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 28, 2018 9:04PM by DeReel.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This tail you told is linked to the fiction, with a detour by narration.

There is a small group who immediately grasp the "RPG as virtual reality" metaphor and are capable and interested in playing everything from "actor stance" (that is, through the eyes of their character), but most people have quite a different approach to roleplaying games. <br/><br/>There are people who focus in on the "game" aspect strongly, and they are quite interested in rules and mechanics, and certainly don't worry about how "associated" something is, but just look to master the rules and get fun outcomes from them. There are also people who see "the larger story" as the point of play, and have trouble doing anything but engaging with that directly (often, being constrained to a single character is confusing or even nearly impossible to remember!). There are others who latch onto the "acting out a role" part, mostly interested in the presentation and interpretation of the character, like an actor. They might seek cues for "how to play correctly", and thereby find directive rules really useful (e.g. XP rewards), or might focus so strongly on the activity of roleplaying/acting out that mechanics and rules, in general, are distracting and confusing.<br/><br/>And then there are all the people who combine some various aspects of all these perspectives, or can learn to.<br/><br/>In this sense, I agree with Emma's experience - it's something I've seen quite a lot:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" rel="nofollow">EmmatheExcrucian</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>There's a player in my group who back when we played trad and neotrad games (basically, back when we played games with primarily "associated" mechanics), she had a lot of trouble grasping the game. She would have to study the rules for a really long time to keep track of them, and had a lot of trouble remembering them in play. She always had to ask for a lot of help, but it was the sort of situation where we couldn't reasonably be upset about it, because she was clearly trying her best. She just couldn't parse how mechanics directly mapping character abilities and stuff functioned, because it wasn't anything at all like how she was used to thinking about roleplay and stories and stuff. Her natural approach was a combination of Author and Director Stances, and the whole concept of Actor Stance was foreign and confusing to her.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nA friend of mine used a nice phrase once:<br/><br/><b><i>"Operating within a stance"</i></b><br/><br/>I liked that quite a bit. One of the challenges that some roleplaying games (but not all) pose is that they are best played from a specific stance or perspective, and so the player must learn to discipline themselves to "operate within that stance". Some people find this intuitive; others find it almost impossible.<br/><br/>I sometimes feel that the culture of roleplaying which plays a very specific subset of traditional games in a very particular way (and, it seems to me, they overlap heavily with the people who find discussion of "dissociated mechanics" highly relevant to their play experience) is a subset of all gamers/roleplayers who are used to and expect a very particular kind of engagement with the game. There's nothing wrong with that (and I find it a really fun way to play!), but mistaking it for the entire field, which people sometimes do, can get people into hot water - and into debates or arguments.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478267/#Comment_478267" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-29T07:22:57+00:00" title="November 29, 2018  7:22AM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 29, 2018 7:27AM by DeReel.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think we should try again this study in another thread, without reference to the Alexandrian and without specialised terms, without expressing judgement other than preferences.

I'm going to guess that GM scene framing is usually associated, and implicitly understood as a simple pacing conceit - it's not that reality itself cuts in and out like a movie, but rather we just don't bother to play through every second. (In other words, framing does not "actually happen" in the game fiction, and it does nothing of importance to the fictional world, so it simply can't be disassociated any more than my grabbing a drink during the game is.) When players get to "order" scenes, such as in <i>Primetime Adventures</i>, that choice is associated because the player is simply describing "what my character does next", which is a highly associated activity. Neither form of scene framing requires any player to make disassociated choices.</p></div></blockquote>\nIn Primetime adventures, if we accept the tv show premise, then I would say that framing scenes is very associated. Is this the way it is explained in the game?<br/>Otherwise, it becomes a question of whether the choice as to which scene to frame can be made based on fictional grounds.<br/><br/>I agree that the act of scene framing is not interesting to analyze by itself, precisely because it is so disjointed from the fiction.<br/><br/>This seems to be a general trend; if a concept is too far from the fiction, then analyzing it from association point of view does not seem useful.<br/><br/>Analyzing the criteria by which the next scene is chosen seems to be more reasonable. Typical traditional techniques focus on uncertainty, danger, or potential to reveal something about the characters. Typical drama game techniques, traditional or not, relate to character motivations, significant decision points and potential to reveal something about the characters. Seeing if these and others can be associated seems to be a worthwhile thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P

When you play Fate, you know fiction is going to happen in a world where Karma exists. It's written on the tin, engraved in the rules. It's not really metaphysics anymore, it's physics in Fate. <br/><br/>I don't know if with "metaphysics" you're really saying "this rule can be associated as long as it doesn't get used", in which case I'll reach certainty that I don't understand anything you say.<br/><br/>I sometimes think you're saying : rules for Fate providing a clear, univocal explanation of what Fate points mean, exactly, are "associated". Is this a question of rules redaction / presentation, then ? If this is so, then I'll object that a pragmatical approach (bread is a thing you eat, cut it like that, store it like so) is regularly better than an accurate explanation (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread</a>) for rules redaction. <br/><br/>Rules redaction, psychological state, actual procedures of play linking intra and extra-diegetic material : it's crowded in here. And the topics are not small.<br/><br/>The main problem is not one of preferences. We can distinguish what we like and what is good with few clarifications. The large size of messages and all the rhetoric, if not methodological precautions in the thread comes from somewhere else.<br/><br/>The main problem is that you are using the handle of an epic Narr slaying sword, removing the blade, and saying : we can use this concept. Well, as OP shows in points 5 and 6, this concept (the handle) is so linked to judgement (the blade) that it's going to be hard to do anything else with it. Even brandishing the pummel or saying the sword's name is enough for flaming a war. It's a sort of Godwin point. Why insist ?

Many have engaged in the hypothetical exercise where a fictional or metaphysical explanation of fate points would make FATE work for an alienated player. An explanation in the requested terms was provided, but there's a "trade-off", apparently. But it seems to be a given that most players will accept the highly convoluted associative-explanations for hit points, turns, initiative, vancian magic, etc (in my experience, players simply don't care, though).<br/>What I'm beginning to think is that either, by following this definition, all games are dissociated, or we should reject it and try to frame a more useful concept.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478284/#Comment_478284" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-29T17:48:08+00:00" title="November 29, 2018  5:48PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 29, 2018 7:21PM by DeReel.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JDCorley also holds that all rules are dissociated by nature. But I say no-no, it's not as ambitious as "a game is dissociated". It is more or less so. Like in some games, some players can easily picture things simulated by the rules. And in other games, some rules are just harder to represent with things in the fiction by some players.<br/><br/>Look, it's simple : one rule is, at a certain time, associated or not, for a certain person, according to the presentation of the rule the person has been exposed to. The fact is, when you read Fate rulebook, the authors probably don't try to give an "in fiction" rationale for Fate points. The rule is therefore dissociated.* <br/>* except it is "intuitively" associated by some players either well versed in fiction analysis, metaphysics, role playing or that simply have a potent solvent for imagination.**<br/>** which begs the question of whether that explanation or intuition must be shared among all players ? or only within expert community ? A schism could ensue <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>But if you (come out from under the sofa and) explain to the player that fate points are to the character like the god of destiny's invisible magic wand bullets, then the rule is associated. This is not a good or a bad thing per se. It's just fact, by definition. And that's mostly it. <br/><br/>Am I correct <a href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">@Thanuir</a> ?

And in other games, some rules are just harder to represent with things in the fiction by some players.<br/><br/>Look, it's simple : one rule is, at a certain time, associated or not, for a certain person, according to the presentation of the rule the person has been exposed to. The fact is, when you read Fate rulebook, the authors probably don't try to give an "in fiction" rationale for Fate points. The rule is therefore dissociated.* <br/>* except it is "intuitively" associated by some players either well versed in fiction analysis, metaphysics, role playing or that simply have a potent solvent for imagination.**<br/>** which begs the question of whether that explanation or intuition must be shared among all players ? or only within expert community ?

Vancian Magic doesn't bother a lot of people, because it's easy enough to say "Okay, Wizard Magic has rules, and those rules are kinda screwy and weird, but it's Wizard Magic, so it's kinda supposed to be weird and screwy."  But there's no embedded explanation of Fate Points at all (obstacle 1) and even if you presented one, it ends up as "That's just how the universe is!" and some people will balk, probably in part because there isn't one Fate Universe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Khimus" title="Khimus"><img alt="Khimus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Khimus">Khimus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478287/#Comment_478287" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-29T19:59:07+00:00" title="November 29, 2018  7:59PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So it's about whether the player can accept or incorporate an explanation, even if it doesn't make a lot of sense.

I\u2019m not saying that the terms couldn\u2019t be useful, but they have been defined in a rather slippery way without much caveat. Also, the topics the terms are being used to address have already be discussed thoroughly and in more sophisticated and constructive ways. <br/><br/>Different RPGs have different design and gameplay goals. To say that the more associated mechanics a RPG has, the better it is, is just making a statement of personal preference. Anyone thinking in such stark and simple terms is putting fairly arbitrary design and gameplay constraints on a RPG for what essentially amounts to an ideological stance. <br/><br/>As an aside, the claim made in the attached link, which is that <i>real</i> RPGs are the ones that use associated mechanics, is mindless and tribalistic nonsense, and we\u2019ve  had enough of this sort of talk in the hobby. I know this view doesn\u2019t represent the OP\u2019s perspective, but I do think it has relevance with regard to the larger subject. If these terms are being used to argue for the superiority of a  particular type of RPG over another, than they are probably going to be construed as divisive by many.<br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478306/#Comment_478306" name="Item_113" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-30T06:46:50+00:00" title="November 30, 2018  6:46AM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is an interesting discussion! Many kudos to <a href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">@Thanuir</a> for keeping a cool head. I'm one of those who find the concept intuitively easy to grasp, even though I don't think that way in my own gaming. In fact, I think I have a tendency to dissociate rules that are supposed to be associated.<br/><br/>For me, the rules are not, and have never been, things that exist in the game world. That is, just because a PC has an easier time lifting a rock if they have a high Strength score doesn't mean that people in this world have Strength scores that measure how good they are at lifting rocks, or that having a high Strength score means you are strong. To me, the Strength score is used to determine what happens in the fiction as we play. All it means is that this character will often be successful at lifting rocks, at least when we are looking. People in the world in general are weak or strong, but this has nothing to do with the rules of the game. It doesn't even mean anything about how good the character is at lifting rocks when we aren't looking (off screen). If there's a lot of rock-lifting that happens off screen and we mention it in the game, it makes sense to make up that this character did pretty well, for the sake of consistency of the fiction. But this has nothing to do with the Strength score per se.<br/><br/>An example: I played a Battlebabe in an Apocalypse World campaign. She was the baddest and inyourfaciest gosh darn person in the world. She was a killing machine, and probably accounted for half the deaths in the story, and she was always cocky and menacing. She also had -2 Hard. To me, her low Hard score didn't mean she wasn't "hard". If there was ever anyone who could reasonably be called hard, she was it. However, when we were looking in, in this story, and she was doing things like Going Aggro or Siezing by Force, things went badly. She often got badly hurt, things got out of control, nothing really got solved by it. Her propensity to violence always got her in trouble, which was beautifully illustrated by her low Hard score. But man, she was one tough gal.<br/><br/>The rules affect what happens in the fiction as we play. The result of the rules is the story. But they don't apply outside of the story (to me). Heck, the reason we're interested in this story might even be that it's different from how things normally work! In this story, the heroes grow with the challenge and defeat the bad guy. We wouldn't be interested in them otherwise, and thus the rules causes this to happen. Sort of an anthropic principle of rules. In the ruleset, being defeated increases your chances of beating the bad guy in the end. In the world, the opposite is true. Being defeated makes it even harder. That makes it even more impressive that the character managed to come back from that defeat, and the rules make sure they do, since if they didn't we wouldn't be interested in this story.<br/><br/>I guess this is author stance. The ability of James Bond to get out of trouble doesn't depend on how smart he is or what weapon he has. It depends on where we are in the story, what's at stake, and what the consequences of failure would be. Those are the rules of a story, and if you're playing a story, those are the rules the rules system should emulate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478307/#Comment_478307" name="Item_114" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-30T06:52:23+00:00" title="November 30, 2018  6:52AM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does this mean that rules can be associated or dissociated from the story, as well as ass/diss from the world simulation?

Supporters of the concept could show that gamey / social (presentation of) rules are less useful in OSR, for instance. I just tried to find an example and I couldn't find one. In other words, how would Hit points be detrimental to OSR if they were presented functionnally as "just points" without any effort from the player to go beyond that ? I guess he'd just ask "how do I get more HPs" when low on them. <br/><br/>I am convinced (subjectively that is) that having a sleek seamless design, built around very few strong intuitive concepts is better than a complex architecture where designer and player alike run more risk of losing sight of conflicting intents, patching for sim here, narrative there.

(part 1/?)<br/><br/>It seems to me there are two general, distinct approaches to mechanical analog-game rules - their design, implementation and use in game-play:<br/><br/><b>A</b>) <i>rules that attempt to represent, describe or simulate</i> a fictional or real-world object, phenomenon, relation or quality, to some degree of abstraction.<br/>Both the "Finchian trap-finding", rulings-not-rules OSR approach and the "fiction first" approach of AW, among others, appear to me to be subsets of this "A" type.<br/><br/><b>B</b>) <i>rule-first mechanics, that are "just" rules</i> and don't even attempt to signify anything. Rules such as "we take turns framing scenes going around the table clockwise". Both in designing and in applying such rules, their adherence to any non-rule entity is seen as of no consequence: what does matter is their effectiveness towards some end goal (functional or expressive).<br/><br/>This A/B split is not exclusive to role-playing games. It is in fact a big deal in tabletop war-game, board-game and computer-game design, as far as I know (are "eurogames" a movement toward B in board-gaming?). It was a (sore) point of contention in my enjoyment (or not) of <i>Magic: the Gathering</i> as a child. It does have special implications for role-playing games, though.<br/><br/>The A/B split can refer to individual items of rules, but also to whole games (in both actual meanings of the word). When looking at whole games, it is <i>not</i> just a matter of whether the majority of the game's rules are A or B... Looking at a "game" as designed object, which was the designer's approach - why were the rules designed that way? Looking at a "game" as an instance of play, i.e. a game we're playing together, which is the "correct" approach by which we choose our moves, in the moment?<br/><br/>I say "distinct approaches", despite it would appear logical to place games on a continuum of increasing abstraction from A to B: isn't chess an extremely abstracted representation of a medieval European battlefield? For practical purposes, however, it is more useful to think of this A/B dichotomy as a sharp divide (or fuzzy divide, perhaps?).<br/>When designing a chess variant, or refining chess tournament rules, I don't believe anybody seriously ever thinks: "Hey, but actual historical cavalry could only charge in a straight line! Knights shouldn't move in an L shape, then!" or "Why isn't a rook stationary if it represents a fortress?" A player who refused to move their rooks, ever, on the grounds that rooks <i>are</i> castles would be <i>playing chess wrong</i> (in principle - it might be that keeping your rooks stationary is the winning move in this particular game, I wouldn't know).<br/>This is why I resisted using the word "abstract" to define B-type rules, by the way. Past a certain degree of abstraction, whatever fictional or real-world reference the rule or game originally "stood for" becomes irrelevant to both rule-design and game-play.<br/><br/>As role-playing games are games of fiction (i.e., that fiction, aka "diegesis", aka the "shared imagined space", aka the <i>conversation</i> is the field where play happens) all rules bear a necessary relationship to the fiction. Dice &amp; clouds. Within this specific design space, type A and type B both occur.<br/><br/>But this is it for now. In a future post, I will attempt to show how both A and B relate to the fiction in role-playing game. This being the topic of the thread, I will also illustrate my opinion that the feeling of "dissociation" is actually a property of approach A (when done wrong, i.e. rules-design is weak), <i>not</i> approach B. Perhaps of type-B rules misunderstood by players approaching them from angle A?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478310/#Comment_478310" name="Item_117" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-30T12:02:44+00:00" title="November 30, 2018 12:02PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 30, 2018 12:08PM by DeReel.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great !

So Fate points have rules that are both in "column A" and "column B"<br/><br/>My suspicion is that many of the rules concepts that people object to as "dissociated" at the ones that don't fit cleanly into one category or the other -- often because they are a collection of rules around a thing rather than a single rule.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478320/#Comment_478320" name="Item_119" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-30T15:28:06+00:00" title="November 30, 2018  3:28PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DeReel" rel="nofollow">DeReel</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I am convinced (subjectively that is) that having a sleek seamless design, built around very few strong intuitive concepts is better than a complex architecture where designer and player alike run more risk of losing sight of conflicting intents, patching for sim here, narrative there.

Same with HP, it isn't a measure of anything physical in the fiction. There's another point of view/philosophy applying here: it's the Narrative. <br/><br/>In the case of Fate Points the logic applied is narrative: heroes are supposed to get in trouble and do epic things to get out of them. That's it. If you are familiar with this kind of stories, this logic makes perfect sense. It has nothing to do with Karma. It's more related to the genre. When you keep this in mind, the rule is<i> associated</i>, as it produces a particular form of fiction. Try to force it to represent anything in the fiction or fight the concept that the hero must get in trouble and do epic stuff to get out (because in the real world or X source things never go that way, it's unrealistic, blah, blah), and it becomes a <i>dissociated</i> mechanic that will ruin your immersion.<br/><br/>In the case of HP, it's a narrative type of resource, one that determines when your character loses immediate agency in the fiction. If the game is about physical conflict, it makes sense you lose agency when your character loses a physical conflict, so HP is reduced when you get hit. When it goes to zero, your character "loses consciousness" and you've got no more agency. If the game deals with stress, terror, etc, it makes sense to have Sanity as a resource, which works in a similar way.<br/><br/>Of course, it's easier at the table and even in rulebooks to explain Fate points as Karma and HP as life. "You get fate points for getting in trouble and spend it to get more agency or be awesome, like, err... Karma, I think?" and click, the players get the idea. "You lose HP if you get hit and fall unconscious when you get to zero" "It's like my life then?" "Well, yes!" -and now you all can start playing.<br/><br/>Rules can either try to represent something in the fictional world, be there to help produce a specific effect in the story or do both at the same time. Some do it in a more efficient way. Some build specific events in the fiction in a nice way but fail when applied to special cases. Some are generic enough to enable players multiple interpretations, but may require an experienced player/GM to translate them properly.<br/><br/>So, if any part of a rule, it's application, the moments when the players/gm trigger it and choose to apply it. etc go wrong, stall the flow or produce consequences in the fiction that doesn't resonate with players expectations, it becomes dissociated. How do you know it isn't an absolute right/wrong thing? When other groups use it just fine and have no problems with it. How do you know it's incomplete in the corebook? When too many of those groups report adding a ruling to make it work and the designer confirms that's the way he plays it (only that he forgot to put that in the book because he internalized the ruling so much he thought "it's common sense and everyone will know it")<br/><br/>Like, consecutive strenght checks by different characters should be allowed only when the weaker PC goes first, as it makes sense that if a stronger character tried it before and couldn't, then why a weaker character would obtain a better result?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478330/#Comment_478330" name="Item_124" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-30T19:04:20+00:00" title="November 30, 2018  7:04PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think WarriorMonk is on to something with "dissociated" actually meaning "A rule or concept that has been divorced from what it actually describes" -- i.e. a rule or concept that is there for narrative purposes, when viewed by a person who doesn't want narrative things in their game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlexanderWhite" title="AlexanderWhite"><img alt="AlexanderWhite" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlexanderWhite">AlexanderWhite</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478332/#Comment_478332" name="Item_125" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-30T19:12:41+00:00" title="November 30, 2018  7:12PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, associated means I\u2019m making a decision that is roughly analogous to my characters decision, which is the Alexandrians definition as well.

When used consistently, all sessions with a particular ruleset will share some defining traits. Even "world/physics simulation", to me, is a genre. So, for me, it's all about verisimilitude, not realism, where a game lays down it's own goals and then can be measured by whether he delivers the kind of fiction it promised.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478335/#Comment_478335" name="Item_127" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-30T19:51:42+00:00" title="November 30, 2018  7:51PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 30, 2018 7:54PM by hamnacb.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Airk" rel="nofollow">Airk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The problem is that many rules don't fit clearly into A/B and most RPG GAMES don't either.</p></div></blockquote>\nI think the main difference is in our culture and not in the rules themselves. It is an attitute towards rules (and other social structures), not just in gaming but in real life.<br/><br/>How do we percieve rules? It depends on our needs and values. What is more important, variety or predictability? Chaos or order? How much do we trust rules? Do we give up our instincts and follow them or avoid them when they seem to stand innour way? Etc.<br/><br/>BTW A and B looks similar to my 'rules as toys or tools' or Silmenume's bricolouring vs engineering dychotomy.<br/><br/>Of course some games are created this way or that way. Traditional games are made by bricolouring existing rules. Designing from scratches also existed but only the forge made it into a subculture. <br/><br/>This does not mean than they cannot be played with the other approach. You could try to use MLwM for dungeon delving with bricolouring. And most of the clashes between D&amp;D players might originate from these different attitudes.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478338/#Comment_478338" name="Item_128" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-30T20:36:33+00:00" title="November 30, 2018  8:36PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" rel="nofollow">EmmatheExcrucian</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Those things were all problems.

I would say that number 2 is the most interesting and relevant, in terms of the present discussion, and number 4 is also relevant.<br/><br/>Numbers 1, 5 and 6 are matters of different distribution of authority. Tabletop gaming usually has most people controlling the intents of a characters, while the outcomes of the intents and the rest of the fiction is controlled by game master and rules. I do not think this is any more associated than the typical forum freeform, where (as far as I know and remember) everyone has one, or maybe more, characters they have basically veto rights over (as long as they remember to not godmode or however it is expressed), and everything else can be narrated pretty freely.<br/><br/>Number three is a matter of personal skills like arithmetic.<br/><br/>I am very surprised by number two being a problem. I do not know the background of the player, but around here schools tend to rate people by how good they are at various activities and they use set phrases or numbers to do this. This is common in computer games and various services where one rates hotels or movies or whatever. So I find it highly surprising that they have problems with the idea of a character being described in such a manner.

Well, as OP shows in points 5 and 6, this concept (the handle) is so linked to judgement (the blade) that it's going to be hard to do anything else with it. Even brandishing the pummel or saying the sword's name is enough for flaming a war. It's a sort of Godwin point. Why insist ?

Thus far, the only potential counterexample to "easier to teach" I have encountered is the player Emma mentioned.<br/><br/>I do not recall historical examples where an rpg theory concept that is in wide use has been renamed and the new name enforced successfully.

An extreme example would be playing a fate mage who draws karma and luck from others and otherwise manipulates it. Certainly an interesting archetype and worth allowing in many genres of fantasy where karma is a thing.

A trap spell that consumes or corrupts other spells or clones itself and fills the entire brain? Spellthieves that steal spells from others, maybe as a character class? A spell that can hold two other spells and, when released, release them?<br/>(A number of these types of things have been implemented mechanically in various editions of D&amp;D with various ways of associating the form of magic, or without such.)<br/><br/>As associated and a dissociated mechanic have different features.

I mean, not even in Vance is magic so predictable or quantified, and I'd find it hilarious if I ever read a novel where mages talked about their spell slots by level per day. Again, in my experience players just don't ask any questions and go along with those rules, perhaps they find d&amp;d rules easier to grasp due to a life playing videogames.<br/><br/>I think my biggest takeaway from the thread is that an honest application of the ass/diss concept should label most rules in most games as dissociated, especially d&amp;d rules.<br/><br/>But not to be so negative, I found the discussion useful to analyze how different have Burning and PbtA games been in my experience:<br/><br/>PbtA games try to stem rules trigger and changes in the fiction from the fiction itself, and thus seem more friendly to new players, since they can mostly resort to just describe what their characters are doing, and the GM will trigger the necessary rules.<br/><br/>Whereas Burning Games seem to impose a structure to the fiction that comes from the outside (rules), and some players will try to struggle with those limits, thinking about what would make sense in the fiction, when it doesn't work that way for, say, Torchbearer. Moreover, in Burning Games players can't just say what their characters are doing, they should engage the mechanics at least to some extent, or they'll struggle a lot against the game and miss opportunities.<br/><br/>I obviously enjoy both, but Burning Games take a bigger toll in me as a GM, as I need to remind players their options and overcome their initial resistance. But interestingly, Burning Games make it easier for me to impose an atmosphere where their resources are limited and there's constant pressure, whereas in Pbta it's a bit easier to hold your hand a bit when handling the opposition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478362/#Comment_478362" name="Item_131" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-01T18:32:45+00:00" title="December  1, 2018  6:32PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">@Thanuir</a>,<br/><br/>If you look at some of the comments here, you'll notice that Emma was talking about that player as an example of something she's seen a lot.

It just depends on the mindset with which a given player approaches the activity of roleplaying.<br/><br/>(I'd imagine that groups which are very rigid about their style of roleplay will effectively "weed those people out" fairly quickly, however, and end up playing only with people who DO align with this point of view.

(I'd imagine most straightforward task resolution mechanics like these would be considered "associated" by people who look at gaming in this way.)<br/><br/>However, in practice, it depends a great deal on the application of the rule, and how and when the rolls are called for.<br/><br/>For instance, imagine you are sneaking towards an opponent, trying to slowly gain ground to get close to them. We are, perhaps, going back and forth between you and other players as the scene/situation progresses, and the tension is high. Can you get within reach of your enemy before you're spotted?<br/><br/>Does the GM constantly ask for new Stealth rolls from you, every time your actions are being described? That aligns nicely with the tension of the moment, and might "feel" appropriate - after all, the character is constantly trying to keep quiet and out of sight, and it could go wrong at any moment.<br/><br/>However, doing that means that the character's odds of success drop very quickly - after all, it just takes one failed roll to be noticed; roll enough times and you'll get a failure sooner or later. That doesn't work well for the stealthy character, and a savvy player would avoid such a situation, rush forward to try to reduce the number of rolls made, or some other choice which could potentially feel quite "dissociated" from the fiction.<br/><br/>I can easily imagine a conversation where the player says, "I do this!", the GM replies, "Ok, make another Stealth roll!", and the player is forced to think, "Wait a minute! Is there something different I can do which *wouldn't* trigger another Stealth check? I'd rather do that."<br/><br/>On the other hand, some groups might impose something like a Let It Ride rule, where a single roll is intended to model a larger scope of action - basically, the attitude is that the one roll you made represents your skill and your ability to stay quiet under these circumstances, so that result should hold throughout the scene/encounter/situation, at least until circumstances change.<br/><br/>A very reasonable way to handle the abstraction of the task resolution roll, and avoids the problems of the first method. However, now a different problem crops up: when the GM goes back to the stealthy character's player and say, "Ok, what do you do next?", the player knows that they *won't be spotted*, taking a lot of the tension out of the situation. (At best, the player knows that she just has to avoid narrating any actions or behaviour which might cause the GM to ask for another roll, as above.)<br/><br/>To me, this is a good example of why speaking of "dissociated mechanics" is a really strange and misleading construction. What matters to me is gameplay and player decisions; in many cases, more "simulationist" or more highly "associated" mechanics don't actually produce the desired alignment of character and player concerns. I think there must be better ways to talk about this - the concept of "dissociation", to me, fails a number of litmus tests when seen in a broader context.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478365/#Comment_478365" name="Item_133" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-01T19:13:31+00:00" title="December  1, 2018  7:13PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 2, 2018 12:25AM by DeReel.">edited December 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Same here.

But I say no-no, it's not as ambitious as "a game is dissociated". It is more or less so. Like in some games, some players can easily picture things simulated by the rules. And in other games, some rules are just harder to represent with things in the fiction by some players.<br/><br/>Look, it's simple : one rule is, at a certain time, associated or not, for a certain person, according to the presentation of the rule the person has been exposed to. The fact is, when you read Fate rulebook, the authors probably don't try to give an "in fiction" rationale for Fate points. The rule is therefore dissociated.* <br/>* except it is "intuitively" associated by some players either well versed in fiction analysis, metaphysics, role playing or that simply have a potent solvent for imagination.**<br/>** which begs the question of whether that explanation or intuition must be shared among all players ? or only within expert community ?

And that's mostly it. <br/><br/>Am I correct <a href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">@Thanuir</a> ?</p></div></blockquote>\nI think this is pretty close and probably within the margin of error in communication of what I am trying to get at.<br/><br/>With respect to *: I think the question is, if there is only a single reasonable interpretation of the rule (for a given player, in a given culture, or however broadly one wants to look at it). If there are several different ones which people try to use at once in a given game, there might be misunderstandings and other trouble due to that.<br/><br/><br/>You see, I may have been confrontational and, certainly, I lost my cool, but I was earnestly trying to understand your concept. And I think I did partly but I have no certainty. That said, it could be interesting to go beyond that : what do you propose we do with the concept ? How was it useful to you ? What do you achieve with it (in the OSR space) ?<br/><br/>I trust your good intentions and do not carry a grudge.<br/><br/>This discussion here clarified to me the different challenges that would arise when trying to use a system with heavy simulative rules (like Pathfinder), versus the challenges when using a game like D&amp;D 4, for OSR-type play (solving fictional problems by  fictional means, GM as referee, etc.). I have experience with Pathfinder and OSR games; D&amp;D 4 is educated speculation, and I am (as always) interested in counterexamples.<br/><br/>With Pathfinder, the friction comes from simulating things poorly and from trying to associate class abilities (motivated by issues of game balance) and doing it poorly.<br/><br/>Simulating things poorly: Pathfinder has rules for example for crafting anything, for running a caravan, for social intrigue, for determining which magical items can be bought and sold and at how big cities, etc. Some of them are broken and some break when used at different level of abstractions than intended. Some simply reflect a different type of game world than one would prefer.<br/><br/>Associating class abilities: A nice example is the bombs class feature of an alchemist. The alchemist can create bombs and throw them at the same rate as an archer fires arrows (roughly speaking; a little slower if the archer is focused on rate of fire, which mechanically optimized ones do). During the same process the alchemist decides whether the bomb is of the usual kind, or maybe one that deals acid damage, etc, which presumably alters the ingredients of the bomb. Also, the containers used by the bombs are created during usual downtime.<br/>The alchemist is a solid and fun class by the standards of the Pathfinder community, but it is pretty obvious it has been created mechanics first, with fairly flimsy justifications associating them. I guess this is a specific case of the previous source of friction, but maybe notable in that most of the non-character rules do seem to simulate something, more or less, in a manner that makes it interesting to play (or tries to), whereas the class has the priorities reversed.<br/><br/>With D&amp;D 4, or other effects-first design, one faces different issues. Giving post-hoc justifications for how the martial characters slides others around or how a gelatinous cube  is tripped is not satisfactory, since we want to focus on the fictional details and clever use thereof. We want some powers to not work and others to work well based on the circumstances in the fiction. So there is a large number of rules the group needs to associate - interpret and agree to - during or before play.<br/><br/>Similar reasoning applies when modifying or adding to an OSR ruleset. If it is an abstraction, then is it an abstraction of the type where it is easy to go into more detail or zoom out, or is it somehow brittle? Does it model the kind of fiction one wants to? If it is dissociated, then how easy or cumbersome is it to associate and how necessary is this for play, or is it even fruitful to keep it dissociated?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478392/#Comment_478392" name="Item_135" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-02T13:49:25+00:00" title="December  2, 2018  1:49PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 2, 2018 6:11PM by DeReel.">edited December 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Applied to these games (I never played) this seems to work very well !

Is there something different I can do which *wouldn't* trigger another Stealth check? I'd rather do that."</p></div></blockquote>\nThis can be still be explained/decided from a purely in-character POV ("Wait a minute! Is there something different I can do which *wouldn't* put me on risk of being spotted? I'd rather do that."), therefore it's still associated.<br/><br/>Same with the case of the group ruling that the character doesn't need any more stealth roll ("Great, I succeeded putting myself in a position that grants me I won't be spotted, at least until I do something exceedingly flashy/noisy.").<br/><br/>In my opinion (feel free to disagree), some people make some mistakes about the interpretation of dis/association:<br/><br/>- Implying that a definition is not useful at all unless you can always clear-cut apply it. What's the exact point where something is not "small" anymore but "big"? Are "small" and "big" useless concepts? Light/heavy? Bright/dark? Short/tall? \u2026<br/><br/>- Implying an ethical connotation ("ass=good, diss=bad"). I find it wrong and misleading. What it can be is being good/bad at supporting a particular playing style (as any rule anyway, nothing excitingly new here, right?).<br/><br/>- Thinking that "associating" means "giving a rationale". If the rationale works at the player's level, but not at the character's level (like for a rule meant to give a certain narrative flavour) then it's not association. (Again, that doesn't mean the rule is bad.) Generally, from my understanding I'd say that any rule that puts the player in author's stance rather than actor's stance is disassociated, no matter how reasonable and well explained. Similarly, any resource management that can't happen in-character is disassociated.<br/><br/>Lastly - as side note - I think Fate points are still disassociated, no matter how karma-fuelled your imagined world is. For example, they reset to three unless you have more at the end of the session; and their management requires an author's stance: there's no way a character could think "My performance for this task is almost good enough but not quite, I <i>could</i> decide it's better, but I won't, because I'd rather get a better performance later", even with a real working karma. Which is OK, Fate is designed to require an author's stance anyway in lots of other places, so it doesn't make much sense to try to associate this particular rule.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478395/#Comment_478395" name="Item_137" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-02T18:12:57+00:00" title="December  2, 2018  6:12PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 2, 2018 6:19PM by David_Berg.">edited December 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>What matters to me is gameplay and player decisions; in many cases . . . more highly "associated" mechanics don't actually produce the desired alignment of character and player concerns.

I mean, I think "associated"/"dissociated", as defined, <i>is</i> a thing, but I think it's at least somewhat beside the point.  I think the more important point is:<br/>\u2022 What is the basis of fictional causality in this game?<br/>\u2022 Is this rule compatible with that?<br/><br/>For example, "whenever you do try to do something undetected, roll your Stealth score" fails spectacularly* at compatibility with a "real-world physics" basis of fictional causality, but fits quite nicely with an "espionage movie" basis of fictional causality.  (Or with a "whatever the mechanics dictate" basis of fictional causality, of course.  <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> )<br/><br/>* <small>1. Being undetected in one situation/action requires completely different skills than being undetected in another situation/action.  <br/>2. In traversing terrain, what matters is knowing what to look for, and assessing if there is in fact an option to be stealthy, and if so, taking that option.  A cautious player playing a cautious character can do this themselves with no reference to any ability scores, just by asking the GM useful questions and acting on the answers.<br/>3. Even in matters of character skill, it is extremely rare to find a "maybe" situation which suits a die roll; the majority of the time, in the real world, you can either do something or you can't.</small> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478396/#Comment_478396" name="Item_138" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-02T19:21:14+00:00" title="December  2, 2018  7:21PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 2, 2018 7:24PM by Paul_T.">edited December 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Indeed.<br/><br/>While <a href="/forums/profile/emarsk">@emarsk</a> makes some other good points, what I was trying to illustrate with my example of the "Stealth check" was the following:<br/><br/>* There is a mechanic which most people thinking from this perspective would consider highly "associated": the "Stealth check".<br/><br/>* I illustrated two different ways a GM or group could apply the rule, in practice.<br/><br/>* Imagine those two applications taking place in <i>exactly the same fictional situation</i>, with the player making exactly the same decisions.<br/><br/>Nothing is different about the fiction, the descriptions we're making, or the choices being made... and yet the implications for in-character decisions and how we engage with the game are completely different.<br/><br/>That's something you can't get from an armchair analysis of a rule in a rulebook.<br/><br/>Making our application of the rules line up with the fictional causality of the game, genre, and playstyle we're involved in is a matter of many different factors, in my opinion.<br/><br/>How familiar are the players with the rules? (How much mental effort is required to go through the process?) Which aspects of the rules and our application of them align with the stuff we're saying at the table? What is the internal mental state of the player, and what is she capable of rationalizing or reframing in her mind as she plays? Do the procedures of play (including, say, rolling dice, drawing cards, adding or subtracting numbers, looking up rules, and so on) challenge the player, or are they familiar and require fairly little effort and attention?<br/><br/>A perfect example is how, with time and practice, players and groups learn to narrate their way around task resolution and hit points, so as to avoid moments of "dissociation". (For example, experienced D&amp;D players get used to saying, "I hit the orc in the face!", while actually hearing, "I'm *trying* to hit the orc in the face, and let's see how it actually turns out".) This consists of practice, habits, and becomes ingrained over time.<br/><br/>I think that a group that has only ever played Primetime Adventures and suddenly picks up D&amp;D (as total novices) would experience most of the D&amp;D rules as <i>extremely dissociated</i>, and have trouble feeling involved or immersed in the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478397/#Comment_478397" name="Item_139" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-03T01:27:21+00:00" title="December  3, 2018  1:27AM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think people need to remember that this whole "Dissociated/Associated" split sprang from the mind of people from the traditional RPG scene -- people who are used to playing in Actor Stance and who value their "immersion" -- as a means of explaining why certain rules didn't work for them.  The argument that dissociation is meaningless because some people actually have any EASIER time with dissociated rules is therefore in my opinion irrelevant.  The distinction exists, and is disruptive to some people (generally: People who play a lot of D&amp;D.)<br/><br/>Maybe you can argue that it's not a particularly clear distinction, but I think at this point we've successfully disproved the idea that it's a concept that exists only to justify a preference.

The argument that dissociation is meaningless because some people actually have any EASIER time with dissociated rules is therefore in my opinion irrelevant.  The distinction exists, and is disruptive to some people (generally: People who play a lot of D&amp;D.)<br/><br/>Maybe you can argue that it's not a particularly clear distinction, but I think at this point we've successfully disproved the idea that it's a concept that exists only to justify a preference.

It pretty clearly exists only to justify a preference, since, as many have already stated and you've just accepted, a lot of gamers don't share their same priorities. How is a concept only valid for a fraction of gamers a valid tool to analyze all rules in all games?<br/><br/>I don't think the whole "ass/diss" thing is an objective way to classify rules, and it seems to me very clear that not even d&amp;d holds up when analyzed by this concept (specially not d&amp;d). To me, it's merely that a bunch of gamers are too accustomed to one school of design, to an extent where anything even slightly different won't seem like an RPG to them.

When they do not, there's really no friction or problem. (For instance, D&amp;D XP rules are quite clearly "dissociated" in most formulations, but this doesn't usually play into character decisions in fictional problem-solving, so there's no problem there. "Director stance" narration powers, however, are not a good match for problem-solving... except when they are separate from the important activity of play. There is absolutely no problem to writing a backstory for your character, describing the dress of your servants, or roleplaying the behaviour of your horses in the stable; we just can't mix those activities in any haphazard way. It's no different to other challenges in roleplaying, in my opinion - wide-open narration powers can short-circuit meaningful conflict in story games, too, so I don't see it as a feature that's particular to any particular playstyle.)<br/><br/>Ultimately, having a sense of what a game is about and why we're playing it, and then aligning our tools to suit that goal is the key to all successful roleplaying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478442/#Comment_478442" name="Item_154" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-03T20:28:37+00:00" title="December  3, 2018  8:28PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 3, 2018 9:03PM by DeReel.">edited December 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Given that some associated rules also are a bad match for in fiction problem solving, that leaves a poor yield to the application of the concept. <br/>Where can we see this concept in action ?

Is that sort of natural evasion of a description a proof that a rule is associated?</p></div></blockquote>\nI would say:<br/><br/>Dissociated rule: Does not have a unique interpretation in the fiction.<br/>Associated, and believable: Has a unique interpretation in the fiction and the interpretation is genre-appropriate (such as realistic) and can be imagined by the player.<br/>Associated, but unbelievable: Has a unique interpretation in the fiction, but it is not consistent with how the player imagines the world or the genre.<br/><br/>Magic missile spell might be imagined in any number of ways. If the rule is treated as dissociated, everyone might be imagining it in different ways or not at all, and this does not really matter for play.<br/>But, if you are trying to use magic missile while sneaking around, or while trying to scare or impress someone, or when trying to signal from ship to another via light effects, suddenly the precise manifestation of the spell matters. If you can choose it at will, it is a lot more flexible and powerful spell, than if you are restricted to a given visual and auditory or emotional or whatever manifestation. If people think about such things and discuss them, the rule is associated or in the process of becoming such.<br/>On the other hand, if people react negatively and comment on the realism of a rule, or just to learn to ignore the relevant narration, maybe the rule is associated but bad, or maybe they are dissociating it (turning it into a dissociated rule), probably because it is unbelievable.<br/><br/>Houseruling is also a typical reaction to associated but unbelievable rules.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Hit points are actually a really good example of the kind of thing that happens with this issue:<br/><br/>When a group is happy enough to describe things in abstract terms, hit points are satisfying and feel quite associated. <br/><br/> Those groups that look for higher fictional detail, though, start running into the edges of the abstraction, and often will have difficulty with the concept, finding it dissociated, in contrast. <br/><br/>e.g. "He swings at you with the giant axe! ...it's a hit, take 12 damage."<br/><br/>"Ok! But wait... did he hit me? Because I can't arrive at the meeting with the Queen if I have blood on my tunic. And how hard?

Right?"<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nI use the words in a different way.<br/><br/>If the hit points are kept abstract and not tied to the fiction, they are dissociated.<br/><br/>If the groups looks for a higher amount of fictional detail and comes to the difficulties presented above, they are treating the hit points as an associated mechanic, but finding it a flawed representation.<br/><br/>They are likely to either dissociate the mechanic, change the game, change the rule, or come to a better interpretation of the mechanic.\n<blockquote><br/>The decisions of the players, and how they are reached and modified in play, is far more interesting and improtant, I think, than classifying those mechanics as associated or not.<br/></blockquote>\nThe classifications can be a useful starting point and can make explicit some differences that are there, but might not occur to people.

I think this would be a worthwhile topic to consider and explore.<br/><br/>Off the top of my head, I can think of two better models for this kind of discussion: the first is David_Berg's breakdown of what rules might or might not do, earlier in this thread, and the second is Vincent Baker's "Dice and Clouds" series.<br/><br/>2. I don't think anyone  has said that explicitly, but I can see where people might get that impression - it's strongly implied.<br/><br/>For instance, the Alexandrian (and others) seem to suggest that, for instance, D&amp;D4E was less successful commercially because it had more dissociated mechanics.<br/><br/>You've said a few times in this thread that associated mechanics are easier for new players to learn, less likely to confuse people, and make it easier to play the game successfully, or something along those lines (I could probably find the quotes if you'd like).<br/><br/>Since some people's experience has been the opposite (like Emma), I can see why some people might bristle at such implications. I don't think anyone hasn't been hostile or offensive, though - it's just been a minor point of disagreement, as far as I can see.<br/><br/>(That's not true of other discussions using the terms, though, like people claiming that games with dissociated mechanics aren't "really roleplaying" and other such nonsense. I can well<br/>Imagine that some people might be reacting to that, as well.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478673/#Comment_478673" name="Item_159" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-06T20:07:55+00:00" title="December  6, 2018  8:07PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 6, 2018 9:13PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited December 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Haha, it seems that within the space of a single forum post the terms \u201cAssociated and Dissociated\u201d have been interpreted differently by almost everyone, taken on a number of alternate definitions, and become about as useful and precise as the term \u201cStory Game.\u201d<br/><br/>When will we learn that the rath of Satan befalls anyone who would dare to try to create a theoretic RPG term. <img alt=":wink:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=":wink:"/> <br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478709/#Comment_478709" name="Item_160" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-07T19:19:51+00:00" title="December  7, 2018  7:19PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think it's a coincidence that many people would define "story game" as "a game with lots of dissociated mechanics", Jeff! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478785/#Comment_478785" name="Item_161" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-08T19:30:42+00:00" title="December  8, 2018  7:30PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I don't think it's a coincidence that many people would define "story game" as "a game with lots of dissociated mechanics", Jeff! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/></p></div></blockquote>\nWithout a doubt the Illuminati and Free Masons are involved.

In other words, how would Hit points be detrimental to OSR if they were presented functionnally as "just points" without any effort from the player to go beyond that ?

The door swings to slam the one who was hiding. How do we adjudicate effects if hit points are a purely formal construction?<br/><br/>1. Maybe the game has explicit rules for this. I do not remember any in Pathfinder/D&amp;D 3, so I doubt most games have such, and including them is not a very clever thing to do.<br/><br/>2. We, the people playing the game (or some subset thereof) consider what would happen in such a circumstance, genre and realism and what not considered, and how to translate that into the rules, to the extent relevant in the game system. I think we figured it would hurt but not as much as if the door had not been there, so half damage and stagger some steps backwards. Also, the rolled damage was pretty big, so everyone agreed to the door having a crack, now. We used the intuition of hit points being a measure of pain and damage; that is, we used the fictional association of the hit points.<br/><br/>3. "It is not written in the rules, so it is not possible. Please try an action that is boring enough for it to be codified by the rules."

I do wonder how these people cope with, for example, star ratings of hotels and movies, school grades, and all kinds of feedback expressed in words and numbers.<br/>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Does the GM constantly ask for new Stealth rolls from you, every time your actions are being described? That aligns nicely with the tension of the moment, and might "feel" appropriate - after all, the character is constantly trying to keep quiet and out of sight, and it could go wrong at any moment.<br/><br/>However, doing that means that the character's odds of success drop very quickly - after all, it just takes one failed roll to be noticed; roll enough times and you'll get a failure sooner or later. That doesn't work well for the stealthy character, and a savvy player would avoid such a situation, rush forward to try to reduce the number of rolls made, or some other choice which could potentially feel quite "dissociated" from the fiction.<br/><br/>I can easily imagine a conversation where the player says, "I do this!", the GM replies, "Ok, make another Stealth roll!", and the player is forced to think, "Wait a minute! Is there something different I can do which *wouldn't* trigger another Stealth check? I'd rather do that."<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nA classical example, indeed.<br/><br/>The way I would frame this, in an OSR context, is to consider how easy it would for an average person to succeed at those tasks and set the difficulty and number of rolls based on that. Then we can have the interesting, fiction-based discussion of how easy or hard it is to sneak around in this particular situation. and how to improve the chances, and if you ask for rolls every meter than nobody can ever sneak to any place and that is not realistic/does not emulate the genre, because I have sneaked around and so did Tarzan.<br/>(The solution, in an extended sneaking scenario, might be to roll once every N minutes and whenever you do something that requires attention or might make noise, with N calibrated according to the situation.)<br/><br/>For a contrast, consider a game where a story consists of three dangerous scenes and you have two plot points. Use a plot point to triumph. Otherwise the character fails. Here, if the situation is declared as dangerous (which it presumably is as you are sneaking around), the outcome and the resolution is completely disjoint from the fiction. Someone will hopefully narrate an interesting cinematography of sneakery.<br/><br/>I would say the problem with the stealth skill comes, again, from an associated rule being bad or unfit for the game. I would say the particular problem is taking general abstract rules and not treating them as an abstraction that can be adjusted when it produces unrealistic/unemulative results, or, equivalently, taking the rules as the fundamental laws of physics of the game world.<br/>(An aside: Actual physics is a bunch of abstractions that work at particular levels in a good way, much like many "physics engine" roleplaying game rules. Thermodynamics, for example, is the art of ignoring what a single particle is doing and looking at what all of them are doing in aggregate, just like mass combat rules in traditional roleplaying games, and for the same purpose. Physicists also care about elegance of the mathematical representations and have to balance that against them producing results close enough to measurements. I do not know enough about string theory to say if comparing them to designers of formal games is accurate. "Rulings, not rules" is engineering, or using whichever solution works right here without trying to abstract it to cover all possible cases, but still basing it on known principles and laws, where possible.)\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DeReel" rel="nofollow">DeReel</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">@Thanuir</a> : it looks we're close to same-page, except I am not sure your concept is the same as TheAlexandrian 's, hence the renaming.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nI am not sure, either.

When they do not, there's really no friction or problem. (For instance, D&amp;D XP rules are quite clearly "dissociated" in most formulations, but this doesn't usually play into character decisions in fictional problem-solving, so there's no problem there. "Director stance" narration powers, however, are not a good match for problem-solving... except when they are separate from the important activity of play. There is absolutely no problem to writing a backstory for your character, describing the dress of your servants, or roleplaying the behaviour of your horses in the stable; we just can't mix those activities in any haphazard way. It's no different to other challenges in roleplaying, in my opinion - wide-open narration powers can short-circuit meaningful conflict in story games, too, so I don't see it as a feature that's particular to any particular playstyle.)</p></div></blockquote>\nYes, precisely.      <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DeReel" rel="nofollow">DeReel</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Given that some associated rules also are a bad match for in fiction problem solving, that leaves a poor yield to the application of the concept. <br/>Where can we see this concept in action ?

I think this would be a worthwhile topic to consider and explore.<br/><br/>Off the top of my head, I can think of two better models for this kind of discussion: the first is David_Berg's breakdown of what rules might or might not do, earlier in this thread, and the second is Vincent Baker's "Dice and Clouds" series.<br/><br/>2. I don't think anyone  has said that explicitly, but I can see where people might get that impression - it's strongly implied.<br/><br/>For instance, the Alexandrian (and others) seem to suggest that, for instance, D&amp;D4E was less successful commercially because it had more dissociated mechanics.<br/><br/>You've said a few times in this thread that associated mechanics are easier for new players to learn, less likely to confuse people, and make it easier to play the game successfully, or something along those lines (I could probably find the quotes if you'd like).<br/><br/>Since some people's experience has been the opposite (like Emma), I can see why some people might bristle at such implications. I don't think anyone hasn't been hostile or offensive, though - it's just been a minor point of disagreement, as far as I can see.<br/><br/>(That's not true of other discussions using the terms, though, like people claiming that games with dissociated mechanics aren't "really roleplaying" and other such nonsense. I can well<br/>Imagine that some people might be reacting to that, as well.)</div></blockquote>\n1. Maybe I'll reread those. I did not find Vincent's post on the matter particularly interesting when I first encountered it. Maybe I had already had those same ideas and the representation did not work for me.<br/><br/>2. I stand by what I wrote. In particular, I used Primetime adventures as an example which makes the formal rules more comprehensible by associating them with producing a tv series (IIRC).<br/><br/>For discussing what is a real roleplaying game, one has to draw the boundary somewhere. I draw it at shared creation of fiction, where verbal or written representation created by the players in a fairly free manner is a central component of play. This throws away solo play of Tunnels and trolls, many computer games (though an MMORPG where main content for some players is the social interaction of their characters would qualify), some very physical boffer larps, etc. Someone else would draw it at inhabiting a character, which keeps Fallout the computer games and solo Tunnels and trolls, but throws away Universalis and other games of shared story creation. For analytic purposes these kinds of divisions are clear and necessary, and one only has to be explicit about them. Without drawing the lines, analysis is impossible.<br/><br/>However, the definitions are also used for politics.<br/><br/>My impression of Alexandrian is that they are used for analysis, there, but the results are used for politics, too.<br/><br/>But this is another subject for another thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_480137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480137/#Comment_480137" name="Item_166" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-02-02T20:36:18+00:00" title="February  2, 2019  8:36PM">February 2</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanuir,<br/><br/>I'm glad that we have some points of common understanding. I do think this is an interesting and useful discussion.<br/><br/>However, I still feel that the "dissociated" label is overly simplistic and misses really important elements of how and why RPG rules actually work. The people I see using such distinctions tend to wield them as hammer, seeing everything as a nail, and, as a result, they go wrong as much as they go right.<br/><br/>My point with the "Stealth rolls" example is that your own preferred solution (to abstract the action using a smaller number of rolls) is, quite precisely, what you are arguing against: that using a more gameable abstraction, instead of a more closely "associated" technique, is actually preferable. I see these situations come up very often.<br/><br/>My second example (speaking about narrative authority) was meant to illustrate how this has to do a with a lot more features than just "associated" and "dissociated". If I'm playing <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, for instance, I am very explicitly NOT given narrative authority to declare that the Steward of the Town is actually secretly a "good guy", and in line with my beliefs. That would undercut the whole point of the game. Contrariwise, in a challenge-based adventure game like megadungeon-exploration OSR D&amp;D, there is no harm in allowing players to have narrative authority over what the cultural mores are in their homeland - in fact, the game will be better for it, in most cases. <br/><br/>It's not narrative authority itself that is the problem, in either case.<br/><br/>In my opinion, far more important than trying to figure out whether something is "associated" (which, as we've seen, is almost impossible) is determining what the purpose of our play is, and then using the tools we have to serve that purpose. <br/><br/>I like your analogy of "rulings, not rules" for engineering solutions. That seems quite apt to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_480144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480144/#Comment_480144" name="Item_167" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-02-02T22:21:07+00:00" title="February  2, 2019 10:21PM">February 2</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 2, 2019 10:36PM by DeReel.">edited February 2</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry, I'll pass.

In particular, it sounds very much like the problem where games feel "floaty" or allow for "lazy play" that occurs when a game lacks mechanics that respond to fictional causes (cloud-&gt;dice). But it doesn't seem like that is what it is really about at all. Or at least, is only partially about that. Taking the Alexandrian's example of a dissociated rule:\n<blockquote>...a character has the One-Handed Catch ability: Once per game they can make an amazing one-handed catch, granting them a +4 bonus to that catch attempt.<br/></blockquote>\nThis is absolutely a fictionally responsive mechanic, in that only when you are attempting to make a catch can you get +4 for the roll that attempt (cloud-&gt;dice). Even the "once per day" is fictionally responsive, because it's obviously fictional days, not actual days.<br/><br/>The Alexandrian's example of "re-associating" this mechanic is particularly enlightening:\n<blockquote>The player activates his gravitic force gloves (which have a limited number of charges per day) to pull the ball to his hand. Or he shouts a prayer to the God of Football who\u2019s willing to help him a limited number of times per day. Or he activates one of the arcane tattoos he had a voodoo doctor inscribe on his palms.</blockquote>\nBut check this out: Which one, of the two rules, continues to <i>re-invest</i> the fictional positioning with significance? Which one makes moment-to-moment positioning <i>continue</i> to matter beyond the immediate use of the move itself? Which one gives more meaning, context, and energy to the fictional positioning than it takes?<br/><br/>When you look at the One Handed Catch rule as first stated, it only has one element which is not associated to a fictional causal element, which is the "once per day" clause. "Once per day" does a good job of giving players a way of making the kinds of aesthetic judgement calls that are required for people use fictionally responsive rules. Has a day passed yet in the fiction? No? Then you can't use the ability again. But it doesn't have an in-fiction reason or cause in and of itself.<br/><br/>What giving "once per day" an in-fiction reason (like being a sci-fi gravity glove with a certain number of charges) does is invest more meaning into moment-to-moment play by making it conditional upon even more of the fiction. The magic one-handed catch is now gloves, existing as real things within the fiction. Can they be stolen, lost, broken? What if I forget to charge it? What if there's a power outage the night before? What if there's an EMP pulse?<br/><br/>Of course it's easier to make character-based decisions in that context! By contrast, the old "once per day" move is sluggish, almost extractive in nature. It doesn't feed new, relevant, context back in to the fiction. In fact, it operates at a context that is utterly irrelevant to the context of the action at hand. What does the day matter when you've got a football game to win?<br/><br/>Here's what I'm taking away:<br/><br/>What matters here is not whether or not it makes sense from a character's perspective, but whether a mechanic has a "corresponding reality within the fiction". It naturally follows that something with a corresponding reality within the fiction would aid one in making decisions from the perspective of their character, because that is something that the character could reasonably make decisions about and act upon, but the procedural implications are much broader.<br/><br/>It's not mechanics from the perspective of the character, but mechanics that, by being designed from the perspective of the fiction, re-charge the fiction (of which the character is necessarily a part) with continued and ongoing meaning relevant to the context in which the mechanic takes place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_480277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480277/#Comment_480277" name="Item_179" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-02-10T04:34:12+00:00" title="February 10, 2019  4:34AM">February 10</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I think that's much closer to it.<br/><br/>In theory, it's about whether the repercussions of the mechanics can make sense from an in-character perspective (note that the "charges in the glove" have to be known to the character, or at least discoverable by the character, for that rule to become associated - it's not just about the players!).<br/><br/>In practice, though, I find it has to do with familiarity more than anything.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_480278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480278/#Comment_480278" name="Item_180" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-02-10T09:04:51+00:00" title="February 10, 2019  9:04AM">February 10</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2019 9:12AM by DeReel.">edited February 10</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This looks very much like immersionnist metaphysics.<br/>Look : my football toon thinks the glove is magic.

I am frankly not sure I 100% understand fictional positioning as a term, so I may not be the best to weigh in. But I suspect, based on what I know about Justin Alexander and Vincent, they have very different end goals and ways of thinking about these things. With immersionists it is mainly about seeing things through your characters eyes, avoiding getting into meta mechanics that take you out of character etc. Of course quantity and trade offs matter matter here. The chief complaint if I recall with the Alexandrian's original article was it just felt so disconnected from to have mechanics for pretty mundane actions being Vancian. I think the problem with it is immersionists tend to think in terms of intent and don't like having content that is restrained by mechanics (even if those mechanics are there to enhance player impact on the setting). For something that is basically a mundane physical action that a person could try to succeed at all the time, they want to be able to try to succeed at it all the time, and not be limited by x per day or once per encounter. But again, not terribly knowledgeable the terminology being used regarding fictional positioning (though I have seen it come up in a number of discussions and explained by the posters using it).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_480283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480283/#Comment_480283" name="Item_183" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-02-10T16:14:38+00:00" title="February 10, 2019  4:14PM">February 10</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2019 9:55PM by DeReel.">edited February 10</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/KirkMitchell">@KirkMitchell</a> <br/>Sorry, then, if I misinterpreted.

I think existing in the fiction, seems slightly inaccurate here to me. It comes from a viewpoint that thinks in terms of setting and what is occurring in it. While my understanding is 'the fiction' can include the setting in that sense, it also seems like it has broader meaning than that (at least judging by the way I see it used on online discussions).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_480288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480288/#Comment_480288" name="Item_186" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-02-10T22:05:38+00:00" title="February 10, 2019 10:05PM">February 10</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will say this. I found the term dissociated to be very useful at the time it came out. It offered an explanation for something I was experiencing with 4th edition, and it seemed to hit on something that was really going on. I think one issue though is you can take that insight, which is useful in explaining the problem some people had with 4E because so much of the game felt that way to people; but take it too much to heart (i.e. any amount of dissociation is bad) or to fail to see there were other moving parts in the game that were also contributing to the negative reaction (just the way classes were structured around the Vancian powers would be an obvious one, where the negative reaction often had nothing or little to do with dissociation). Still I think it is useful. It is just helpful to remember why Justin Alexander came up with the term in the first place and why it caught on with so many people.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_480291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480291/#Comment_480291" name="Item_187" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-02-10T23:13:46+00:00" title="February 10, 2019 11:13PM">February 10</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2019 11:15PM by Paul_T.">edited February 10</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually think the "use this ability once per day" format is a pretty good example for the sake of this discussion.<br/><br/>It mingles in-fiction/diegetic limits (a "day" only exists in the game, in other words) with an arbitrary limitation which doesn't have any relevance to the actors in the fiction (the characters cannot understand that or interact with it in any way). That's poor design, in my opinion. (I was always frustrated with this kind of ability design from the very beginning, when I started playing D&amp;D as a kid, and I fully understand why having a label for something like this is handy.)<br/><br/>Where I have an issue with the concept of "dissociation" is just that it's <i>sloppy</i> - it's referring to a lot of unrelated things and grouping them all together, which makes it really easy to miscommunicate with each other when using it. <br/><br/>Let's take the One-Handed Catch again and look closer...<br/><br/>It's pretty interesting to consider how the following variations interact with a feeling of "dissociation", from form to form:<br/><br/>* Once per day, your character can use her One-Handed Catch ability, granting her a +4 to catch a ball.<br/><br/>* <i>Once per game session</i>, your character can use her One-Handed Catch ability, granting her a +4 to catch a ball.<br/><br/>Does that change the implications of the rule a little bit? It certainly makes clearer where the limitation lies, and that it has nothing to do with fictional causality. For some people, that changes how they view the rule.<br/><br/>How about:<br/><br/>* Once per game session, you may announce "...and that was when she made another amazing catch!" to the group, and then describe how she attempts a One-Handed Catch. Take +4 to your roll.<br/><br/>A little different again, right? <br/><br/>Now, how about:<br/><br/>* Once per game session, you may announce to the group that you are making a Character History Reveal. In-game events are paused while you may tell the group, as though describing a flashback, about a time when your character learned something about baseball from an important Backstory Figure in her past. Afterwards, when you resume play, take +4 to make your roll for the One-Handed Catch.<br/><br/>Each formulation of the rule moves us more clearly towards a form which is about <i>player interaction</i> (i.e. at the actual table), rather than something the <i>character</i> does. I'd imagine that every player will have a slightly different reaction to each version, depending on the context of the game they're playing, their play history, and so forth.<br/><br/>As another example, the way the rule is cued probably makes a difference, too.<br/><br/>For instance, "once a session, you may make a One-Handed Catch" can lead to uncomfortable moments, like where you might say, "I'm making a One-Handed Catch!", and then we have to try to remember if you've already done so that day or that session, and you have to choose something else if you've already depleted that ability. <br/><br/>That's not a fun thing for anyone, and produces a sort of "hiccup" in gameplay which is pretty unsatisfying. We have to effectively go back and start over. ("I'll do something else, instead, I guess!") No fun.<br/><br/>However, what if you give the player a card to hold? The card says, "Your character occasionally makes killer One-Hand Catches. Play this card, putting it in the discard pile, to gain a +4 to your Catch roll."<br/><br/>For a player who's familiar with the whole "discard a card to activate a special ability" trope, that might feel quite natural. And they certainly won't "accidentally" try to use the ability twice in a row, because they no longer have the card in front of them.<br/><br/>All these things influence how we perceive the rules and whether they cause hiccups in play or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_480292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480292/#Comment_480292" name="Item_188" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-02-10T23:18:50+00:00" title="February 10, 2019 11:18PM">February 10</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i><a href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">@Bedrockbrendan</a> - "fictional positioning" is just a fancy term for "the stuff we're imagining matters", nothing tricky.

I\u2019ve found found myself in negative interactions with people advancing that term as a step toward arguments for players having a hand in shaping setting content (what they would call the fiction) by either limiting normal GM authority or enhancing player authority and giving them meta resources or access to mechanics. I am not saying this stuff is bad. I just am wondering if fictional positioning naturally suggests people are negotiating over fictional outcomes rather than simply acting through their character. If so, someone bothered by dissociated mechanics would probably take issue as well with some of the assumptions imbedded in the term. Keep in mind most inmersionists are not even going to accept the term fiction to describe setting content. Like I said, this isn\u2019t a term I have a particularly good grasp of.

One thing that can happen in these discussions is equivocation around \u2018story\u2019 or \u2018fifction\u2019 gets used to people to accept conclusions that don\u2019t follow from their assumptions (i.e. there is a big difference in meaning between story or fiction that means fake stuff that happened in the game versus when it means a novel, literature or something that contends with meaningful themes). Personally I think using these words is fine, and I just make a point of pinning down the precise use to avoid equivocation. But personally \u2018fictional positioning\u2019 doesn\u2019t really click with me as a description of what goes on at the game table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_480305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480305/#Comment_480305" name="Item_194" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-02-11T13:38:34+00:00" title="February 11, 2019  1:38PM">February 11</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DeReel" rel="nofollow">DeReel</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>"I <br/><br/>- <br/><br/>Also : <br/>setting : the place or type of surroundings where something is positioned or where an event takes place "a romantic house in a wonderful setting beside the River Wye"<br/><br/>fiction : literature in the form of prose, especially novels, that describes imaginary events and people. synonyms:\tnovels, stories, creative writing, imaginative writing, works of the imagination, prose literature, narration, story telling<br/><br/>The fiction takes place in the setting, which is itself partially part of the fiction <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> Mind boggling ?

Not everyone views the stuff that happens as story or fiction as you defined it. If you are just using \u2018story\u2019 to mean \u2018stuff that happened\u2019, they might agree. But that definition of fiction carries many other assumptions with it that not everyone wants to bring into the game. For a lot of people they don\u2019t want or expect a story in that sense. They just want to play their character and see what happens as they interact with the setting and it\u2019s inhabitants. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_480314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/KirkMitchell" title="KirkMitchell"><img alt="KirkMitchell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/KirkMitchell">KirkMitchell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480314/#Comment_480314" name="Item_195" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-02-11T16:29:58+00:00" title="February 11, 2019  4:29PM">February 11</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 11, 2019 4:47PM by KirkMitchell.">edited February 11</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know if this is necessarily the thread to discuss fictional positioning per se, since we've already managed to drag association/dissociation so far away from its original meaning and context. But in any case, I think the bankuei article is actually very unclear on what fictional positioning actually is, and mixes it with a couple of other arguments that were contemporary to the time it was written in a way that is confusing. Whenever I'm referring to "the fiction" and "fictional positioning" I'm referring to it as defined in <a href="http://lumpley.com/index.php/anyway/thread/690" rel="nofollow">this article</a>.\n<blockquote>I just am wondering if fictional positioning naturally suggests people are negotiating over fictional outcomes rather than simply acting through their character.<br/></blockquote>\nSo close! There's no "rather than". As far as we're concerned here, "negotiating over fictional outcomes" and "simply acting through their character" are the same thing! Every action you take through your character is subject to the explicit or implicit assent of everyone else at the table. The "fiction" exists as a real thing, sure, but it is a real thing that is fundamentally shared with everyone else at the table. The fiction is, as the old jargon term puts it, a "shared imagined space". In order for anybody to say anything about the fiction, including "I hit the kobold with my axe", we have to share some kind of agreement about what has been established in the fiction and what hasn't (that I have an axe in hand and not, say, back on my horse or knocked away under a table; that the kobold is within range; etc.). What has been established at any given point in the fiction describes my fictional positioning: the range of possible moves that I as the player can make that everybody will accept because of our shared agreement.<br/><br/>(note that I haven't said anything about how we come to this agreement, or the division of "narrative authority" between different players such as GMs or in GM-less play, but simply that this agreement exists as the foundation of play)<br/><br/>There is no disagreement between this concept of fictional positioning and people who value immersion! "Immersion", at least in part, is an <i>effect</i> of a game or disciplined play-style which makes your fictional positioning meaningful to the process of play. Without fictional positioning being clearly established and made meaningful, it is impossible for you as the player to make the same decision as the character, because you have no (or a weak) fictional basis for making that decision.<br/><br/>What association/dissociation points out to me is that for some people simply investing the fiction with significance and making your positioning within the fiction mechanically meaningful is not, in itself, sufficient for immersion! They look beyond the fiction itself, to the experience of using the mechanics, and suggest that the existence of every mechanic and its operation in play could be subject to the fiction. I can't think of anything that would invest <i>more</i> meaning to your fictional positioning in play.<br/><br/>That's really cool! What an incredible design goal. If you do that, then not only will you be making the same decisions as your character, but the <i>only valid moves you can make as a player will be moves from your fictional positioning</i>. In a single-player single-character game, that would naturally mean acting from the perspective of your character.<br/><br/>So yeah. It's a good and useful idea, and after a long walk I've circled back to re-stating the concept in the same terms as the people who invented it! I'm just the kind of dummy that needs to re-build any new idea from first principles in order to understand it.<br/><br/>I'll talk about what I mean by "extractive" somewhere else, because it's an elaboration on these concepts that goes somewhere else entirely. A hint, though: it has to do with what I mean by "re-investment".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_480315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480315/#Comment_480315" name="Item_196" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-02-11T16:48:50+00:00" title="February 11, 2019  4:48PM">February 11</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 11, 2019 4:53PM by DeReel.">edited February 11</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, I dig that.

I think I am doing a bad job drawing a line between my descriptions of the conflict I've seen in threads involving immersion and terms like fictional positioning, my personal feelings, and what concepts resonate with me (been a long week so I apologize). My point was that I think fiction=stuff that happened, is fine. Just like story=stuff that happened is fine. Where I see immersionists butting heads with folks invoking "the fiction", particularly in conversations involving a concept like dissociated mechanics, is when the establishment of fiction to mean "stuff that happens" gets equivocated. So it goes from meaning "stuff the that happened" to another meaning like "narrative play" or "literature", etc. When this shift happens the two sides are now talking about two different things. Where this can matter is when people start arguing for what a game should do, how a game should be run etc. So I've seen discussions where fictional positioning was used to heavily emphasize the role of social negotiation, in order to advance something like "Say yes or roll the dice" as more ideal than the GM simply determining whether something is the case in a setting. Personally I am fine with words like fiction and story being used casually. I do have to admit 'fictional positioning' doesn't resonate very strongly with me as a concept, but that is just personal preference. <br/><br/>I think in terms of dissociated mechanics, that difference after the equivocation, can blur what the term is intended to cover. <br/><br/>I guess I raised the point because it is important to understand these discussions take place in the context of multiple gaming forums and communities across the net. When it comes to dissociated mechanics, understanding those dynamics, is pretty crucial to understanding the concept I think (because so much of it was forged in online flamewars over 4th edition, and often along the lines I describe in my above paragraph). Dissociated mechanics has an emotional weight that a lot of other gaming concepts don't. <br/><br/>I am trying to weigh in because I remember this concept when it was proposed and I've followed the Alexandrian for a while because I am a fan of his writing. Like I said earlier, I think it is helpful in identifying potential disruptors of immersion. But I think it can also be overused, and become too firm a line. One or two abilities that are disociated mechanics, especially if they rarely come up, are not that big a deal. Immersion isn't so fragile that a rare class ability will destroy it utterly. I think it is when the dissociated mechanics are prevalent that it really becomes an issue. So I do believe we've thrown out some babies with the bathwater in this respect.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P

"Fiction" for me has always really represented the literary structure and the story as a cohesive whole, and it's impossible to follow a structured blueprint when that structured blueprint doesn't exist because you're playing to find out. <br/>I think that just definitely reinforces what you meant about the different meanings though, since I'm pretty sure my definition there is very different from most people's definitions.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_480335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480335/#Comment_480335" name="Item_204" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-02-12T12:05:25+00:00" title="February 12, 2019 12:05PM">February 12</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Yeah, that's more or less how I look at it, too.

Justin Alexander was trying to wrap his head around why 4E bothered him (as were many others, myself included). It was one possible explanation and it seemed to explain a lot of our misgivings. I think he has greatly modified his position since its original posting, and I think a lot of people have changed their view over time as the emotions have faded. I think for the discussion of 4E, it was relevant and useful. Where it got to be a problem, wasn't the vagueness, it is actually an incredibly clear term in my view. The problem was it was applied too rigidly, too universally, without giving to thought on when dissociated mechanics were okay in play (because clearly before 4E, they were a thing, and existed, but they didn't bother D&amp;D players as much because they just were not as noticeable or they flew under the radar). I think with 4E it was the full embrace of them, that drove some people away (and I think again it wasn't just dissociated mechanics, it was a bunch of things 4E embraced). I think the way to look at dissociated mechanics is as one possible answer to the question 'why didn't some people like 4E?'. It is the Alexandrian school of thought on the subject. And it resonated because the people who didn't liked it nodded their heads when he coined that term (again myself included).                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_480336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480336/#Comment_480336" name="Item_205" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-02-12T12:10:34+00:00" title="February 12, 2019 12:10PM">February 12</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" rel="nofollow">Deliverator</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Yeah, I was never really bothered by the "once per encounter" / "once per day" stuff in 4E.

Also some of the individual powers felt kind of off to me. One final thing as well was the overall tone and style of the DMG. I only read it once, and I realize it has been re-examined over the years. But my first impression was that my approach to play was not particularly well regarded. That said, my business partner at the time, Bill Butler, who was as traditional as it gets, loved 4E. He had some quibbles (the ability where you essentially shout people back to health always bothered him for example) but he took the system and used to run it in a way that wasn't how I imagined it being run based on my reading of the books. So I do think what you did with the system mattered a lot. I was just never able to get passed the powers structure and the overall vibe of the game.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_480344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480344/#Comment_480344" name="Item_206" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-02-12T16:55:02+00:00" title="February 12, 2019  4:55PM">February 12</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 12, 2019 8:19PM by David_Berg.">edited February 12</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            FWIW, my two cents on <b>Fictional Positioning</b>:<br/><br/>"Positioning" in a game means that your options depend on your current game state.  You may have different options depending on whether you are:<br/>- winning or losing<br/>- on a red square or a green square<br/>- holding enough tokens to buy the card you drew<br/>- at the end of your allotted time<br/>etc.<br/><br/>"Fictional positioning" refers that portion of the player's game state which is defined by the character's fictional state.  You may have different options depending on whether your character is:<br/>- alert or distracted<br/>- 2 feet or 4 feet or 15 feet or 100 feet from their opponent<br/>- holding weapons<br/>- fully healthy<br/>- in possession of memorized spells<br/>- behind cover<br/>- inside the castle<br/>- really strong<br/>- really short<br/>- liked by this NPC<br/>- higher in rank than this NPC<br/>- backed by the Realm<br/>etc.<br/><br/>Some RPGs/groups focus on defining fictional positioning first, and deriving all player options from that.  <i>(Let's talk through the fictional lighting and terrain and guard situation until we can determine if sneaking into this castle is easy, impossible, a matter of skill, or a matter of luck, based on the fictional specifics.)</i><br/><br/>Other RPGs/groups use abstractions to approximate certain kinds of fictional positioning, with some player options derived from those abstractions.  <i>(We haven't talked through it in much detail, but we know that the fiction contains a guarded castle, and that my character is very stealthy.  Given that rough fictional positioning, the presence of a Stealth score on my character sheet leads me to believe that I can roll with that score to attempt to get my character past the guards and into the castle.)</i><br/><br/>Typically, RPGs/groups provide combinations of the above, where the rough fictional positioning and the game's system combine to indicate one set of player options, but sometimes the GM will add or remove some options by further specifying relevant fictional details.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_480345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480345/#Comment_480345" name="Item_207" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-02-12T17:01:21+00:00" title="February 12, 2019  5:01PM">February 12</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>How fictional positioning is established</i> is, to me, a separate topic.<br/><br/>Brendan, my best guess re: your experience is that the term "fictional positioning" happens to have caught on among folks who like the technique of metagame negotiation.

There are also Gamist reasons not to allow that, obviously.</p></div></blockquote>\nExactly. Although, I think it should be pointed out that, contrary to what has been written on the topic, martial daily powers in 4E absolutely are tied in to the fiction of the game's setting. They are first described in the pre-release <i>Races and Classes</i> book and are given their fullest explanation in <i>Martial Power 2</i>. Of course, one is free to conclude the fictional explanations provided are incoherent but I would offer they are no more incoherent than the idea that the cleric negotiates with his or her deity every morning exactly how many and which divine interventions ("Okay, Jesus, today I really need three Cure Light Wounds and 1 Protection from Evil, ok?") he or she will have access to and that this process somehow falls 100% under the control of the cleric's player.<br/><br/>Really, though, the game is rife with X/day powers with no fictional explanation for how they work and why they are limited as such. Everything from the paladin's smites per day to the barbarian's rages to the monk's uses of stunning fist to a rogue's defensive roll abilities. The fact that 5E is absolutely chock full of these abilities and yet nary a word of "disassociation" has been tossed in its general direction is a strong indication that, from the very beginning, this has been nothing but a grandiose exercise in Special Pleading and dissociated is just a buzz word for "unfamiliar".<br/><br/>That being said, I have experienced the "disassociated" phenomena myself during play and not once did it ever during an "once per X" power. By far the most disassociated and boardgamey elements of D&amp;D are from its very fundamental chassis: initiative, the cyclical round-based structure of combat, hit points, and the general action economy are far more "immersion breaking" than any of the special abilities or traits characters have the in the game. They remind you very loud and clear that this is a wargame-turned-RPG.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" rel="nofollow">Deliverator</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>1) Skill use and skill challenges often felt quite dissociated / had weak fictional positioning.

There is no reason "I diplomacize the NPC" would be a tenable action declaration during a skill challenge than during any skill check from any edition of D&amp;D.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" rel="nofollow">Deliverator</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>2) (Off-topic-ish.)

The world does not "level up" with the players, instead leveling is just another pacing mechanism that gives access to new fictional content in the game. This is quite significant in 4E, which has far more themetically coherent and fictionally charged content than other modern iterations of D&amp;D. If a 25th level character faces a simple wooden door, they don't have the same chance of breaking it open that they did at 1st level  --- it should be color or perhaps difficult terrain, if even that.<br/><br/>The DC-by-level chart is largely intended to interface with the skill challenge system, which assumes multiple characters will be participating during significant non-combat dramatic scenes (as opposed to other iterations of D&amp;D, which generally relegate such challenges to a single character). Because of that, it is important to have a degree of predictability and mathematical tightness when constructing non-combat challenges (which, unlike 5E, are just as significant to XP acquisition and the "encounters per day" guidelines as combat).<br/><br/>I saw your thoughts on this at rpg.net and I do agree that the half-tier implementation is a good idea, but its also something already found implicitly within 4E's design structure. Prior to Essentials, the DC-by-level table was organized in 3-level clumps (pretty close to a half-tier already) and the XP curves for monsters assumes that roughly every 4 to 5 levels a solo downgrades to an elite and an elite downgrades to a standard monster (it takes 8 levels for a standard to downgrade to a minion, sadly, but there's that).<br/><br/>~ Trent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481319/#Comment_481319" name="Item_210" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-26T10:41:43+00:00" title="March 26, 2019 10:41AM">March 26</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I know the whole round cow thing from Alexandrian was a hit job on 4e and on story gaming but\u2026 he did have a point.

I've certainly experienced no more "disassociation" in 4E than any other RPG I've played or run. I mean, there's the regular run-of-the-mill D&amp;D gamey stuff like hit points (although 4E has more cloud-pointing arrows here than other versions of D&amp;D because of the bloodied condition) and classes and levels and such, but none of that is particular to 4E.<br/><br/>Although, the entire Disassociated Mechanics trope is pretty much a case study in cognitive dissonance and special pleading, so there's that too. <br/><br/>I think you are perhaps conflating three distinct issues here: 1) Disassociated Mechanics, 2) Vincent's Clouds-and-Boxes stuff, and 3) Actor Stance vs Director Stance.

But if I instead see the SIS as separate from the representation I get frustrated af with the 4E.<br/><br/>Opening the PHB1 just now\u2026 almost every single power give me that vibe.<br/>This is the first page of powers in the book (cleric is the first class):<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://idiomdrottning.org/cleric-41-l1.png"/><br/><br/>Every single one of those powers (Healing Strike being the clearest example) give me the vibe of "it's not really\u2026 ME doing this\u2026"<br/><br/>To me they're all \u2190 arrows.  <br/>Nothing in the SIS triggered these things.<br/><br/>1. I, the player, decide to engage with mechanic.<br/>2.This leads to PC saying prayer, and to a canned cutscene of divine radiance gleaming from PC's weapon, enemy being smoted, and my deity bestowing a minor blessing in the form of healing for you or one of your allies.<br/>3. Except the target isn't really smitified, only marked and hit with 2[W] (which, granted, might kill it)<br/>4. And then we need to check the dice world \u2014 not the SIS \u2014 to see if my friend is close enough (in terms of squares) to be healed.<br/><br/>What's lacking for me is interaction with the situation. These consequences were initiated in the dice world and all stemmed from the dice world.<br/><br/>Now, not every mechanic need to have both directions of arrows. As long as there is a good mix of both directions overall. For me I get the vibe that these mechanics start in the dice world and then launch a barrage of unidirectional \u2190 arrows.<br/><br/>Again, subtle design cues like names, flavor text (or lack of flavor text) etc cause this feeling.

(Wonder if that means that if 4e had been the game there would\u2019ve been no anti-D&amp;D panic in the 80s.)</p><p>It\u2019s to a large extent a manner of presentation and phrasing.

Here's my take on things:<br/><br/>The term "Disassociated Mechanics": This was quite clearly a hit job on 4E and a fairly transparent one at that. D&amp;D has always had what we might call "disassociated mechanics" --- everything from hit points to spell slots to classes to levels to turns to rounds to the action economy --- in fact you could argue that the vast majority of D&amp;D's rules architecture is "disassociated mechanics". The fact that 4E's specific mechanics were singled out here AND the fact that nearly identical mechanics in 5E have not been singled out by the same communities by and large shows it was a thinly-veiled attempt to elevate one's preferences to a reified status. <br/><br/>4E's Powers and the SIS: You're missing a lot of context here as well as misrepresenting Vincent's position in his articles (as an example, "when your character attacks mine, roll dice" is not meaningfully different from "when I cast my lance of faith prayer, I roll dice" --- both "attacks" and "lance of faith" are things that exist in the SIS). I know some of this is due to your lack of familiarity with 4E, but it absolutely has the equivalent of spell components in its power framework: power sources and keywords.  The fact that those Cleric powers are called prayers, the fact they all have the divine keyword, the weapon keyword, the implement keyword, or the radiant keyword absolutely *means something* in the fiction. It is tied into 4E's presumed setting and other fictional interactions. Keywords are 4E's version of fictional triggers (as well as more mundane things like range).<br/><br/>The battlemap: I'm strongly with <a href="/forums/profile/Khimus">@Khimus</a> here. This is clearly a representation of what's going on in the fiction. To use your terminology, the map is not the territory.<br/><br/>- Trent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481381/#Comment_481381" name="Item_221" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-27T23:20:14+00:00" title="March 27, 2019 11:20PM">March 27</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2019 11:25PM by 2097.">edited March 27</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" rel="nofollow">Trent_W</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The term \u201cDisassociated Mechanics\u201d: This was quite clearly a hit job on 4E and a fairly transparent one at that.

And yet no one can actually agree on what it "evidently" is, or how it could be defined in any clear way.<br/><br/>It's more about how something "feels", fundamentally, kind of like the word "romantic". Or like pornography, perhaps. You can't really define it, but, darn it, you know it when you see it!<br/><br/>For instance, I find it hilarious to think that either 4E (for Trent, perhaps) or 5e (for Sandra) could feel even remotely associated, but I do remember playing a lot of 2nd Edition (AD&amp;D) back in my youth, and it felt more "real" than other games, simply due to familiarity.<br/><br/>I think Sandra's analogies about the "map and the territory" here are correct; we can learn to see certain elements as familiar enough that we automatically "translate" them into fiction at the table, so that the map and the territory become one. And yet, how much and how little is utterly personal and individual (and can change over time - I certainly wouldn't feel the way I did as a teenager if I were to play 2nd Ed D&amp;D now, for instance).<br/><br/>It's really cool to see how much effort Sandra puts into those elements "feeling right" (the line-by-line equipment "luggage game" is a wonderful example!), even when (as she admits) most of the things are highly "dissociated" by anyone's definition - everything from the luggage game to the monster decision matrix as well as basic D&amp;D ideas like hit points, classes, and levels).<br/><br/>I think that shows love for the hobby and a fanatical devotion to detail - always a fundamental part of evolving any hobby or art to a higher level. Lovely!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481387/#Comment_481387" name="Item_223" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-28T03:37:56+00:00" title="March 28, 2019  3:37AM">March 28</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a few other comments after thinking about this for a while:<br/><br/>1. I think that the aspect of "dissociated" that everyone can relate to comes down to something like one of these two things:<br/><br/>a) "I'm playing this game, and I know what I - as my character - want to do! But, wait... apparently I can't just do that. I have to ignore those instincts and turn to the rules, instead: they say it's not one of my available options. Damn: the game just got more frustrating and less fun for me."<br/><br/>(Note that this is very common whenever you first play a new game: whether it's accepting that you can't narrate actions on behalf of other characters, that you have to get used to being overruled by the judgement of the GM, or that you have to obey turn-order in combat, those are constraints informed by the rules of the game. It can happen later in play, too: let's say you're playing D&amp;D, and you decide your character is too scared of the dungeon and wants to go home, instead. Sounds reasonable... but it's not a valid option in the game - at least not usually, not in most D&amp;D games. Same goes for your wizard who's not allowed to pick up a sword and use it, or similar restrictions we eventually learn to internalize and maybe even rationalize within the fiction. Next time you play with newbies, watch them struggle with these things! Most people catch on quickly, though.)<br/><br/>b) "We're going through this rules procedure or rolling these dice... and I have no idea how to translate that into the vivid fiction in my head. What does it mean? What does it look like?"<br/><br/>You're taken out of the fiction for a moment, and left scratching your head. (That is, unless you're familiar enough with that process - like marking XP after defeating a monster or completing a Milestone, or marking off Inspiration - that it doesn't distract you anymore.)<br/><br/>I agree that these are problems, and worth keeping in mind as a designer. I DO think that D&amp;D 4E seems to have a lot more of those "sticking points" than many other RPGs, at least for some people, but I don't think we'd all agree on where those are.<br/><br/>2. My other issue with the term "dissociated" is that it implies or assumes that "associated" is better. <br/><br/>Look at any discussion of the term by someone who finds it useful, and you'll find that assumption at least strongly implied in their words.<br/><br/>I think association is *desirable* in the abstract, sure, but I don't think we should assume that it's "better". (Even if and when we agree on what it is!)<br/><br/>I would never have thought this is a younger gamer, but after many years I've seen far too many examples of entirely "dissociated" rules making for better, smoother, more fun (and sometimes even "more immersive") gameplay. Far too many.<br/><br/>I think Sandra is experiencing this with a lot of her "funny" rules mods (like the luggage game) which are contributing to her having more fun at the table and more consistently enjoyable games.<br/><br/>It's not as simple as "dissociated = bad" and "associated = good", because we're dealing with abstractions and practicality and familiarity, all which are tradeoffs in various directions and they all affect each other in unpredictable ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481391/#Comment_481391" name="Item_224" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-28T06:08:30+00:00" title="March 28, 2019  6:08AM">March 28</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seems like that just means dissociated = bad but there are other dimensions and maybe dissociated + quick + cheap = good, but then still associated + quick + cheap &gt; dissociated + quick + cheap.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481392/#Comment_481392" name="Item_225" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-28T06:30:05+00:00" title="March 28, 2019  6:30AM">March 28</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, thank you;<br/>I want to add to your A and B a third option, a C, where\u2026 it feels like the presentation of a mechanic kicks me into another stance. It's an "out of body"-experience where the character asserts herself to be truly distant from me. I do believe that this is one of those "sharp corner that gets sanded down over time" things, where after a while maybe you're over the presentation and it does start like you using those powers again and not just you "watching them do it".<br/><br/>Guy, I think you're on to something. Usually a dissociated mechanic have plenty of things in the pro-column that made it a worthwhile inclusion. I mean let's take Fiasco where you draft the elements that's going to be part of the game. "Element drafting" isn't associated with anything in the real world. It's still a mechanic that's worth having in the game..<br/><br/>I <i>do</i> have sympathy with Trent for having a distaste for a particular phrase, it's like with me when people have been trying to reclaim the world "railroading" and turn it into something more value neutral, it took a while for me to warm up to that. I'm def not denying the hit job origins of the phrase.<br/><br/>Overall I have to admit that I do agree with many Alexandrian's brutal criticisms of 4e, but Trent is right that other D&amp;D mechanics, such as the six-second round (or one minute round in some editions) might be in a bit of a glass house in that regard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" title="Trent_W"><img alt="Trent_W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W">Trent_W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481401/#Comment_481401" name="Item_226" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-28T14:00:50+00:00" title="March 28, 2019  2:00PM">March 28</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>You\u2019re absolutely right that the Alexandrian missed these, or gave undue allowance to them because they were grandfathered in due to their history with D&amp;D.</p><p>But 4e introducing a whole <em>new</em> slew of these is what caused the term to come into existence.</p></div></blockquote>\nWhich is precisely the point I've been making since the start of this thread. Its not that 4E was *disassociated* (whatever one wants that to mean, we've already seen multiple interpretations in this thread alone) but that 4E was *unfamiliar*. From the very beginning, "disassociated mechanics" tells us next to nothing meaningful about game design but tells us quite a bit about the prejudices, biases, and comfort zone of the person using the term (not unlike the term "immersion" as <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> pointed out). I think this is related to some of Ron Edwards' recent observations on how Dungeons &amp; Dragons is basically something of a folk religion to a lot of people (so 4E wasn't merely making something different it was actually committing blasphemy in many people's eyes). <br/><br/>I mean, for crying out loud, if the very fundamental resolution mechanics and character components in the game are "disassociated" (as many including yourself have already admitted) does anyone really have a leg to stand on here?\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>As you see in my posts in this thread, I\u2019ve been more than willing to concede to you that 5e does have dissociated mechanics and that, as DeReel pointed out, I\u2019ve been putting efforts in to associate them again. Even going as far as saying \u201cHit points exist in the world\u201d.</p></div></blockquote>\nSure, but as I pointed out almost all discussion about "disassociated mechanics" evaporated when 5E came out --- despite the fact it shares many of those self-same mechanics with 4E. This speaks volumes.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>Yes, and I <em>do</em> appreciate that, but</p><ol><li>it\u2019s not written in the language the characters would use, and</li><li>the way it\u2019s presented with the little flavor text really takes me out of it.</li></ol></div></blockquote>\nI don't dispute what you write here (although I *would* argue that the vast majority of D&amp;D mechanics are "not written in the language the characters would use"), but my point was that powers like Lance of Faith absolutely do have arrows flowing both ways. The SIS isn't exclusively a first-person space but encompasses third-person perspectives as well.<br/><br/>The larger point I was making is 4E's fictional triggers (namely, keywords) may be different than some other iterations of D&amp;D, but they are still fictional triggers nonetheless. In many ways, 4E's keywords are actually quite analogous to AW's tags.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>What I\u2019m saying is that I\u2019ve had three different experiences with maps&amp;minis RPGs.</p><ol><li>I see the map as the territory and really get <em>invested</em> in the little dolls.

After years of running 4E, we got sick of counting squares and bounced hard into 13th Age. Its particular take on TotM was totally a breath of fresh air for my players. Of course, the absolute best combat I ever had in 13A was basically breaking out a map and putting everything into visual zones like FATE or the new Conan RPG so make of that what you will.<br/><br/>The current 4E game I'm running for my wife was largely TotM for the first few sessions and I experimented with a homebrew zone-based system for one session, as well. My wife wanted to try the battlegrid out, though, and for her it just *clicked*. It actually enhanced her immersion rather than damaging it. Some people just need that visual representation and purely verbal description just won't cut it. <br/><br/>As for me, I think I generally prefer mapless play (which is why my non-setpiece combats are all run as skill challenges) but it is really really hard to do interesting, complex combats with unique terrain features that way. So for dramatic setpiece encounters we bust out the battlemap, otherwise its 100% TotM. Different tools for different jobs, right?<br/><br/>Trent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481402/#Comment_481402" name="Item_227" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-28T14:40:42+00:00" title="March 28, 2019  2:40PM">March 28</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 28, 2019 3:16PM by Hopeless_Wanderer.">edited March 28</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>It's not as simple as "dissociated = bad" and "associated = good", because we're dealing with abstractions and practicality and familiarity, all which are tradeoffs in various directions and they all affect each other in unpredictable ways.</p></div></blockquote>\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> Despite what you say being true in theory; in practice, any native-speaker and many of our talented second-language speakers of English, here, know implicitly that the morpheme {dis-} means "away from", or "having a negative, or reversing force", e.g. <i>disconnect</i>, <i>disagree</i>, <i><b>distrust</b></i>, <i><b>disapprove</b></i>, <i><b>dislike</b></i>, <i><b>disrupt</b></i>, <i>disallow</i>, and <i>discolour</i>. So <i>dissociated</i> is not a neutral term--it's use in this agrument is prejudical. Language matters. <br/><br/>At the top of this thread there were people vociferously complaining about the use of this term (and what they saw as the not-so-hidden agenda behind it), but they seem to have been by-passed. Since then, a fiddly, comparative argument between lumpers and splitters has ensued trying to get around the fact that that the term and perhaps the concept itself is essentially flawed.  <br/><br/>I don't think that you can wipe the discursive slate clean by abstracting a term away from it's pejorative meaning, or by attempting to re-define it, or managing its negative implications. Language doesn't (usually) work like that unless there are powerful political forces and big media budgets behind it. And it never works like that at the morphemic level. Sometimes a word can be reclaimed by a community, but I don't think that is the case here. Speaker, intention, place, time, etc. all bring traces that can't be ignored.<br/> <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481403/#Comment_481403" name="Item_228" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-28T14:45:21+00:00" title="March 28, 2019  2:45PM">March 28</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" rel="nofollow">Trent_W</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I mean, for crying out loud, if the very fundamental resolution mechanics and character components in the game are \u201cdisassociated\u201d (as many including yourself have already admitted) does anyone really have a leg to stand on here?</p></div></blockquote><p>So there has been confusion, on my own part admittedly, between dissociated (please stop calling it disassociated \u2013 maybe that\u2019s why you are provoked? disassociated would be a horrible thing to call a mechanic. it\u2019s dissociated) and just abstracted.</p><p>Dissociated mechanics are a\u2026 subset of abstracted?

We all know about the phenomenon of "lonely fun" when it comes to RPG books, yeah? You know, where people read an RPG rulebook for pleasure or inspiration or get a feel for the fiction of the game, right? Well, most of the 4E books (especially prior to the Essentials re-formatting) are very clearly not trying to do that. They are first and foremost reference books and are 100% written with that purpose in mind: trying to communicate to the reader how to use a particular rule element (usually a power or a statblock) as precisely and concisely as possible. <br/><br/>As a concrete example of what I'm talking about, compare the information you need to run a Mummy Lord in 3E vs 4E vs 5E: <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/457962153966567446/536763667631570944/dnd_3p5_to_4_to_5_01.png" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/457962153966567446/536763667631570944/dnd_3p5_to_4_to_5_01.png</a> . The 4E version is insanely simpler, more accessible, and more concise and that's pretty representative of the game's design as a whole.<br/><br/>So, that's something to keep in mind here: the 4E rules are not the game itself, they are reference materials for the game. And, those reference materials go out of their way to be as brief, explicit, and unambiguous as possible. Other versions of D&amp;D will usually have a paragraph or two accompanying the Fireball spell explaining how it combusts things around it and sets aflame flammable objects and various other "by the way, this makes fire" information. 4E communicates the exact same thing by simply giving it the fire keyword and having the spell do fire damage. Its three words of text vs three paragraphs of text.<br/><br/>There are a lot of emergent properties in the 4E game itself that are not obvious from its reference materials, including how they interact to create new fiction. This is something to keep in mind when reading a power or statblock.<br/><br/>Trent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481432/#Comment_481432" name="Item_242" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-29T13:50:10+00:00" title="March 29, 2019  1:50PM">March 29</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Love that 5e mummy lord so much\u2665\u2665\u2665<br/>Spellcaster monsters were such a headache when I first started running and it took a while for them to become my absolute faves.

Good times. <img alt=":dizzy:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/dizzy.png" title=":dizzy:"/> <br/><br/>Also, to be clear, I'm not provoked by the term or anything like that. I just think that the Alexandrian's original argument and the way it has been used by online communities since then has largely been nonsense and pretty much textbook examples of Special Pleading. <br/><br/>As to your question about dissociated vs abstract mechanics, yeah, that's the issue isn't it? The example Justin seemed to want to use over and over was the Rogue's Trick Strike daily power. The objection being that daily abilities don't "make sense" for martial heroes (even though classes like the Kensai have had X/day abilities since 1E), but that's a very different thing from saying that Trick Strike doesn't exist in the fiction or you can't inhabit a first-person perspective while using Trick Strike. I mean, near as I can tell the real argument here is basically "I don't like the fiction, therefore the fiction must not exist" or something. Its weird.<br/><br/>That's why I don't think association is a useful way of framing game mechanics. It conflates and confuses so many different real meaningful concepts --- Actor Stance vs Fictional Positioning vs Abstract Mechanics --- that its not really helpful. That it has historically been used to accuse certain games of being Not Real Roleplaying is just icing on the cake here.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>So what are the things coming from the \u201ccloud\u201d world when using, well, I said Healing Strike was a much clearer example than Lance of Faith and of course Come And Get It is the poster child so that\u2019d be the clearest example of all?</p></div></blockquote>\nI don't have my 4E books with me, so I'll tackle Healing Strike since you printed it upthread. <br/><br/>So, it has the following relevant keywords: Melee, Weapon, Divine, Healing, Radiant.

I mean, everything from the early adventures to lackluster magic items to pre-MM3 monster math to feat taxes to the potency of multi-hit powers to skill challenge DCs to overemphasis on alpha strike rounds. Of course, a considerable number of these things were corrected or improved upon as the edition developed but that's neither here nor there. Speaking of myself, I modify or house rule many things in my own 4E games (we currently don't use magic items or feats, for example) so its not like I hold the rules as written as sacrosanct.<br/><br/>I would add though, that its important to distinguish between those legitimate criticisms and bullshit criticisms. Things like there is no fictional positioning in 4E (which is not true) or it has nothing but combat (laughable given the existence of skill challenges, rituals, and quest xp) or warlords yell people's arms back on or its an MMO on paper are clearly nonsense and not informed by any kind of meaningful experience with the game.<br/><br/>Trent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" title="Trent_W"><img alt="Trent_W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W">Trent_W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481440/#Comment_481440" name="Item_245" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-29T19:48:26+00:00" title="March 29, 2019  7:48PM">March 29</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Oh, that means that I misunderstood another thing about your position, Trent, I thought you also wanted to throw out stance theory.

I do think games like 4E mesh a bit better with director stance than actor stance, but the idea that its impossible to inhabit actor stance when using a power (as the Alexandrian article seemed to suggest with Trick Strike) is clearly absurd.<br/><br/>Trent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481441/#Comment_481441" name="Item_246" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-29T21:31:38+00:00" title="March 29, 2019  9:31PM">March 29</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 29, 2019 9:58PM by 2097.">edited March 29</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>So I think what the Alexandrian, in his 2012 followup at least, was trying to say was that some mechanics favor what I\u2019ve called <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21094/stance-glossary/p1" rel="nofollow">identifying stance</a> and some favor pawn stance or other detached stances.</p><p>This has been an observation I\u2019ve gotten tons of mileage out when designing.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481443/#Comment_481443" name="Item_247" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-29T23:58:55+00:00" title="March 29, 2019 11:58PM">March 29</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 30, 2019 12:05AM by Paul_T.">edited March 30</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to cover a lot quickly!

Are you suggesting that RPGs would be better if they didn't have "dissociated mechanics"? Given that the vast majority (maybe all?) RPGs have such mechanics, would excising them immediately improve all our games?<br/><br/>For instance, is D&amp;D more fun if we remove Experience Points and Leveling? (Let's imagine a new version of D&amp;D where we replace them with something that's easier to parse in "actor stance", like getting "training points" for spending X hours of study on a particular skill. Is that version of D&amp;D more fun to play?)<br/><br/>It seems entirely uncontroversial to me.<br/><br/>But maybe I'm misunderstanding what you've written!<br/><br/>3. I really like Sandra's "Three Versions" of how someone can interact with and react to a map with minis. I think it's very insightful!<br/><br/>This is also where I get off the bus with this whole discussion: as we're seeing, even just from that very specific example, every person's intuitive reaction and parsing of a thing is different. It's a subjective experience, much like "immersion". For instance, it might help <i>me</i> to imagine a scene if I see a diagram of the layout, and I'm confused otherwise, because I suck at parsing verbal descriptions (let's say). But it might distract <i>you</i> from the fiction to see that same diagram, because you're now staring at a piece of paper instead of imagining the water dripping from the ceiling. Well, we're different, right?<br/><br/>That's why I think this whole line of argument is pretty flawed. This whole "dissociated" business depends not just on each person's personal biases, but also on the group's attitude and how any given rule is used. How do we present these things to each other when we play? For example, are distances on our battlemap sacrosanct (you can get out a ruler and check your crossbow's range), or agreed to be approximations, where we will just slide miniatures around when something doesn't match what we're imagining? Two different games...<br/><br/>I don't think it makes sense to label rules "dissociated" or not when a given player can be given an explanation or an example of something, and, within 2-3 minutes, go from seeing a rule they previously saw as "dissociated" as "associated" (or vice-versa!). I have another example of this below...<br/><br/>I get much more mileage out of my two "problem cases", as I outlined above: when does this actually become a sticking point in play? At those moments.<br/><br/>4. D&amp;D4 versus other editions.<br/><br/>I don't have a good argument here, because I've actually never played D&amp;D4. (Which maybe means I should shut up as far as this part of the discussion is concerned! That wouldn't be unfair. Take everything I say here with a grain of salt, please.)<br/><br/>However, here's my general experience: everyone I know who has played it has made a comment somewhat along the lines of, "It was great! But we just stopped roleplaying and enjoyed it like a boardgame."<br/><br/>Many of these people were not in any way prejudiced against the game (some were playtesters when it was coming out, and very excited about it!).<br/><br/>Why does that happen? (An honest question; I have no idea!)<br/><br/>The examples being used in this thread from 4E are interesting. And I think they further illustrate how subjective and personal this is, and how tied in to other things (even cultural referents!) this whole issue is.<br/><br/>Let's take that Healing Strike:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" rel="nofollow">Trent_W</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>I don't have my 4E books with me, so I'll tackle Healing Strike since you printed it upthread. <br/><br/>So, it has the following relevant keywords: Melee, Weapon, Divine, Healing, Radiant. That actually tells us quite a bit about the fiction of the power: The Cleric is positioned within 5 to 10 feet of their enemy, channels divine power (connected to the Astral Setting in the implied mythical setting) through their melee weapon to smite them holy energy while simultaneously channeling restorative healing energy to someone within 25 feet.<br/><br/>That seems pretty straightforward fictional positioning to me, no? <br/></p></div></blockquote>\nIt does, in many ways, doesn't it?<br/><br/>However, for me, at least, it's missing some fictional referent. What is actually happening here, and why? What else can the cleric do with this, for example?<br/><br/>When I see "cast a Fireball at your enemies", or "cleave through minor foes", for instance, I have a clear sense of what that is in fiction. I've seen that happen in fantasy stories, right? So many times!<br/><br/>But this "Healing Strike" is foreign to me. I don't really understand what's happening there, what it means, or its implications. I've never seen Conan or Gandalf do that.<br/><br/>Based on rumours I've heard [rumours: the best information source, clearly!], I would assume that it's something coming from MMORPGs. Somehow I can imagine that happening on a computer screen, with flashing lights and sound effects. HP totals change and figures flash or shimmer and BAM!<br/><br/>Where did I get this idea? I'm not sure. Is it correct? Is there a fictional referent of some sort?<br/><br/>Now, lots and lots of D&amp;D rules are like this (down to the classic example of Gandalf, in old-school D&amp;D, not being allowed to use his sword). I don't see this as in any way specific to D&amp;D4. But my assumption all along has been that this kind of thing quite consciously got brought in from MMORPGs.<br/><br/>I have no idea if I'm right, though! Nor do I know whether D&amp;D4 has more stuff like this than other editions. It's just the reputation! <br/><br/>That shows, I think, how the whole concept of "dissociated" is rather fragile. After all, let's imagine that, instead of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, I'd just read some awesome fantasy novel which illustrates in beautiful and inspiring ways how clerics smiting their enemies heals nearby allies. <i>Now</i> I would read the Healing Strike rule and grin and rub my hands, because this is exactly what I've been imagining, and it reeks with purpose and inspiring imagery, and I can't wait to play. It's vivid in my head and using it makes total sense!<br/><br/>And that, to me, shows that it's not (or not only) about game design, which is why this is such a complex topic to handle. It's the same reason Sandra isn't bothered by HP and AC and XP, but finds use a battlemap takes her out of the "realness" of the game. <br/><br/>Right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481449/#Comment_481449" name="Item_248" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-30T06:36:11+00:00" title="March 30, 2019  6:36AM">March 30</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 30, 2019 6:39AM by DeReel.">edited March 30</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To clarify my brief and obscure post : <br/>1) Talking linguistics seemed like hair splitting. <br/>2) The intent in OP was to form this new concept with an old word.

But making decisions with XP in mind is making desicions based on extrinsic factors. Now, some games like ACKS put in effort to tie XP to political power and/or wealth. Associating it (in a convoluted way). Or you can cook up something like it represents training \u2013 who wouldn\u2019t want to become more experienced (not necessarily stoned, but beautiful)? Similarly, the limitations on EDU powers can be framed as the character\u2019s fatigue, or as semantics like \u201cthey can only do their <strong>best</strong> effort once, anything you can do more than once is by definition not the strictly, unmatched best\u201d.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shimrod" title="shimrod"><img alt="shimrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shimrod">shimrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481453/#Comment_481453" name="Item_250" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-30T12:18:02+00:00" title="March 30, 2019 12:18PM">March 30</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>HP and AC are associated mechanics that <em>does</em> concern the character <em>intrinsically</em>.

I don't think it's such a strange idea to have daily powers, for gamers that watch anime or superheroes movies. Even in videogames, we've come to accept that certain important feats can be accomplished limited times, for any reason (they're exhausting, for example). And those are as good genre rules as "you pull incredible feats out of luck". Remember we're dealing with fiction, and thus there are many genres, many explanations for how power, health, luck, advancement, might work.<br/>In many OSR text, I feel they refer to one and only sense of verisimilitude as valid, which would be a notion of realism + D&amp;D rules. I think it's harmful to work with only one notion of verisimilitude.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481457/#Comment_481457" name="Item_254" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-30T18:50:54+00:00" title="March 30, 2019  6:50PM">March 30</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 30, 2019 6:57PM by EmmatheExcrucian.">edited March 30</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd argue it's also harmful to demand verisimilitude from all genres across the board as well, because there's a lot of great stuff out there that eschews the concept entirely. <br/><br/>I should also note - when I played 4e, I felt exactly the opposite about AEDU than a lot of the stances being expressed in this thread.

Everyone stacked weird complicated stuff to such a degree that turns took so long that I had long checked out by the time my turn came around (especially with how generally meaningless positioning was in that edition). It left me so checked out theoy everything went into pawn stance whenever combat started. All of my abilities felt like they were just variations on the same thing that I was commanding my character to do and then it didn't really matter in the long run because I didn't have the complex, over-powered build that was going to end the encounter. <br/>Without any kind of built-in dramatic pacing, encounters also felt so full of dead space so most turns felt wasted until the one that wasted all the enemies.<br/>5e felt much the same when I tried it, except in 5e I felt like I had no abilities and no real way to get more. It was all just basic attacks because I could cast like twice ever before having to go to basic attacks. <br/>4e mitigated this by making me actually have useful abilities, making the characters balanced, giving everyone concrete party roles to fill, and building in dramatic pacing.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481466/#Comment_481466" name="Item_258" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-31T07:38:20+00:00" title="March 31, 2019  7:38AM">March 31</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Thank you for giving details, much appreciated!

All of 4e's Wizard At-Wills for instance are built around its identity as a Control class. They control movement on a big level, and with how focused class design is in 4e, all the abilities work together towards one end. <br/>Whereas like, in 5e or 3.5 for instance, there's a bunch of spells that work towards one goal, then a bunch that work towards a different one, and more that work towards a third one, etc. A wizard isn't just Control, it can also be like DPS and probably something else. I don't know 5e wizards very well. I just know that 5e's classes aren't hyper-focused the way that 4e's were. So like, in 5e or 3.5, I could theoretically end up with spell picks that don't synergize and kind of end up with my character as a useless blob who can't do anything right. (I'm kind of bad at builds, so this happened to me <i>constantly </i>when I played 3.5 and also happened to me with the characters I built in 5e). Whereas like, in 4e, no matter which spells I pick, I'm going to be good at Control, because it's the class's total thing. If I pick really optimally, I might be centering around being really good at a specific effect or something, but you can't build a 4e Wizard who's bad at control. You can't build a 4e Wizard who's that useless blob who can't do anything right, which makes each character feel more complete to me. They have a core thing and no matter what they're good at doing it. I have something useful to do, because in a properly balanced party, I'm the only Controller if I'm playing a Wizard (and if someone else decides to play a Controller for some reason, it's probably going to do something really different as far as how it implements, and we're going to synergize with each other really well). My actions actually matter in combat, because I'm mechanically a valuable member of the party instead of being the useless blob who might as well just stay at home.<br/><br/>Another problem I had with 3.5 and 5e that contributed to the useless blob feeling is how important all the stats are, or rather how important a few core ones are, which 4e didn't really do. 4e makes HP be derived from Con Score + Class-Based Number instead of Number + Con Modifier, and then after Level 1, you never do anything with Con modifying your HP, other than your HP going up by a couple of points if you increase your Con. It's the difference between say an 8 Con character having 50 HP at level 5 and 12 HP at level 5 (My numbers there are probably off. It's been a couple of years since I looked at either game). In 5e (and 3.5) having low Con is a ludicrous handicap. It means I have to play really well or die, whereas in 4e, it just means I have less HP but still as many as I plausibly need. So then in 5e/3.5, Con becomes kind of a tax unless you remove death mechanics. The same goes with how 3.5 took saves and AC from one stat each, whereas 4e does it from two. AC comes from either Int or Dex. Fort comes from either Con or Wis. So then it's not such a big tax to have good saves or defenses or whatever, because say you're playing a Wizard and have shitty Con, you can draw your Fort defense from Wis, which is probably high for you, since Wizards use Wis as an important secondary stat. I'm not a useless blob because I dumped Con, because I still have decent HP and decent Fort (just not as good as I could theoretically have)! I'm not going to die from a single hit because I dumped Con because I conceptually wanted to roleplay a sickly character! <br/>Basically, the way that 4e handles Stat to Defense/Save/Whatever allows you to make the character you want as far as ability scores (as long as you've focused the ones your class actively uses) without being handicapped horribly for it. I had a lot of trouble in 3.5 with picking stats a certain way for roleplay and then being screwed over for it. I'm not sure whether 5e does the thing with two stats to pick between for AC/Saves, but I don't remember it doing it when I tried it. I do distinctly remember the Con issue though, so it would follow that they made it one stat. <br/><br/>I'm rambling at this point though. I'm sorry for the absolutely gargantuan wall of text.<br/>Basically, a big part of what makes 4e not feel like useless blob character to me is that my class has a core identity that it's always good at, and that I'm going to be functional regardless of my stat picks (as long as I have good stats in the scores my class uses for its powers, of course). I suck at building, but I also hate dying, and in 4e I didn't die despite my shitty builds, even during the period before we dropped death mechanics from our play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481472/#Comment_481472" name="Item_264" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-31T09:48:22+00:00" title="March 31, 2019  9:48AM">March 31</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 31, 2019 9:58AM by 2097.">edited March 31</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" rel="nofollow">EmmatheExcrucian</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>It\u2019s really important to note that 4e\u2019s Magic Missile can be used as a ranged basic attack, which allows wizards to use it for Opportunity Attacks</p></div></blockquote><p>Ranged basic attacks can\u2019t be used for Opportunity attacks, only m\xeal\xe9e abilities can.

Until I read Jack Vance's Dying Earth stories. After that, I loved it.<br/><br/>This suggests to me that the dissociation isn't really a property of a game mechanic. The mechanics didn't change, and they went in a fairly discrete step from quite dissociated to not dissociated at all, for me, after I got a satisfying explanation.<br/><br/>It also suggests an explanation or rationalisation or description isn't enough. The explanation in the PHB didn't satisfy, even though it's pretty much the same information as in Vance. It's the quality of execution of the explanation: Vance's writing is engaging and inspiring, and now playing a wizard brings up associations (heh) of all the other things that happen in the stories as well, instead of a feeling that this works how it works because this is just a game.<br/><br/>I don't think the point of dissociation can be found looking at the mechanics for fireball vs. rogue feint. I think it's in the presentation, including historical and external to the game (presentation of fireball in the 4E books themselves is just as sparse as for the martial dailies).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481474/#Comment_481474" name="Item_266" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-31T15:11:00+00:00" title="March 31, 2019  3:11PM">March 31</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1, it supports Paul_T's argument about being inspired by previous exposure to, for instance, MMORPG, or Marvel or comix, or specific genres and tropes. D&amp;D rules lack a Barnum to cover all of its genre offsprings.<br/>That said, clever rules redaction (eg : not insisting on exact distances) and ad hoc setting facts (eg : Vancian magic) can mitigate this. I think Thanuir wanted to stress this latter aspect. <br/>Some RPGs are like board games for that matter : they've got a nice core mechanic, and select world facts to match it. I think of AW and MH this way : to make Hx and NPC interaction shine, you need a community with a limited number of actors. Post-apo and High-school provide that. Factions thrown into a walled city like crabs in a basket, goes nicely with faction (semi-closed) system in Blades. A story mechanic that enables some very abstract implementations of Theme : Dogs in the Vineyard has god and demons. I don't know if the setting came after the mechanics, but they certainly match. My take away is that it's always a good move to try and match mechanics with setting/colour. Which could be called "associating".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481475/#Comment_481475" name="Item_267" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-31T15:32:35+00:00" title="March 31, 2019  3:32PM">March 31</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's also an interesting idea:<br/><br/>Can "dissociated" refer to mechanics which don't match the fictional content of the game well? <br/><br/>For instance, if we take D&amp;D's mechanics and use them in our "modern-day office worker romance", do they pretty much all now become "dissociated mechanics"?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shimrod" title="shimrod"><img alt="shimrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shimrod">shimrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481479/#Comment_481479" name="Item_268" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-31T17:51:00+00:00" title="March 31, 2019  5:51PM">March 31</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The examples are so far apart I'm not sure I understand the suggestion?

I've never seen it happen at any 4E table I've been a part of so the answers I could give you would be pure speculation here. Also, from what I understand the playtest version of 4E varied significantly from the published version so there's that as well.<br/><br/>That being said, just as with any RPG and particularly complex RPGs, there is an art to doing 4E well and oftentimes people brought in assumptions from 3E or earlier iterations of D&amp;D that were not borne out in 4E's design ethos. This included writers at WotC who wrote most early 4E adventures like they were 3E adventures (the infamous Keep on the Shadowfell being the most well-known example).<br/><br/>I've actually noticed this pattern myself in my own games. If I run a published module or adventure path, it tends to feel a bit lifeless and "boardgamey" I suppose, but if I'm running my own stuff it feels more like we're doing 4E the way it was "supposed to be". Its a little hard to explain. I don't feel 4E as a system lends itself very well to the canned adventure path or module format and is really meant to be more of a player-driven, no-myth style of game. This is especially true if you look at the refinements and developments found in the DMG2 (which were largely abandoned with the Essentials re-formatting of the brand).<br/><br/>Trent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" title="Trent_W"><img alt="Trent_W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W">Trent_W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481502/#Comment_481502" name="Item_276" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-01T13:29:27+00:00" title="April  1, 2019  1:29PM">April 1</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>But it doesn\u2019t feel like <em>me</em> doing it.

I grew up watching anime and studying martial arts. Things You Can Do are just as real, associated, and first-person for me as Things You Have. In fact, I don't even experience any meaningful difference between the two. Whereas reducing all hand-to-hand combat maneuvers and positioning down to "I attack" is incredibly off-putting and will immediately strain my suspension of disbelief because it is so contrary to my first-hand experience of those realities.<br/><br/>Trent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481505/#Comment_481505" name="Item_277" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-01T14:33:13+00:00" title="April  1, 2019  2:33PM">April 1</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, you mean like a \u578b such as a \u6ce2\u52d5\u62f3, I've never thought of it that way.

Or other ways to introduce some sort of maneuvers or positioning. A couple of years ago I would've said that this is what advantage and disadvantage in 5e is for. That's why you flip over book cases or do other interesting moves. But in practice I have to admit that after a few sessions that sort of usage tends to fall of. My experience is that new players are AWESOME in that regard but once you've gotten used to the game you start to play more boringly and that's something I'm going to try to address.<br/><br/>But you know I also put in my own combat system with provoking the enemy, front ranks / back rank distinction, aerial maneuvers for flying fighters, reach weapons, moving around between different targets, opportunities, dodging vs going on the offense etc. However, I'm deliberately building it around predicates/qualities/locations rather than "canned actions".

Any trained fighter would tell you that you most certainly *are* choosing from a "menu of options" in combat, sometimes that choice is split-second or so unconscious it boils down to muscle memory, but your footwork, movements, and attacks undeniably resemble "canned maneuvers" that you have practiced hundreds if not thousands of times before (with the disclaimer that there are countless small variations for any given "canned maneuver"). <br/><br/>The reaction I saw from the community in regards to 4E martial exploits was similar to the reaction I saw in regards to martial maneuvers in 3.5's Tome of Battle supplement. Your typical D&amp;D geek would rant about how it break verisimilitude while literally anyone I talked to with any kind of martial arts or combat training would nod and point out "yes, this actually feels like real combat".<br/><br/>As far as flipping over book cases and the like, that isn't quite what I'm talking about here but 4E does have a robust set of options for adjudicating those types of situations: 1) the DM gives a +2 or -2 (basically their equivalent of advantage/disadvantage), 2) we use the rules for improvised actions from the DMG1's page 42, or 3) we use terrain powers from the DMG2. The latter option was my personal favorite and I usually build my encounters with terrain powers in mind for both PCs and NPCs to use.<br/><br/>Trent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shimrod" title="shimrod"><img alt="shimrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shimrod">shimrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481510/#Comment_481510" name="Item_279" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-01T18:38:51+00:00" title="April  1, 2019  6:38PM">April 1</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>However, here's my general experience: everyone I know who has played it has made a comment somewhat along the lines of, "It was great!

It was the only one for me where combat was engaging enough for it to not totally shut things down. A big part of it was due to the pacing mechanics making combat as much structured storywise as anything else. A big part of it also was due to how clear and easy to use the encounter-building mechanics were as far as balance. Encounters were fine-tuned to be the exact level of difficulty that they needed to be in that moment dramaturgically-speaking, so we never had the issue that came up a lot in other editions of some fights that were meant to be easy being unnecessarily hard due to balance issues or CR issues or whatever, and we also never had the inverse issue of fights that were meant to be hard being easy. With how straightforward and clear the stat blocks were, it was really easy to properly gauge how enemies would interact with things before getting into the fight, and that helped so much with not losing sight of the roleplay because with things properly balanced, we ran into much less ludonarrative dissonance than we had in other editions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481512/#Comment_481512" name="Item_281" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-01T20:38:25+00:00" title="April  1, 2019  8:38PM">April 1</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" rel="nofollow">Trent_W</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Hi <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> , yes but for me its more informed from my experience and training in martial arts</p></div></blockquote>\nOh, I'm not disputing that.

I can envision where it flows along the IIEE process in regards to character intentions, declarative statements, and action resolution --- whereas the alternative just feels like I'm fiddling with FATE bennies or something.<br/><br/>But, again, maybe that's just me.  <br/><br/>Its like <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> pointed out that I think this has less to do with game design per se and more about our individual idiosyncrasies, prior experiences, and comfort levels.<br/><br/>Trent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" title="Trent_W"><img alt="Trent_W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W">Trent_W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481549/#Comment_481549" name="Item_284" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-02T20:21:55+00:00" title="April  2, 2019  8:21PM">April 2</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Not at all!

I actually really like the stances and tricks in Heroes of the Fallen Lands. There's some neat design going on there and because they modify basic attacks they mesh very well with things like opportunity attacks, charging, and leader-triggered free attacks.<br/><br/>Backstab and Power Strike, though? And, no daily powers for martial heroes? Thanks but no thanks. It completely misses the point of why 4E was designed the way it was.

I've run mapless or TotM-style combats in a number of different systems and making the environment and terrain truly matter in those encounters is no easy task, especially for players that are visual learners. My experience has been that you have to get really really creative and pretty much write custom moves (to use PbtA parlance) for every fight --- which can get pretty draining after awhile.<br/><br/>Even with zone-based combat the terrain doesn't seem to matter *quite* as much as it would in a fully-mapped combat.

It divided the community, created some pretty major balance issues, and seemed to totally miss the point of 4E's design philosophy. There were some neat revisions, though, like the at-will stances/tricks and defender auras.<br/><br/>That being said, the DM-facing stuff from the Essentials era was downright *delightful*. The Monster Vaults have the best designed monsters in 4E, the Rules Compendium is a gem, they finally worked out the skill challenge math, and some of 4E's best adventures (such as Madness at Guardmore Abbey) comes from that time. Although for anyone serious about running 4E the way it was supposed to be run, the DMG2 (which is pre-Essentials through and through) is pretty much required reading in my opinion.<br/><br/>Trent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481576/#Comment_481576" name="Item_293" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-03T19:23:42+00:00" title="April  3, 2019  7:23PM">April 3</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" rel="nofollow">Trent_W</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I think the key difference here is that with AEDU you have a bunch of cool moves but you can only do each move one time.

I wasn't so much referring to the 5E Battlemaster here as I was contrasting, say, the 4E Weaponmaster to the 4E Slayer.<br/><br/>Personally, my favorite martial powers in 4E aren't of the "Basic Attack Plus" variety but the "You Just Did What?!" variety. Like, there's a Rogue daily power where you can hide under a Large or larger monster and just deal automatic damage to them every round until they make their saving throw. Or, the Warlord daily power that lets every ally within 5 paces of you make a free basic attack. Or, the Fighter power that is Come and Get Some. <img alt=":wink:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=":wink:"/> <br/><br/>Stuff like that makes me roll my eyes and laugh whenever I hear somebody say "every 4E class plays the same".\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>5e owes so much to 4E.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nDon't say that out loud at your local gaming store or you might get mugged. &gt;_&lt;<br/><br/>Trent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481581/#Comment_481581" name="Item_295" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-03T20:00:08+00:00" title="April  3, 2019  8:00PM">April 3</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" rel="nofollow">Trent_W</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Or, the Fighter power that is Come and Get Some. <img alt=":wink:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=":wink:"/> </p></div></blockquote>\nLuckily in 5e the fighter can also get spells!

Hunter's Mark and Swift Quiver as spells. It imbues every character with a sense of magic and wonder.<br/>I love when mundane and earthly beings can tap into the wondrous world of miracles but via an explicitly supernatural, or holy/divine, interface.<br/><br/>In 4E I didn't like how those kinds of things were... "uh this is just what you can do here, you can kill an army with a jawbone and you can reroute the Rio Grande!" as if you were beings of myth. I'm more into the style of fantasy where normal people and the fantastic meet. Spells &amp; magic items to me are tools that feel tangible, like Luke first seeing a light sabre in Ben's room. Our wizard yday spent hours in a lich's office copying spells into their spellbook. And our ranger has gotten his hand on a ghost lantern which, after months and months of carefully measuring out lamp oil and where finding unlit torches in sconces have been a more valuable treasure than gold, is an amazing item.<br/><br/>There are two ways to make wizards and fighters more equal.<br/>One is to make the spells super weak. A fireball becomes a fire-fjutt that deals as little damage as a sword chop.<br/>The other is to make the fighter being able to perform wondrous acts.<br/><br/>The latter, in turn, can done in two ways.<br/>One is to give them spells. The fantastic world of D&amp;D has permuated even them so they can go beyond the limits of reality.<br/>The other is to give them spells but call the spells exploits instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481596/#Comment_481596" name="Item_298" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-04T09:29:26+00:00" title="April  4, 2019  9:29AM">April 4</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2019 9:30AM by EmmatheExcrucian.">edited April 4</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can totally understand not liking that level of power!<br/>That level of power is a big part of what I enjoyed with 4e, tbh, but then again like, of course I did, my favorite games ever both have you playing as basically divine beings who can change the world wholesale with the snap of a finger.<br/>Myth has always clicked for me much better than fantasy, a big part of which is that I honestly just don't like fantasy as a genre at all.

A martial practitioner can't produce overtly supernatural effects, such as rays of blinding radiance or shields of invisible magic force. However, martial power does have a source, even if it is an inconspicuous one. Martial power is the combination of three qualities acting in concert: natural ability such as great strength or uncanny agility, the determination to act, and learned skill acquired through endless hours of practice. For a brief moment, the martial hero combines these three components in the performance of a move, maneuver, or feat of arms, exceeding the normal physical limitations of his or her body and training.</p>\n<p>To put it another way, most people go through their lives using only a fraction of their true capability. Martial heroes have learned how to routinely exceed their normal limits and unlock more of their physical potential than anyone else. They can't perform magical deeds, such as teleporting through alternate dimensions or becoming transparent, but they can make leaps of astonishing speed and distance or take advantage of the smallest distraction to slip out of sight. With timing and skill, a wiry halfling hero can throw a harder punch than a human laborer twice his or her size, because the halfling knows how to dig down and use more of his or her potential than the bigger, more muscular human. The human laborer might have more raw strength, but that human doesn't know how to use it the way the halfling does.</p>\n<p>The components of the martial power source are present in all creatures. However, few creatures learn to exceed their ordinary limits on a regular basis. A big, strong blacksmith driven into an absolute fury can hit with great force, but that doesn't mean than an angry blacksmith's punch is a martial exploit. It doesn't have the precise power and split-second timing that a martial hero's attack routinely achieves. Consequently, martial heroes soon exceed the skills of common people, especially in their chosen fields of expertise.</p>\n<p>Some folks believe that the gods wanted mortal races to be capable of greater achievements than the gods could envision during the days of creation, and so they bestowed the capacity for incredible deeds upon each race. Others believe that the gods unknowingly created children greater than themselves, not understanding the true limits of the mortal races they shaped so long ago. Regardless of the veracity of this story, it's true that the gods have long been fascinated with mortal heroes, especially those who accomplish great deeds without the aid of magical energy.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\nA few things stand out for me here:<br/><br/>1) As <a href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">@EmmatheExcrucian</a> correctly pointed out, 4E is drawing from myth and legend as inspiration for martial heroes here. This is something other iterations of D&amp;D fall pretty flat on, in my opinion.<br/><br/>2) There absolutely is a fictional basis for martial exploits in 4E and it ties into the larger Dawn War setting underlying the game.<br/><br/>3) There seems to be a common notion than anybody and everybody is using martial powers in 4E, whereas it truly is reserved for larger-than-life heroes. In other words, "martial" is *not* a synonym for "mundane".<br/><br/>Trent<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21865/dissociated-mechanics/p5" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21865/dissociated-mechanics">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21865/dissociated-mechanics/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21865/dissociated-mechanics/p3">3</a><a class=" p-4" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21865/dissociated-mechanics/p4">4</a><a class=" p-5" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21865/dissociated-mechanics/p5" rel="prev">5</a><a class="Highlight p-6" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21865/dissociated-mechanics/p6">6</a><a class=" p-7 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21865/dissociated-mechanics/p7" rel="next">7</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21865/dissociated-mechanics/p7" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F21865%2Fx%2Fp6%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F21865%2Fx%2Fp6%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Dissociated mechanics - Page 7 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21865/dissociated-mechanics/p7" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Dissociated mechanics - Page 7" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21865/dissociated-mechanics/p7" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="That's something I personally absolutely loved.

I'm personally not a fan of them being phrased as initiable events; I'd rather the combat system "operands" be items (weapons), conditions, locations etc rather than actions (something akin to Fate where there are basically only four actions but it all comes together to create a lot more texture because of the surrounding context).<br/><br/>Some of them have even more outlandish names like Tide of Iron or Steel Serpent Strike but it's still something that could be done.<br/><br/>But obv Come and Get It is hard to explain even using mythological terms.<br/><br/>Btw, one word I associate with mythic power? "Primal" rather than "martial".

In other words, "martial" is *not* a synonym for "mundane".</p></div></blockquote>\nThe way I used the word mundane in my earlier post was when I wrote that I love it when the mundane and the wondrous meet. As they do in Star Wars (and 4E and 5e both fall pretty flat by not including X-wings and wookiees).<br/><br/>| Human + Spellbook \u2192 Sandra approved<br/>| Human + Millenium Falcon \u2192 Sandra approved<br/>| Human + the, uh, "Force"  \u2192 Sandra approved<br/>| Human + Power of Grayskull \u2192 Sandra approved<br/>| Human + fueled by religious stuff (whether divine like the jawbone fight or infernal like some warlock pacts)  \u2192 Sandra approved<br/>| Human but can do weird shit just because \u2192 Sandra not really into it.<br/><br/>I mean sometimes I can be. And I'm not begrudging 4E for being that way.<br/><br/>But I really love a game where the interface between humanity and wonder is explicit. That's why I was happy to see the fighter and the ranger get spells now.<br/><br/>Like, my threshold for this is kinda low. Chi fueled stuff like hadoukens? Sure!<br/><br/>IDK I don't think this issue is the end of the world either way. I'm not that invested in this position. Coming from a game like Labyrinth Lord AEC (an AD&amp;D 1e clone, which is what I played after 4E but before I started running 5e), IDK, I just like the way 5e does it better. Maybe a lot of this is irrational, based on where you were in your life when you started playing the edition. Me being ready to start up a new group when the 5e Starter Set come out, fresh after finally "clicking" with roleplaying games after flailing around frustratedly for 2 decades with them... I got attached to it emotionally. The things in it that makes sense I like, the things that doesn't make sense I've changed (which isn't a good case for it, I know).<br/><br/>That's just how it is w/ 4E. Everyone that loves 4E has either:<br/><br/>1. loved the exploits straight from the start because they wanted to play mythic tier<br/>2. made peace with them because they found some way to rationalize them<br/>3. changed them, either homebrew or going essentials only<br/>4. ignored them and loved the game inspite of them<br/><br/>Emma is obv the first of those four and that's cool. IDK about Trent, could be 1 or 2. For me I'm more into the third category.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/shimrod" rel="nofollow">shimrod</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Other stuff you talk about, ghost lantern, I can see how that's magical and wondrous, but why is shooting lots of arrows a magic spell? Like, thematically?</p></div></blockquote>\nI love shooting arrows but I want to shoot them even faster and also not run out in my quiver so I'll use a spell to make the quiver magically produce the arrows to me and make it so I can draw them faster than normal. It's absolutely the sort of spell I could see a ranger want to do. Setting fire, causing ice to rain down on my forest? Naw... making my knife sharper or my quiver better? Yes, that's what I pray for.<br/><br/><small>It's also one of the most powerful spells in the game (but that's because there's sort of a bug that lets you get it at a lower level than intended so that's neither good advocacy for 5e (bug-ridden mess as it is) nor indicative of the intended power level of Swift Quiver).</small><br/><br/>It's also good and clear from a game design perspective. Just as it was clean design to make spells and exploits use the same "power" structure in 4E, it makes sense to make some of the ranger's abilities spells in 5e.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481646/#Comment_481646" name="Item_303" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-05T04:44:11+00:00" title="April  5, 2019  4:44AM">April 5</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a perfect example of "association" at work, I think.<br/><br/>One person sees "Swift Quiver" and thinks: "That's stupid.

Not sure if that's relevant, but maybe illustrates what feels appropriate ("associated"?) as a spell, for me.<br/><br/>I have no problem with Paul's second image.
