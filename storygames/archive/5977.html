At the very least, it has helped me get more into the character. <br/><br/>A couple good instances in particular.. <br/><br/>I played a character named Rats in a game of InSpectres. He wasn't exactly a "weird agent", but he was pretty damned close. Always dry-washing his hands, repeating things oddly, and usually hunched in on himself. While I can't speak for them, a few comments later on led me to believe that the character was pretty memorable.<br/><br/>Another time, I was GMing a game of Vampire. I was playing an NPC who'd been captured by the PCs. She was tied up and being questioned. I sat on the floor with my hands behind my back, and didn't break character for probably close to an hour of roleplaying, not even to describe what she was doing; Instead, I just did it. At the end of the session, one of the players, who'd never played an RPG before, but who was into acting, said that after a while, he stopped seeing me, and started to see the girl. <br/><br/>So to take my examples and translate them into advice.. <br/><br/>You don't necessarily need to go full-body LARP, but decide on some physical quirks for the character. Do they dry-wash their hands? Do they steeple their fingers when they're thinking? When they're standing quietly, do they clasp their hands in front of them, fold their arms, or are their hands always playing with something?<br/><br/>What does their voice sound like? Are they soft-spoken? Bold and gruff or oily-smooth? Do they have any pecularities of speech, such as tending to repeat things said to them, or mutter to themselves? You shouldn't do anything that isn't comfortable (such as trying to speak falsetto to mimic a woman's voice) but try to hear them speak in your head, and pick a few things that stand out to you, and reproduce them.<br/><br/>Facial expressions are also important, especially if you're in a roleplaying scene. Do they stare at who they're speaking, or do they avert their gaze? Do they have an expression that just seems natural to their face, such as a smirk or a disapproving frown? Don't worry too much about things like facial tics (unless it's a big part of the character's image) and don't obsess about being fully "in-character" during less roleplay intensive moments, such as combat.<br/><br/>Just pick a few things, and be consistent about them, and I'm sure the character will come alive both for you, and for your fellow players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133586/#Comment_133586" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-09T13:09:26+00:00" title="March  9, 2008  1:09PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I often find that I like to base my characters on characters and stuff in movies. Mannerisms, posture, etc. I watch yakuza movies a lot (modern yakuza flicks like Yakuza Demon, and historic flicks like the Zatoichi franchise), and there's a lot of behaviors and cues, even whole lines you can lift wholesale and use for your characters. Now, that's the general NPC flow, but even my characters adopt a few mannerisms from TV/movies and the like.<br/><br/>Another thing I noticed: Remember that conversation before on talking in 1st person and referring to your character in 3rd person? I notice that when I take breaks and talk about my character in 3rd person for a while, it makes those times when I go back to 1st person that much easier to get back into character. I think my own breakdown is about 30-40% 3rd person, 60-70% 1st person.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133602/#Comment_133602" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-09T14:19:02+00:00" title="March  9, 2008  2:19PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            LARP is great to help you learn this.

I remember playing Vampire, and having these amazingly detailed back-stories for every character.  In play, it was impossible to remember all that stuff, and it made making any decision on behalf of the character almost impossible.  Now I try to keep it really simple. I have two or three "always" rules about a character like "always says things in the most insulting way" or "always dithers and wanders off topic".  I don't really like putting on accents or doing physical acting, but I find I can portrey a character really well by the way they speak, their choice of words and so on.  The simpler and more obvious the character is, the more memorable they are, I've found.  Subtleties are often lost in translation.  Giving NPCs really obvious motivations and character traits makes it easier for everone.  <br/><br/>One of the best NPCs I ever played was "Mister Watkins" from a Sorcerer game.  This guy had almost zero to do with what the characters were interested in, but they kept coming back to him.  He was an old dude who kept wandering off topic to talk about other, tangential stuff.  Every so often he'd drop some really interesting information amongst the details of his neice's marriage or his hip operation when he was 60, or was it 62? No, it must have been 62, because it was the year that they built the new train station.  They don't run the trains so often now do they?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133657/#Comment_133657" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T03:58:58+00:00" title="March 10, 2008  3:58AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do you maake notations of these features?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133658/#Comment_133658" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T04:07:37+00:00" title="March 10, 2008  4:07AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            not really, but then I rarely make any kind of notation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133692/#Comment_133692" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T08:28:01+00:00" title="March 10, 2008  8:28AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two or three "always" rules, Simon?

In other words, it's one thing to say, "Do more characterization," and hope that you get off your butt and do it. But, Thor, you already have said that you're not incapable, right? The question is not how to characterize, it's having an incentive to characterize. In systems where there is such an incentive, you'll characterize more. In systems that keep characterization accessibly simple (BW), you won't "forget" how to characterize the character. <br/>\n<br/>\nMost lack of characterization occurs, in my experience, because the system being used distracts from characterization, and asks you to focus on things like which combination of feats is going to do the most damage this combat. If you use a system that promotes characterization, you'll get characterization. Simple.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133696/#Comment_133696" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T08:49:16+00:00" title="March 10, 2008  8:49AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like characterization.

As folks here have demonstrated, there are lots of good, simple tricks for playing memorable characters, and they're portable from game to game, regardless of system.<br/><br/>I'll reinforce the suggestion about simplicity, however.  Figuring out a few key elements for your NPC, including knowing what they want and how they're likely to react to the NPC's approach, makes it easier to fit into their shoes.  <br/><br/>The most memorable character I've played lately was a Civil War-era carnival barker named Benjamin Sweet.  At first, I knew next to nothing about him except that I wanted him to be irritating.  I found that when I played him I used an infuriating expression my brother has (a sort of mocking half-sneer) and a knowing patter of glancing insults strewn throughout his dialogue.  Most importantly, I only ever introduced Sweet into scenes where he wasn't a direct threat to the PCs, and where they couldn't take direct action against him.  His role was just to get their goat, and provoke them into doing stupid things.  And the players *hated* him so much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133701/#Comment_133701" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T09:17:20+00:00" title="March 10, 2008  9:17AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I sometimes try to base my characterization on people I know a bit, but not that well, so I can freely imagine certain aspects of their personality, but also clearly have someone to base them on that thinks and acts differently than myself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133702/#Comment_133702" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T09:18:53+00:00" title="March 10, 2008  9:18AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike - you have hit part of this on the head.

Animal and Prop I'm a little unsure of at this point.<br/><br/>Assuming you do these things in more than a one shot how do you code them for yourself? What allows you to get them back the next time you play the character?</blockquote>\nThese are the "codes" for the characterization, themselves. You get them back by assuming the voice, or face, or remembering your animal or prop next time the character comes up - everything else should just flow naturally from that one hint that you give yourself. (And you don't need to nail down all of them and remember everything every time - usually one or two will do for a start, and then you get the rest for free.)<br/><br/>Voice isn't necessarily an accent, just a way of speaking that conveys emotion. Change up the pace and pitch of your speech. Make an emotional noise - when you forget what your character is all about, go back to that noise, and see what comes out next. Same with Physicality/Posture and the Animal (or more accurately, a person who's like an animal) thing. You don't have to jump around and larp all over everybody to get something out of these - just squish your face around until you stop on something you like, or look at someone else's driver's license and try to copy their face. Make your character (internally) an elephant or a pigeon that's just barely hanging on to the illusion of being a person. How does that make the character behave? How does that influence their speech and mannerisms? <br/><br/>Attitude and Obsession are pretty close, but different enough to pull them apart to make a sweet acronym. You just have to pick one thing and feel *really* strongly about it. Whenever that thing comes up, it's life or death for you. You see your magic thing, and your brain screams ME WANT! But you're playing it cool on the outside - at least, you think you are. (One of the ways we direct people to play drunk is to tell them to act as sober as possible. Looks great.) <br/><br/>A Prop is just something that your character always has, that influences their ... character. Go ahead and mime it. You're already playing make-em-ups, you may as well jump all the way in. Groucho's cigar, Chaplin's cane, a Bond villain's cat, or every noir character's cigarette - they're symbols of who they are and how they feel. Give it a shot, and see what comes out the other end.<br/><br/>All of these are just bookmarks for the overall everythingness of the character you're trying to nail down. Everything isn't encoded in that one voice or squishy face, and they won't necessarily transfer between players, but this is you playing something from inside of you - hang on to your one or two characteristics for dear life, and everything else about the character is bound to follow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134516/#Comment_134516" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T23:50:08+00:00" title="March 12, 2008 11:50PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My acting teacher used to say "You feel it and the audience will feel it."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134536/#Comment_134536" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T04:04:02+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  4:04AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personality is what character's do.
