                    So, how are we doing as a community? Any thoughts? Anything you want to see more of, or less of? <br/><br/>I like to do some self-reflection every once in a while, and now that Thanksgiving Week is upon us, now's a good a time as any.<br/><br/>I can't guarantee that I'll be able to implement all the ideas generated, but I'll definitely read them all.  <br/><br/>-Andy                </div>

Very good point. All the above (except one) are in my "vision". Basically my vision included all the above, but specifically excluded the following:<br/><br/>* <b>Game Design</b> (ground-up style, not houserules and the like. The latter are fine, the former are best met elsewhere, or at least that was my idea) <br/><br/>* Uh... and this is a hard one... <b>Theory</b>. I see a lot of "let's hammer this stuff out" style discussion. And I'm glad it's going on somewhere. But not always glad that it's happening <i>here</i>.<br/><br/>* Design Diary stuff. I'm still waffling on my attitude for design diary stuff here, but I often see AP or general question thread stuff that seems more like "Here is my shit that's coming soon/Here are my thoughts on this thing I'm working on" rather than "I need some help on this. Anyone?" The latter is cool, the former is a huge grey area for me, but acceptable for now. <br/><br/>And what I wanted to have more of is:<br/><br/>* General gaming talk. Which is happening more these days, I think. <br/><br/>* Gaming-related talk. Which too is happening more these days (SF/lit discussion, etc)<br/><br/>* Directed discussion on how to make gaming better. Simple techniques, cool tricks that have worked, etc. That's sort of what I was aiming for (but didn't codify) with the Actual Play and Gamecraft forums.<br/><br/>I think that there's definitely Design Talk going down, which is awesome. I want to get more General Gaming Talk going down, too. Talk about playing and GMing tricks and the like.Tips. Process. Stuff like that. It's just something I'd like to see more of, but of course haven't gotten around to posting more of myself. :-)<br/><br/>Jason: Will get back to you on growth, but we regularly have about 2-5 new folks join a week.<br/><br/>===-=-= Now, some things I was thinking of implementing, and Why =-=-===<br/><br/>I'm no where near any sort of "Things need to be changed! We're diverting from the goals of the site!" sort of actions. The last few weeks I've just been slowly rolling around in my head what is happening with the site, and what I want (because it's even hard for me to realize what I like and don't like, without seeing all sorts of general actions and behaviors).<br/><br/>Here are some thoughts I've had.<br/><br/>Theory. I'm thinking of creating a theory category. That way we can have a flood-valve for the inevitable (constructive) discussion on more abstract theory. <br/>But theory is always changing, evolving. Like a Heraclitus egg in a Buddhism blender. So to that end, and given this site's openness to thread necromancy, every quarter or so I'll nuke all these theory threads that have gone untouched for 3-6 months. Flush them away, no permanent record. Consider it the Sand Mandala treatment of theory discussion. If someone thinks that they're awesome enough to keep permanent, they'll flush out their ideas on them and keep them archived offsite; either in their blogs, on their personal sites, or in the Story Games wiki (I see no problem with date-archiving articles based on discussion there).<br/><br/>Game Design. I'm waffling on doing the same for Game Design that I was thinking about for Theory. But for now, the group design threads are incredibly fulfilling for this site, and the personal "look at my stuff!" threads aren't NEARLY bothersome enough yet to go this route.<br/><br/>What else was there... I'm forgetting something. More later.                        </div>

                            Andy,<br/><br/>I'm pretty new around here and have to say the people here are darn nice and helpful.<br/><br/>But I do sense a schism between those who wish to "popularize" story games to a much wider audience, and those who would really prefer to dig down deep and explore the possibilities more for a peer group.  I'm really glad that both groups exist because it allows for both vertical and horizontal growth in the community.  But it seems like it's difficult to address one group without stepping on the toes of the other.<br/><br/>What are your thoughts?  Am I totally off-base here?  I wonder how deep discussion for both groups could be facilitated better.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>Chris B.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>I want something to replace or fix Gabbly, I mean, sheesh.</blockquote>
Yeah, dunno if that will happen, but I'll keep looking.  Gabbly is lite and has few features, but it's easily accessible.  I tried looking at other possible solutions, but I couldn't find anything that was solid, easy to use, intuitive, and didn't require everyone creating a new login and password.  The main candidate was jabber, but again everyone would need a second user account just to participate (and I'm not good enough at MySQL to sync them up so that folks could just log in with their S-G user/pass).  But I'll definitely keep my eyes open.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Caesar_X</cite>But it seems like it's difficult to address one group without stepping on the toes of the other.</blockquote>
I'd like to follow up more with this.  I definitely see that there's "designers" and "non-designers" in this forum (or more appropriately, "folks who like to think/talk about design", and "people who don't"), but I'm not seeing the particular axis that you're seeing. Can you maybe provide an example (even a made up one) about how it seems difficult to address one group without stepping on the toes of the other?  I want to see what you are seeing so that I can perhaps find a solution if I agree.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>Andy:  As someone who has been using Story Games as a place to think through my game design from the ground up ... where else do you think there<em>is</em>for designers who are not encountering theory and the like for the first time?</blockquote>
There isn't. I think the Forge is probably the best place in the world these days to discuss Game Design. The Design forum of TheRPGSite is too much a Battlefield, and at RPGNet it's too... I dunno... unfocused?  There's an RPG creation mailing list out there, but it's pretty retarded (I remember well the 50+ post flamewar a few years back over "is it SHOOT an arrow or FIRE an arrow?". Again, the best is The Forge, and I want to encourage people to go there. What you're looking for is RPGNet's design forum, but again it's pretty unfocused (you will get the feeling that people replying are there because they like to talk, not because they're reading or discussing your work in any meaningful way).<br/><br/>My intent was never to turn this into a place to build games. Should I rethink that?  If enough folks are interested in it, I may give it a go, but perhaps with the Theory Forum Twist above: "No guarantees of quality, and all old threads get nuked after 3 months".<br/><br/>Also, at one point Kuma/Bryan looked like he was putting together a solid Peer Workshop environment for making games. At one point he had to pull back a bit because of work concerns, but maybe in time we could revisit that instead.<br/><br/>BTW, thanks for the comments everyone. I don't necessarily want to turn this thread into a dialogue between You and Me, but I will respond if you ask questions or whatever.  Feel free to "talk to the wind" with your ideas, I won't judge anyone on them or anything like that.                        </div>

                            Personally, I don't hang out on forums for a number of reasons, but I've found it very easy to simply slide into Story Games. I never quite managed this with, say, the Forge. This isn't because there's something wrong with the Forge; it's just a function of community dynamics.<br/>I think forums tend to go through a life cycle. Once you have a certain community and a certain volume, new memberships slow down and the discussion takes a more set form. I think that's in the process of happening here. I'm very happy with the community, and I feel like I've met several people I wouldn't have met otherwise.<br/>I hope the answers to my questions don't sound arrogant. I think like a lot of people I simply haven't got a lot of time. I also tend to over-focus on particular topics at a particular time to the detriment of others.
<ol>
<li>I feel like enough of them are on my wavelength to make it worthwhile to hang out here<br/></li><li>I feel the balance is about right. I simply ignore threads that aren't of interest to me. Having all the topics in a single line is very helpful to me. If there's a "Theory" forum (like at the Forge), I simply won't read it if I'm not in a Theory mood. Here I might read the topic if it's started by someone I want to talk to, or if it touches another topic I care about today. That's useful.<br/></li><li>I don't use it because chat is evil.<br/></li><li>Probably, but I'm not sure I'll use it much.<br/></li><li>I don't use the categories much except when I post.</li>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>So, a couple questions raised (and a few more of my own):<br/><br/>1: How do you feel about the members of the community?</blockquote>
The members of the community rock. I love it here.
<blockquote>2: How do you feel about the general discussion here? Anything you'd like to see more/less of? How about Theory?</blockquote>
I'm a lot more interested in "pragmy" (theory which is a reflection on something that did or didn't work, after the fact, or is immediately testable by application) than in academic fights about words. It's good to see some of the former here; I'd like to see less of the latter, but realistically, people will do this.
<blockquote>3: What do you think of the chat feature?</blockquote>
Never used it.
<blockquote>4: Do you see merit in creating a workshop area of this site for ground-up game design?</blockquote>
Definitely. I find the idea of nuking old threads very scary, though. This is history we're making here! It should be preserved.
<blockquote>5: (my own) Any new discussion categories that you'd like to see? How do you feel about the categories in general?</blockquote>
Categories seem to work OK. I sometimes have trouble finding one that fits exactly, particularly since I'm not entirely sure what some of them are meant to be for, but I think that would continue to be the case regardless of what the categories actually were.                        </div>

<i>Can you maybe provide an example (even a made up one) about how it seems difficult to address one group without stepping on the toes of the other? I want to see what you are seeing so that I can perhaps find a solution if I agree.</i><br/><br/>Sure, I'll make something up so as not to use names/posts.  But in the end I'm sure the example will be about me anyway:)<br/><br/>Let's say I want to talk about the marketing of story games and lament about why "we" (I refer to "we" as the community; I have no published paper-and-pencil games) aren't reaching out to a potentially wider audience with our games.  I feel like some people take that as a dig on why <span style="text-decoration: underline;">they</span> aren't doing more to market their own games or perhaps alter them to be more marketable to non-gamers.  I feel like there are three different topics at play here:<br/><br/>1. How I can make my game more awesome and push the boundaries of paper-and-pencil story gaming.<br/>2. How my game can more effectively be marketed to the existing customer base given the fact that this is probably a part-time hobby for me.<br/>3. How can the community as a whole grow itself past the "enlightened ex-D&amp;D players" market and find greater commercial success.<br/><br/>I feel that all three of these are very important, but it's difficult to talk about them all at the same time.  I will say personally that as an experienced computer game designer, I am very interested in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> as it is a new challenge for me.  I feel like I already understand <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> pretty well and it isn't really relevant to my situation.  And I am very interested in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> because I want to see this genre see real growth and share the passion with many other non-gamers.  But others will have differing takes on all three.<br/><br/>And on this forum, I feel very comfortable talking about <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, I sense frustration from some game designers about <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, and I feel like I am barking up the wrong tree on <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>.  And so I wonder whether I should just shut up about trying to "popularize" story games and concentrate on trying to learn the craft of designing these games for my own non-commercial purposes.<br/><br/>What do you think, Andy?  Would a category called something like "Popularizing Story Games" be helpful here if the intent was not to tell someone else how to design or market their own game?<br/><br/>Chris B.                        </div>

                            Here's something I notice and dislike - people shilling their own stuff.  Not in Directed Promotion threads, where it is fine, but in threads where people ask for advice.  "The answer to your query is, in all cases, my game."<br/><br/>There was a recent thread where somebody asked about what the most vital hippie games to own were, and much of the thread was straight pimpage by designers.  What's up with that?  I'd rather see more modesty, more Making You Awesome (tm) between publishers, less of the opposite of these things.                        </div>

<p>I really miss Gabbly. I think it was the single greatest feature of the site. It's much easier to ask exploratory questions at that rate of discussion, and it's much easier to explain things in dialogue. I'd be way into Jabber or something similar.</p>
<p>I think the "theory" on SG is kind of bunk. I mean, this stuff's largely retreading old, well-worn paths, and I think a lot of folks want to either a) invalidate earlier theory because they think Ron's a dick or b) claim discovery for something on their own and are put on the defensive when it's revealed that others have thought that out. I think it's great to rediscover something other people know, and it's great to have a place to discuss that, but "I think earlier theory is wrong because I don't understand it" is an inference I make with exceptional ease in these pages.</p>
<p>I love the talk about settings, fiction, and technique of play.</p>

Hey dude, Gabbly's still around (never went anywhere).  It's right on the left side there, just click on "Start Chat!" under "Who's Online".<br/><br/>Admittedly, Gabbly still has that issue where sometimes (depending on how you join) other people's names sometimes don't show up in the "listed gabbers" column, but their words still show up and can be read fine.<br/><br/>If you don't see "Start Chat!" on the left side, let me know. That smells like a Stylesheet issue, and I'll set about correcting it.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            I worry that people are getting less polite. There's been a few too many posts where people are sarcastic or say that something is "your problem". You know? I hesitate to give the threads, because I don't want to point the finger, but I wish people would be nice. When I first joined Story Games, everyone was polite to each other and said good morning to each other and we all left our doors unlocked and didn't worry about thieves.<br/><br/>That connects to what Jason said about people pimping their own games. Some pimping's cool, but there was a weird atmosphere in that one thread.<br/><br/>I rather like the Theory threads, even though I'm not really a theory person. I like the fact that ideas are bubbling away.<br/><br/>On the Game Design thing: I love the fact that I came to Story Games and said "Hey, I want a game about Meat Loaf"; and everyone gave me crazy ideas; and I said "Well, what about these mechanics?"; and people tweaked them or said "What about this?"; and within a couple of months I had a fully functional game. It was great. I couldn't have done that anywhere else.<br/><br/>I like the comedy threads that pop up from time to time: the Bargleflap thread, for example. They're a good way of letting off steam (and I have a weird theory that they offer very focussed discussion, in their way). <br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            1: Most people here seem cool.  I wish it was a more diverse crowd, but I feel that way about the roleplaying community in general.  I also don't feel that people here necessarily push me to be a better designer and player in the ways I wish that they would.  Maybe I should start a thread about that...<br/><br/>2: The discussion is fun and friendly.  I'd say about 20% of the time we're talking about things that I think are important, 40% of the time we're talking about things that interest me (that includes the previous 20%). That's a higher ratio than most sites I know. The ratio of threads that nobody seems to really be enjoying (and yet participates in anyway) seems to be increasing, though.  It's still a very small number, but there have been more of them lately.<br/><br/>3: I've used the chat feature a couple times and it blows.<br/><br/>4: Game design might need it own section separate from everything else to keep from highjacking things.  I'm not sure if I'd use it, but it would obviously depend on what the community was like and how much feedback it generated.  I'm kinda used to using my own blog for that stuff.  Any game design area would need really clear, strict guidelines.  Like encouraging people to publish things that were complete enough to play, even if they were sketchy outlines.  None of the dicking around that dominates game design forums, where nothing substantial ever gets produced.  I would almost say it needs to be moderated or heavily self-moderated, preferably by people who will push each other to finish games in a firm, supportive but not aggressive way.  That 's part of what I mean about wanting people to push me to be a better designer. Learning how to play well together is one thing.  Learning how to support each other in design is another.  It's still about making each other awesome, though.  I have that kind of relationship with a few other designers and it is critical to my work.  If SG could make that happen on a larger scale, that would be awesome.<br/><br/>5: I don't pay attention to categories at all unless I'm starting a new thread and have to pick the one that best describes my post.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>So, a couple questions raised (and a few more of my own):<br/><br/>1: How do you feel about the members of the community?</blockquote>
I haven't been here very long (And not very active so far...), but it's nice. What initially attracted me was the friendly and easy-going mentality Story Games seemed to have and so far my first impression was correct: It is friendly and easy-going.
<blockquote>2: How do you feel about the general discussion here? Anything you'd like to see more/less of? How about Theory?</blockquote>
I like the mix of discussion. Regarding theory, I wouldn't really miss it but people seems to be interested, so why not? 
<blockquote>3: What do you think of the chat feature?</blockquote>
I tried it a few times, but more or less nobody was online and the thing is a bit of a pain in the ass to use on my ancient computer. (Some sort of Jabber server for Story-Games would rock, IMO.)
<blockquote>4: Do you see merit in creating a workshop area of this site for ground-up game design?</blockquote>
Sure, why not. At worst, people will just ignore it and at best we help to make cool stuff. But I can see why you'd prefer people to go to the Forge (Which I think is an awesome place for game design.), so...<br/><br/>M                        </div>

                            1: How do you feel about the members of the community?<br/>
Most of the people here seem nice enough. I really get the sense I am in the Non-design / more old school / type of gamer and waffle daily on whether to ask you to delete my account or not. But I have met a few nice people here.<br/>
<br/>
2: How do you feel about the general discussion here? Anything you'd like to see more/less of? How about Theory?<br/>
I came here from another site, not having a clue what was going on here. The threads I like the best so far are the Mashups we would like to see and Japanese RPG Madness. I do have a good 15 bookmarked too though, take that with a grain of salt.<br/>
<br/>
3: What do you think of the chat feature?<br/>
I didnt know there was one. I would use it and will look for it now. <br/>
<br/>
4: Do you see merit in creating a workshop area of this site for ground-up game design?<br/>
Yes I do. That I find interesting on a few levels (But I am the setting person not the system and I have no urge to innovate so maybe I DONT Belong here what do you think?)<br/>
<br/>
5: (my own) Any new discussion categories that you'd like to see? How do you feel about the categories in general?<br/>
I dont even look at the categories. I use the bookmarked feature a lot and follow the posts that way.                        </div>

                            I like your batcave, Andy. <br/><br/>Specifically, I like that it has couches and a big-ass game table and stuff, and that it doesn't have a big drafting table. I know where to find that place if/when I need it, but this is a lounge, not a factory. I value that.  <br/><br/>I like almost all the people here, and if I were the evil overlord here there's only a few people I might narrow my eyes at.<br/><br/>I don't use the chat feature - if I did, I would get no work done at all. <br/><br/>If there were a ground-up design studio (y'know, with design tables and lathes and, uh, pottery wheels and shit) next to the lounge, I might pop my head in from time to time, but largely I'd miss out on its goings on, which would be fine with me. I wouldn't like it if all those threads of people seriously getting stuff done were interspersed with my gaming lounge. But, y'know, that's just reflective of my own tastes, and its not like i'd quit coming here if the ground-up game design became a larger feature. Same with the 'let's talk business' threads because, well, I'm not in the business (yet). But lots of you are and I value that.<br/><br/>Like Jonathan, I only ever look at categories when starting a post, to make sure I won't get audited/moved.                        </div>

                            Correct me if I'm wrong, but the thing I like best is that if something is brought up and it isn't worth discussing after a certain point, the thread dies. I've seen too many ginormous threads on other forums and you're left wondering if there's something all the way through about the original post or if its just crap after page 3. I guess what I'm talking about is a well-maintained board, mostly policed by its constituency.                        </div>

                            Right. <br/><br/>1: How do you feel about the members of the community?<br/><br/>I like them, I hate them, they excite me and they drive me nuts in turns. Some of my favorite people are here, but I still have to spill a bottle into the gutter for those we've lost: the Jessicas and Bruces and Chads (though Chad has been back a bit recently, and I hope that continues). Their voices are much missed. <br/><br/>2: How do you feel about the general discussion here? Anything you'd like to see more/less of? How about Theory?<br/><br/>Mostly I'm good with what gets discussed. Not always happy with how it gets discussed or the tendancy for us to talk to the "audience" rather than each other -- but it's still better than the competition. <br/><br/>3: What do you think of the chat feature?<br/><br/>'s cool that its there, but its functionality is twitchy. I still go to the Foundry when I'm really looking to talk to people for more than one liners or jokes. <br/><br/>4: Do you see merit in creating a workshop area of this site for ground-up game design?<br/><br/>Sure. I won't use it, but then I'm difficult like that. <br/><br/>5: (my own) Any new discussion categories that you'd like to see? How do you feel about the categories in general?<br/><br/>I never notice them unless I'm starting a new thread. I always just read the page from the "all discussions" tab.                        </div>

                            1: How do you feel about the members of the community?<br/><br/>I like the members; can't really pinpoint something I wouldn't like or could not tolerate. The general mood is tolerating and while there is a strong focus on certain styles of play and certain kind of games, you can discuss other things without  things turning either chaotic or too tightly focused. I think the word I'd describe for the mood is Relaxed.<br/><br/>2: How do you feel about the general discussion here? Anything you'd like to see more/less of? How about Theory?<br/><br/>The thing I like about discussion here is that it's allowed to drift and it's not that tightly focused, but on the other hand, participants make an effort not to get locked into semantics or Me vs You -battles. Also, Charitable Reading actually happens.<br/><br/>I don't know about theory; I'm not really intrested in theory for theory's sake. I am intresting in discussing about roleplaying, in general and in the wide sense of the word, even theoretical sense, if we can just keep out the arcane elements of vocalbury and existing theories in check.<br/><br/>3: What do you think of the chat feature?<br/><br/>I like it and use it from time to time.<br/><br/>4: Do you see merit in creating a workshop area of this site for ground-up game design?<br/><br/>I'm not intrested in game design as such, but I wouldn't mind.<br/><br/>5: (my own) Any new discussion categories that you'd like to see? How do you feel about the categories in general?<br/><br/>The line between the categories, as always, is fuzzy. I don't really check them while reading, but have to do some mental juggling when starting a thread. But that's okay. I think there are enough categories as it is.<br/><br/>My question would be this: Both the name of the site and the rules of the site advocate Story Games which, at least to me, appear to be a certain type of roleplaying games, one that not incidentally is very appealing to majority of members here. How tight should this focus be? Is the site more like a forum for Story Games where things can drift towards other styles of roleplaying, but some focus should be kept, or more like a general purpose roleplaying forum where the focus just happens to be what majority of participants like?                        </div>

                            1: The folks here are usually pretty good, especially about trying to figure out what others are really saying. <br/><br/>2: The discussions seem to come in waves of interesting-boring, with a period of about two weeks. It's not easy to put my fingers on why I find certain things interesting, though. I'm fine with theory, but I tend to skip the discussions because the individual posts are long enough to lose my interest.<br/><br/>3: Never used chat; probably won't unless I meet some of these folks in real life.<br/><br/>4: It might be useful, but what do you mean by "workshop area"? If it's just another category of discussions, that's fine; there's just nothing new in that. If there's something additional that comes along with that, it might be interesting.<br/><br/>5: Nah, seems fine to me as-is. Adding other categories is not necessary, nor will it destroy the world if you do it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Removing existing categories does seem like it would cause overlap problems, though.                        </div>

How about Theory?<br/>Over all, I think it's pretty decent. I like that there is room for both actual critique and feedback, and also sillyness and ways to let off steam. It also seems like, when there are minor dust-ups, people settle them pretty reasonably.

It's easy enough to not go there if you don't want to take part. There's the inevitable discussion about ownership and credit due, of course, which I think would be handled in a case-by-case fashion.<br/><br/>5: (my own) Any new discussion categories that you'd like to see?

<p>Dev, I think that's really cool! You're basically suggesting like a community-bonding appendix that's throttled so it doesn't take over the forum and dilute its purpose, right? Awesome. (Also, as you say, it's more or less a formalisation of something this community does automatically.)</p>
<p>Andy, 1: I like tis community on the whole. I can say honestly that I don't really enjoy talking to all members of it, and I grieve the departure of others, but on the whole it's a great group of people and I'm glad for a place to talk with them comfortably.</p>
<p>2: In general it's good here. The 'games &amp; gaming' category usually has something cool to read. I would love to see more concrete talk about specific games. I'd love to talk with people about tweaking things. I miss the early days where people would toss around all kinds of orpgan mechanics and game ideas in Little Ideas.</p>
<p>Also, it'd be great if people would flag it in their titles when an Actual Play (I don't read those, usually) turns into something with broader applicability, as it often does. "Stuff to Watch" is awesome, and it could include pointers to good threads right here, I think. That'd improve the referenceability of good stuff in the future.</p>
<p>3: It's okay. Buggy and unstable, but as a supplement to IRC it's acceptable.</p>
<p>4: I do. I don't know how you'd implement that, as it would be difficult to construct a <em>useful</em> workshop area, but if such a thing could be dne than it'd be great. (I'm thinking that an open workshop is not exactly the most useful thing, but if one could open a discussion that's visible only to, say, himself plus Michael and Elizabeth and David and Fatima, then that's cool and useful.)</p>
<p>5: There is definitely something weird about the categories! I don't know exactly what it is, though. When I have category-doubt I usually mention that in my post. Maybe if we all did this for a couple of weeks, you'd be able to determine if there's anything really amiss, or if this doubt is identifying stuff that doesn't really go with the direction of the forum as you would like it.</p>

                            I'm pretty new here, but I'm finding this to be a really friendly, fun community.  I'm pretty new to gaming, and I rarely feel awkward about jumping in and sharing my experiences, limited as they may be.  I don't know how much I actually contribute to peoples' understanding, but I don't feel like I'm just making noise unecessarily or anything.  It's pretty cool.  I expect that as I start running my own games, I'll probably have a lot more crunchy/"help me figure this out" questions, especially since I'm inexperienced.  And I don't worry that people will mock me for not being able to figure things out. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

<b>1: How do you feel about the members of the community?</b><br/>
So far I've found people to be courteous, which I greatly value.  I keep expecting the hand grenade toss ("Game X is not a STORY game, you reprobate pithecantropus!"  "N00b! yur game suxxx!") but it hasn't come so far.  Maybe I've been left "damaged" by years of reading other boards?  ^_^  Seriously though, I find it intimidating to join a new board and start posting but it has been good so far.  I am very interested by what some people have to say, less by others but no one has struck me as someone not worth reading.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2: How do you feel about the general discussion here? Anything you'd like to see more/less of? How about Theory?</b><br/>
I like Actual Play discussions, and discussions of how various games can be tweaked for different settings, moods, or group styles.  Theory?  Meh.  I rarely read much of it after the first half-dozen posts in a thread.  I don't object to it being there but I won't be a big reader.<br/>
<br/>
<b>3: What do you think of the chat feature?</b><br/>
I haven't used it; I'm not fond of online chat.  It always feels like deaf men having parallel conversations.<br/>
<br/>
<b>4: Do you see merit in creating a workshop area of this site for ground-up game design?</b><br/>
I'm not qualified to answer since I would not use it.  While I'm interested in hearing what a designer was trying to do when  s/he was writing a game, and what thoughts s/he has on using it for a variety of campaigns, I don't really read the minutia of discussions between game designers.  (It reminds me of getting my eyes examined: "Is it better like this... or like that?  Like this... or like that?")<br/>
<br/>
<b>5: Any new discussion categories that you'd like to see? How do you feel about the categories in general?</b><br/>
I rarely look at threads by category.                        </div>

                            I think Andy should totally be a fascist about the look and feel of the site. It's not like he didn't pay cash money out of his own pocket to get some new stylesheets. Something that makes me say, "I'm looking at Story Games" and not yet another Vanilla site.<br>
<br>
Yes, Categories are almost completely useless due to Vanilla's presentational style. You may as well make a J-RPG category though.<br>
<br>
Chat is pretty useless for serious discussion -- it lowers the quality of content that much more -- but I'm a little curious if the thing is suitable for actual gaming.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

<b>1: How do you feel about the members of the community?</b><br/>
<br/>
I like nearly everyone, and I feel like we're unusually blessed with extremely well-spoken, patient, friendly people.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2: How do you feel about the general discussion here? Anything you'd like to see more/less of? How about Theory?</b><br/>
<br/>
The rambling-yet-disciplined style is what has kept me here even as my own gaming was moribund. Then I found myself in a group! Meeting weekly! That's pretty cool right there. As for what I'd like to see, thoughts on that below in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<b>3: What do you think of the chat feature?</b><br/>
<br/>
I'm ambivalent about it. However, <b>hey, Andy,</b> I'd be happy to help out with Jabber. I've installed it before and gotten it to source its authentication from non-canonical places before (LDAP, which is probably orders of magnitude more evil than MySQL). I can sling MySQL decently. I'd also be in favour of some scheduled IRC stuff . . . again, see below.<br/>
<br/>
<b>4: Do you see merit in creating a workshop area of this site for ground-up game design?</b><br/>
<br/>
Sure. I'd like to see a structured, actual workshoppy thing. Our community and others have proven they can do scheduled stuff with deadlines and all--why not actual workshops? As in, a few people bring in ideas, a couple relative greybeards instruct loosely, and try to get to a result. The various structured lists of questions are neat and all, but there's nothing like a little peer pressure.<br/>
<br/>
I'd also be into "jam sessions" on IRC or Jabber--I know chat does have a tendency to be superficial but I have gotten a lot out of hashing out designs in real time (relatively speaking) on <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23indierpgs&amp;Mode=like">#indierpgs</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<b>5: (my own) Any new discussion categories that you'd like to see? How do you feel about the categories in general?</b><br/>
<br/>
I tend to just pick the thread titles that interest me, as I think others are saying. Temporary, workshop areas might be good though. I like "off-topic topic of the month" as an idea, too.                        </div>

                            I want to like it here, but it's too damn nice. I'm really, really not kidding. <br><br>There is no mechanism to be critical, because the moderation is "Hey, gang, play nice." I DO play nice and yet am not pleased with a handful of discussions I've participated in. I think the "dont' harsh anyone's buzz" vibe going around is ... annoying. As in: Counter the nicey-nice community in some way, and they'll not respond your ideas. I found this annyoing enough to take a breather from the forum altogether.

I think that sucks.<br><br>So, I'd love to see a bit more discussion and a bit less can't-we-all-just-get-along hippiness, because I think SG is becoming more of a comfort blanket and less a place in which valuable content develops to RPG hobbyists.

If story-games was not what it is, I would not be here, period.<br><br>The stridency and aggression of the Forge (or rather, the stridency and aggression that tends to arise once I start shooting my fool mouth off at the Forge) is what keeps me away from discussions at the Forge, and away from saying that I'm a "Forge Guy".<br><br>I'd really like not to see that happen here.<br><br>Because, by contrast, I actually spend time here, check to see what's up, and even get in an occasional conversation that, if it was held on the Forge, would produce a kind of dialogue that would either bring back Ye Olde Flamey Fred or send me running for the hills.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Fred, please consider that I'm neither clamoring for this place being like the Forge, nor suggesting that there are merely off and on switches of "agression." Furthermore, who's advocating agression? Not me. Assertion, certainly. Not agression. One exact reason I find SG frequently disappointing is people conflating those two things. It's not "Matt's speaking strongly, and I disagree with his position." It's "Matt's mean, and meaness is right out."                        </div>

                            Why must it be flawlessly? The bar needn't be set so high. That's an extreme demand that just unattainable, and thus strikes me as a means to say, "Eh, why worry?

                            Matt, <br><br>What you just described is the fallacy of the excluded middle. A fallacy that we all tend to make on forums quite frequently.                        </br></br></div>

                            I'm not familiar with that, Brand. I don't know what it is, nor whether you're saying I've <i>made</i> the fallacy in poor form, or that I'm lamenting the occurence of the fallacy (itself not good). Can you clarify?                        </div>

                            Brand was commenting that you were lamenting on the occurrence of the fallacy. The excluded middle means that the're just one option or another, nothing in between; as you commented, that folks are saying "Since we can't be perfect, let's drop it altogether": That there's only "always doing it right 100% fo the time", and "avoiding it entirely".<br><br>Food for thought, and my thoughts on the matter are swinging around on the sister thread soon.  Thanks everyone for your comments, I really appreciate them!<br><br>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></div>
