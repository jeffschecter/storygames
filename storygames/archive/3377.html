In it, characters possess alien monsters to fight the alienses. However, all the characters are in the same monster's body. I never got my group to play it back then.<br/><br/>Has anyone here tried it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh" title="jdrakeh"><img alt="jdrakeh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/909/nZA3BEK4G6OHW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh">jdrakeh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76538/#Comment_76538" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-18T17:17:10+00:00" title="June 18, 2007  5:17PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, I've played all of the Marquee Press games (Legendary Lives, Lost Souls, etc). The system in Khaotic is a variation on that found in the other games, with one-sided rolls (the GM doesn't have to roll dice) and levels of success based on roll quality that determine everything from basic task outcomes to damage dealt in combat. All of this works well (as it does in the other games). <br/><br/>The problem here is the basic premise. Unless you have <i>very</i> well-adjusted players, you can pretty much be assured that your group will spend more time fighting for control of the vessel in the alternate universe than pursuing any kind of real goal. This can be fun for a while, though it quickly grows very tiring, IME. <br/><br/>I think you'd be best off running Khaotic one-shots or interspersing the 'epsiodes' of your Khaotic campaign amongst other game sessions to alleviate the aforementioned problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
