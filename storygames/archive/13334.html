The characters will be an oddball crew of a small space vessel in the world of Twilight Imperium, a strategic boardgame. Keywords: Politics, the cold war, Firefly, space mysticism, an emphasis on cultural differences...<br/><br/>Does anyone already have a body of keys, secrets and abilities for a setting like this? Maybe an idea for ship-to-ship combat? Would be mighty helpful. :-)<br/><br/>So far, I'm thinking I should keep Vigor, Instinct and Reason, maybe rename them Hard, Smooth and Quick. Also add a Power pool for influence in different circles. (Trade, politics, nations...)<br/>Social abilities would be Threaten (Hard, needs a power leverage), Convince/seduce (Smooth, needs privacy) and Negotiate (Quick, needs a desirable leverage), to emphasis the theme of politics and negotiations, even in one-on-one confrontations.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/epweissengruber" title="epweissengruber"><img alt="epweissengruber" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/epweissengruber">epweissengruber</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300405/#Comment_300405" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-11T09:48:31+00:00" title="November 11, 2010  9:48AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will be following this closely and (hopefully) contributing to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/docholaday" title="docholaday"><img alt="docholaday" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/docholaday">docholaday</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300462/#Comment_300462" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-11T13:56:46+00:00" title="November 11, 2010  1:56PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 11, 2010 1:57PM by docholaday.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Solid idea.

One thing that comes to mind immediately is that all of the races in the game might not work that well as player characters; perhaps better not to force it and just focus on making a couple or three playable, especially considering the work involved in giving a solid mechanical treatment for a whole race, even in a genre that basically treats aliens as people in make-up. Pick a focal point for the campaign, essentially; it would be a huge undertaking to create a solid crunch landscape for the entire setting, but if you know that the game will basically concern the diplomatic difficulties between the human and Kievan (Kiev? Was that the name of those assholes who use mercenary troops that fight harder when you pay more?) spheres of influence, then you'll know where to focus your effort.<br/><br/>I like a "Community" Pool, I've been using that lately in Solar System a lot - fits many settings well. Typically such a Pool won't have traditional Abilities associated with it so much as it'll have social positions. "Magnate of the Nagalite Trade Network at Experienced (2)", that sort of thing. Almost like inherent Abilities, but not really, as it represents your character's history and stature in society more than his social skills. In fact, this sort of set-up does not need or want social skills, really; it's not that much of a stretch to just treat individual relationships as Abilities under that same Pool as well, and just have characters make checks at the default rank when they interact with strangers who they don't have any fitting social history for. Perhaps make a "Secret of Charm" or similar for when a player wants his character to genuinely have an edge in incidental social situations that don't involve established relationships.<br/><br/>A lighter alternative take on a character's "Circles" would be to treat that sort of thing as Secrets: instead of a Pool and Abilities that depict a character's political pull just say that a character can have a <i>Secret of Faction (specify)</i> that allows them to use their social Abilities at higher leverage, perhaps with some mechanical boost as well. Perhaps you can sweet-talk a personal favour out of the Nagalite Magnate even if you're basically strangers, but if you want him to loan you a space ship, that shit's not gonna fly unless you're actually part of the network yourself.<br/><br/>But anyways, regarding starships, I'm currently relatively happy with a lightweight solution where the ship is simply a tool that allows its officer corps to use their relevant Abilities to get shit done. As a mechanical interface, just use your favourite equipment model. I discuss this in the World of Near in the <a href="http://solarwiki.janus-design.it/en/book/5th-movement-margin-notes#seafaring-ocean-adventures" rel="nofollow">seafaring section</a>. (Spaceships are best treated as sailing ships anyway.)<br/><br/>I would totally create material based on the boardgame for this sort of thing: the racial special powers can often be turned into Secrets to get a basic idea of what the deal is with each individual race, and perhaps space navigation happens literally on the hex map. One approach that comes to mind is that perhaps you rebuild the map each time the game goes into star travel mode (putting it away when the action moves to individual solar systems), justifying the changing stellar geography with the fact that it's a 2D model of a 3D universe, anyway <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> And have some weird crunch for how you move from hex to hex (and star system to star system, therefore); perhaps each time you want to travel a hex you make a Navigation Ability check or some such, and failure means getting lost of breaking your stardrive or being late or whatever. (Perhaps you move at most your level of success in hexes before having to stop for maintenance at some world.) I could see myself using post-it notes that I stick on individual board pieces to keep track of established facts conserning individual worlds of the galaxy.<br/><br/>This sound rather fun, actually. Lots of crunch that could be created to establish the major themes (space mysticism definitely wants to have a distinctive angle, for example), but that's the sort of thing that can be bootstrapped largely as you play; just get some basic shit together about the races and social stuff for players to create their characters with, and then add more once you know who the characters are and what the basic situation is and where the game starts (on which world, I mean). Remember that it's perfectly feasible for the genre to have the characters start relatively white-bread; the universe is such an amazing place that they'll pick up color and identity through play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300547/#Comment_300547" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-12T09:11:42+00:00" title="November 12, 2010  9:11AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a Firefly style game a while back, pretty successful.

I like all of it, but one thing got me thoughtful. No social skills.<br/><br/>Really? Hmm. Yes, I can see that makes sense, both the influence rolls and social rolls would involve you getting what you want from other people, with the pool involving you calling in old favors and such. <br/><br/>About leverage:<br/><br/>I would really like to emphasis leverage. If you're not in a position to urge people to do what you want out of loyalty, you might be in a position to get them to do what you want or give you what you want with the leverage of goods and favors, or threat of violence. Fits very well with the cold war and merchant themes of Twilight Imperium. <br/><br/>I could give bonus dice to characters with leverage, but I also feel that threatening or negotiating with someone is something else entirely than relying on your relationship with them, and some people might be strong in one but weaker in another. I really like the Apocalypse World mechanics where a succesful Go Aggro roll does not cause the other part to cave in, but s/he instead chooses between caving in or forcing your hand.<br/><br/>You're talking about the Barony of Letnev, by the way. A gene-enhanced race bred for war. The reason they fight better with trade goods is because they are dependent on goods they cannot produce or grow in their barren world. One of my players is aching to play a letnev killing machine with a serious dependency on medicine and technology to keep his genetical disaster of a body functioning. Awesome.<br/><br/>Will definitly restrict race choices, (Naalu, Muuat and L1Z1X would probably work not so well) but I get the feeling the players will spontaneously pick good ones. One Hacan (Merchant lion), that's for certain, and then probably one Letnev and one Mentak (Pirate nation of ex-convicts. I've started imagining them as these queer theory, post-constructionalist who are trying to build a nation on something else than species and tradition. So cool!)<br/><br/>Eero and docholaday; I hadn't thought about it actually, but my players suggested we build the galaxy out of the tiles. Why not? Every planet has a little inspiring flavour text to work from, and it would be cool to play through different worlds, making those tiles mean something when you return to the boardgame. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300663/#Comment_300663" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-13T02:51:08+00:00" title="November 13, 2010  2:51AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like social leverage, yes. I find that it's central in preventing the sort of poisonous mind control social skills that stakes-utilizing rpg systems fall into now and then in practical application - the sort where a player insists that his character solves all his problems by talking others into agreeing with him, whether it's credible or not. In Solar System it's clearly up to the Story Guide to say no when a player would like his character to simply "convince" another into doing something. Where there is no leverage (which can be simply understood as a reason for the other guy to do what you ask), then there is no opportunity to use that "Charm" or "Talking" or whatever other such Ability. Especially good when you can <i>accede</i> to leverage requested by the player and thus affirm a dramatic point: "Yes, in fact this NPC loves you - you get to roll to convince him." This is in fact pretty much the difference between social Abilities and magical mind alteration in the Solar System - what needs to have been pre-established in the fiction for the Ability to have leverage to function.<br/><br/>All that said, one thing I often have trouble with is the fiction-internal logic of various social Abilities. That is, I like it very much when Abilities are understandable as identity elements and quasi-realistic, concrete facets of character identity. It is very typical for roleplaying games to have separate social skills such as threatening, bargaining and seducing - I'm not sure how much this makes sense to me. Especially threatening doesn't seem to me like a skill or ability function, really; in the real world, do we really get people who are better than other people at threatening others? If we do, is this really an important enough facet of their personality to devote an entire Ability to? Doesn't using that Ability get repetitive? Isn't threatening somebody more of a <i>choice</i> than a skill, no matter what modern D&amp;D says? These are the sorts of questions I ask myself when I need to split the range of social interactions into Abilities. I don't know if replacing the range with relationship-specific Abilities is better, but at least it's something interesting to consider.<br/><br/>(The above should be understood as general musing, nothing to do with your particular campaign; if you like social Abilities and don't feel like having them in addition to specific relationship mechanics is too much overlap, then go to it.)<br/><br/>Anyway, yes - Barony of Letnev would certainly feature somehow were I to do this campaign. They're more human-like than some of those critters for one thing, makes drama a bit easier. Based on that character plan it seems that your group has a good handle on the cool possibilities in the setting, which means that you're already most of the way into a successful campaign, it seems to me. Hacanites and Mentaks make for good characters, too, I suppose - I might personally have trouble with the PC group consisting of this salad bar of different alien races (dilutes the viewpoint and tones down intra-group relationships), but as long as everybody is presumed to have roughly the same social standards and such, I guess it can work sort of like D&amp;D does with its "cosmetically challenged humans as non-humans" style.<br/><br/>Speaking of Mentaks, what you said reminds me of the <a href="http://solarwiki.janus-design.it/en/book/5th-movement-margin-notes#pere-di-fey-the-humble-avalon" rel="nofollow">Pere-di-Fey</a> of Near. Might be something usable there in terms of crunch or viewpoints.<br/><br/>Overall it seems that you have a good handle on this. If you have the time, perhaps you could write us a bit about the underlying mythology of the setting - I distinctly remember that there is this old imperial capital world in the middle of the galaxy, and most or all of the starfaring civilizations are heirs of the old empire, for instance. Then there was indeed some framework for space mysticism, I think, but I can't remember what it was - some priesthood of the old empire, or was it that one of the races/factions consisted of space mystics?<br/><br/>Also, if you already know a bit about the characters and the basic situation (a Traveller-esque setup involving a small spaceship and a big Galaxy), then you totally need to pick some focus for your backstory: what is happening right now, what sort of shit you'll throw at the players, concrete NPCs and Bangs to play with, that sort of thing. Once you generate some fluff it'll be much easier to perceive what you need to crunch up and how, exactly. Then it's just a matter of making up a default Ability list of some sort to give to the players to mull over; Secrets and Keys can be all but pulled straight out of default options in a campaign of this sort, I'd expect.<br/><br/>Speaking of crunch, it occurs to me that one thing I might do to get a handle on all the various space races running around would be to sort of categorize and crunchify them based on their mutual similarities reflected as Pool arrangements. This is something I've been doing now and then, the idea that the really <i>different</i> non-humans differ from each other not in mere Ability sets, but in fact in their basic building blocks; a character without a given Pool is automatically unable to learn or use Abilities based on that Pool, so saying that Humans are Vigor/Instinct/Reason while Hacanites are Instinct/Reason/Blaargh automatically categorizes and differentiates the sort of crunch each can possess. Perhaps a majority league of "human-like" aliens is defined by the sphere of beings that have the same or almost the same Pools as humans do, while the outlier weird critters only share one Pool with humans, if that.<br/><br/>As an example of what I mean (and still without referencing a primary source on the setting), you could say that a given race with the telepathic thing going for it might have the Pool of "Psion" that everything psionic latches into. Then another cybernetic race might have "Computing" Pool or whatever you'd call it to depict that element. Once you'd have this sort of crunch basis established, you could do all sorts of interesting things simply. For example, how would a human psion work. Could be like this:<br/><br/><b>Secret of Psion-Corps</b><br/>Psionic powers can be triggered in humans (and other critters with both Reason and Instinct) by gene-therapy; only 15% of the candidates survive on average; for a PC make an endure check to survive the treatment in play. The character is psionic and can spend his Instinct Pool in lieu of Psion Pool; he may also learn crunch that depends on the existence of a Psionic Pool. <i><b>Cost:</b></i> 1 Reason per scene + whatever Instinct spent<br/><br/>Or like this:<br/><br/><b>Secret of Wildling Psion</b><br/>Humans (and other beings with Instinct) living in a psionically active environment for a long time often develop rudimentary powers themselves. Such "wild" psions are usually not as powerful (or as flashy, at least) as the factory-produced variety, but in some places (eg. Hecton Mex or whatever that capital world was) you can find quite large populations naturally capable. The character now has a Psionic Pool at 0, and is able to use and improve it normally.<br/><br/>Thinking about it, this approach might be too complex crunch-wise for a first game, but at least it's sort of aesthetic and logical - and puts racial differences into clear mechanical terms, which helps in generating new ideas. Good crunch-creation often follows not only the fluff, but also the internal mechanical logic of whatever the approach is. Once you have conventions (such as deciding that psionicism is handled as a separate Pool), those give you something to fall back on when creating variations on the theme and depicting various nuances.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arvid" title="Arvid"><img alt="Arvid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arvid">Arvid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300676/#Comment_300676" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-13T08:22:56+00:00" title="November 13, 2010  8:22AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is some great support, thanks Eero!<br/><br/>Yeah, I see what you're getting at, I should definitely identify the leverage (loyalty, lies, lasers or promises) before allowing social manipulation rolls at all. Good call.<br/><br/>What I'm looking to allow is not so much an expert in threatening, as much as characters who just aren't as good at being diplomatic, and vice versa, characters who just aren't rough enough to have another ship back down with the autocarbines, but are very smooth and careful in non-confrontational negotiations.<br/><br/>Hm. Could I just allow players to use different pools for the same ability check, depending on circumstances? Or is that a no-no in Solar System design? I imagine said letnev, without much contacts and community pool to draw from, could draw on his resources as a tough guy. Perhaps the community pool is smaller and more powerful to balance. And a Secret of Charm for characters who are smooth enough to temprarily sway others to their cause... They light be pissed of at you once they wisen up, of course!<br/><br/>I think a multicultural ship can actually be a boon for lifting cultural issues, bringing in families, traditions and loyalties of each character. If we focus on, say, two cultures, with two or three perifery ones, we get an attachment to most of them. I'm thinking mainly the human-like ones with one weird one thrown into the mix, so not total cultural bonanza. Maybe a lone Xxcha on the space station, or a ship of Muuat, but just as colour, not as a consequential part of the world. Perhaps it is something of a unique thing, a crosscultural crew. What do you think? I might get them all to play mentak as well. Would a single culture be more powerful? I think that multiculturalism is a storywise powerful thing in a traditional world.<br/><br/>The story of the boardgame is, the mighty and enlightened Lazax race brought all the cultures of the galaxy together into a mighty empire, sharing the secrets of interstellar travel. It was a golden age that ended with the animosity between the cultures leading to all-out civil war. Mecatol Rex and the lazax people was destroyed. The empire broken, a time of darkness and isolation followed. The game starts as the different cultures once more venture into space. Everyone is hoping for a new golden age, but everyone also wants to claim Mecatol's throne for their own. Only one culture can rule as an enlightened dynasty.<br/><br/>There are legends, hyperadvanced relics, and maybe even a few survivors from the lazax civilization, which the game describes in a venerating, almost mystical way. Some cultures mention religion: The destiny-searching clan of Saar, the fanatical Yin Brotherhood, all clones from their creator. The Hacan emirates has a spiritual element to their goods, and one of their planets are described as a centre for their spirituality. There's the Sardakk N'orr who venerate their hive mother, whom outsiders question the very existence of. There are also the winnarian beuraucrats, nurturing the old traditions from the age of lazax. Oh, and there are THINGS in the wormholes.<br/><br/>All in all, I get the impression that the inhabitants of the galaxy are not strangers to religion, legends and mysticism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arvid" title="Arvid"><img alt="Arvid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arvid">Arvid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300677/#Comment_300677" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-13T08:34:20+00:00" title="November 13, 2010  8:34AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pardon my writing, I scribbled this down on my iPhone. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308323/#Comment_308323" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-14T20:40:29+00:00" title="January 14, 2011  8:40PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark Causey</cite>I ran a Firefly style game a while back, pretty successful.

Yay!<br/><br/>It got down to the afternoon and people were trying to disperse. I persuaded them otherwise and I think it was worth it. It was Shane, Andy, Ara and I. We looked through Andy's pile of games and chose to play The Shadow of Yesterday (as I'd promised Shane I'd show him how to run it "behind the curtain"). Only one problem: I didn't know the setting of TSoY well enough to pitch and get buy-in for any given section of it. So, I cast about like I do for Primetime Adventures games - I start asking people what media they've seen recently and enjoyed. We landed on Firefly and Serenity.<br/><br/>First thing I did after that was to rename the Pools. I always find that new Pool names really help people get into a common language for the setting. We ended up with Guts for Vigor, Wiles for Instinct and Smarts for Reason. I renamed XP "shiny" and had people mark up their character sheets with these new words. I think it also helped people start getting into the mood of the game. They knew they'd be Gutsy, Wily and Smart.<br/><br/>Abilities are a problem for chargen in a one-shot/con scenario for me because there are too many. So, I decided to recast fifteen of them (plus the defensive ones making eighteen) and gave five to each Pool:<br/><br/>Guts: Scrapping, Guns, Zero-G, Riding, Hard Work, Endure*<br/>Wiles: Savoir-Faire, Sway, Piloting, Bureaucracy, Gambling, React*<br/>Smarts: Engineering, Deceit, Computers, Doctoring, Haggling, Resist*<br/><br/>* - Note that, due to the renaming of the Pools, the defensive Abilities had to change allegiance.<br/><br/>*** Here is where I stopped previously. The facts now become hazy. ***<br/><br/>We made standard characters at that point, except that I had them choose two or three Keys and one Secret. One Key for each character had to be linked to another character, though. I had them basically describe what kind of cool feature they wanted for a Secret and built something on the spot. I wanted to reduce page turning/choice paralysis. Luckily I wrote down the concepts, names, Keys and Secrets, but unluckily only in shorthand. I also asked for defining features of their homeworld and would give them situational bonuses if they were interacting in or needed an Ability roll from something like their homeworld.<br/><br/>Soldier/Pilot | Dash Ortiz | Low Tech/Agricultural Planet | Keys: Edge, Adventure, Guardian | Secret: Ignore Harm (Shane)<br/>Courtesan | So-Jung Bishop | Core Planet, Wealthy | Keys: Dark Secret,  Mission, Fraternity - Dash | Secret: Kung Fu (Andy)<br/>Engineer | Anderson | Core Planet, Hive (?) | Keys: Fraternity - Dash, Conscience | Secret: Super Engineering (Ara)<br/><br/>We created an NPC, Sally. She was a sharpshooter and a fixer. We decided to start in media res, with the group being part of a not quite legal salvaging ship who's current salvage just went to shit because a micrometeor just pegged their captain in the head as he was returning via the line with some cargo AND a police ship just showed up out of the nearby planet's shadow. We called the show Horizon and started roleplaying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
