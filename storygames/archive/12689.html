There's a million doctor show episodes to tap into, plus my own experience in the medical field and medical thrillers.  The recent novel "Beat the Reaper", about a hitman-turned-intern in a crumbling inner city hospital, was pretty inspiring too.  Any thoughts about how to construct a good playset?  There must be more to it than just taking the skeleton of another playset like "The Ice" and changing the details, right?  <br/><br/>I was thinking about having categories for "Diseases", "Patients", and "Crises" as well as Needs and Objects.  Is that too much special effects?  It seems that relationships are the meat of the playset, and they need to be tweaked as well.  Any suggestions?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285103/#Comment_285103" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T05:53:32+00:00" title="August 10, 2010  5:53AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Daniel,<br/><br/>There's some general advice on creating playsets in the book, on page 60.  I think a hospital Fiasco sounds promising, especially if you've got some ready knowledge in that area.  My suggestion would be to focus on the Location and Object tables, using them to create cinematic color appropriate to your setting.  Change the Relationships and Needs as well, though many of them won't need to be changed much (Family, for example).<br/><br/>Changing a whole set of Details (turning Locations into Diseases, for example) is totally fine- you'll just need to test it and see what effect it would have on play.  In that example, game-play would become very specific and focused on the disease that gets pulled into play.  In order to keep the balance of fun, I probably wouldn't mess with more than one set of Details at a time, but that's just me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285104/#Comment_285104" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T06:09:50+00:00" title="August 10, 2010  6:09AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2010 6:11AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Turning Objects into Diagnosis would totally work.

But you could have "Disease and Diagnosis" and "Objects and Locations" in addition to Relationships and Needs. The ones that are normally Object and Location are inspirational color, so you could differentiate within each, with three categories of disease and three of diagnosis for example. In a five player game you could end up with one of each. I think hospital physical color  - trauma bays, drug dispensers, surgical robots, cafeterias, etc. - is important to help set the tone and ground the action.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285722/#Comment_285722" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-12T07:24:46+00:00" title="August 12, 2010  7:24AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I were doing this, I'd probably make a Diseases and Diagnoses subcategories of Objects.
