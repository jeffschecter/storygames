I'm thinking of codifying the more dramatic ways you and your buddy can end up in a bind.  The sort of bind that would result in lies and paranoia and eventually cutting up bodies out by the old fish house.  First your motivation:<br/><br/>Obligation:  You and your buddy share a burden.<br/>Ambition:  You share a goal.  <br/>Compulsion:  You share a need.<br/><br/>(Am I missing a powerful motivation?)<br/><br/>Then the thing you are either beholden to or pursuing:<br/><br/>Money (a debt, a windfall)<br/>Status (Fame, power, respect)<br/>Freedom (for yourself, for another, from a responsibility)<br/>Knowledge (The truth, a secret)<br/>Companionship (sex, love, friendship)<br/>Passion (revenge, justice, lust)<br/><br/>Anything missing?  "Freedom" seems weak.  "Companionship" isn't the right word.  Thanks for your low-stakes dirty small town thoughts.

Something like "You share blood," maybe?  You know, like, your brother-in-law killed some poor sucker by accident on a hunting trip and now you have to help hide the body so he doesn't go to prison and leave your alcoholic sister with no one to take care of her or the kids.

So I'm envisioning a roleplaying game where you create a circle of overlapping affiliations, then inject trouble into those affiliations, then step back and see what happens.<br/><br/>So it's me, you, and Joel playing.<br/><br/>Me and you are brother and sister.  You and Joel are doctor and patient.  Joel and I are rivals.  We build a relationship map out of that information, then we add trouble - in this case, maybe Joel and I - rivals - have a goal related to money somehow.  Maybe we're competing for some windfall - we decide.  My guy's sister is Joel's guy's doctor, and he's going to use her to get me to back off.

That gives you 3 'positive' motivations - you love it, you're good at it, it's your goal.  And 3 'negative' ones - you're obligated, you're afraid, and you can't help it.  Though one or two could cross over.  Very good.<br/>\nWould you consider regret?  It is sort of similar to shame but not the same.  <br/>\nRedemption could also work I think.  You're doing it to right a wrong or return your honor or get right with God.<br/>\nHow about 'because it's the right thing to do' as a motivation?  Your example of a bind (cutting up bodies by the old fish house) suggests that there are accepted morals in the game or in general.  This would be particularly the case in a small town.  And those could flux with the setting/game/people playing.  Maybe in this town it's not ok to drive around at night whacking people with aluminum ball bats (hence the need to cut them up by the old fish house).  But down the road folks consider that a Sunday after church good time (cutting them up at the old fish house included in that fun. Heck, bring some lawn chairs and your coolers.  We'll set up the grill, set up the horseshoes stakes and play with their shoes.  It'll be a big ole time.)<br/>\nThis is a cool exercise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169790/#Comment_169790" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-18T04:24:31+00:00" title="September 18, 2008  4:24AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks guys, I'm thinking.

Another movie that seems to fit the genre (though the geography ranges a bit) is No Country For Old Men, though I might just be thinking of that since you've already got Fargo and Burn After Reading on the list.<br/><br/>One thing I noted from the list of motivations you have so far is that some of them are a bit different. So, for example, Get out or Get the truth can be very general: the truth about what? from whom? get out from what situation? On the other hand, get laid seems kind of direct. There's some room for variation, but it seems like you'll pretty much end up doing the same thing. I'm wondering if it could be replaced with something more general? I want to say 'get pleasure' since it seems like the root here is a kind of hedonistic pleasure, but that would overlap too much with, well, everything else. It breaks the naming pattern, but "have fun" is what it seems like to me, or "make your mark."<br/><br/>It's probably too late for more now, but writing this I thought of one more: "Get noticed." You want to get someone's attention, maybe your removed father, the College football talent scout, or the hot girl in chem class.<br/><br/>Edit: Never mind, "get noticed" is probably just a slight generalization of "get respect." Slightly different meaning, but close enough.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170174/#Comment_170174" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T13:27:02+00:00" title="September 19, 2008  1:27PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Get noticed" could be a way to pack "get respect" and "get laid" into just one item of the bullet list.

Here's the extended example of engineerig the initial fiasco I'm using:<br/><br/><i>It's ME, MONA, JEFF, and JOEL, sitting around a table in that order.  </i><br/><br/>ME:  What\u2019s the setting?<br/><br/>MONA:  Let\u2019s use \u201cSouthern Town.\u201d<br/><br/>JOEL:  Sounds good.  Why don\u2019t we set it in \u2026 let\u2019s see \u2026 Robin Hood, North Carolina.<br/><br/>JEFF:  I like that, it already sounds off-kilter.  OK, roll the dice.<br/><br/><i>(I roll all sixteen dice.  They come up 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, and 6).  </i><br/><br/>ME:  Who grew up in the smallest town?  Not me.<br/><br/>JEFF:  Not me either.  Joel?  Mona?<br/><br/>JOEL:  5000 people.<br/><br/>MONA:  You win.  You go first, Joel.<br/><br/>JOEL:  Excellent.  I see there\u2019s only one five, and I definitely want a crime Relationship, so I\u2019ll take that.<br/><br/><i>(Joel places the die between us \u2013 he and I will have a criminal Relationship.)</i><br/><br/>ME:  I\u2019m next.  How about a work Relationship between Jeff and Mona?<br/><br/><i>(I place a two die between them.)</i><br/><br/>MONA:  Work, huh?  All right.  I\u2019ll take a one and make us former co-workers.  Where and how, we don\u2019t know yet.<br/><br/>JEFF:  That\u2019ll come.  I want some community involvement here.  I\u2019ll take a six.<br/><br/><i>(JEFF puts the six between himself and me.)</i><br/><br/>Joel, your turn.<br/><br/>JOEL:  Right, nobody touched my criminal Relationship with Jason, so I\u2019m going to grab another six and declare it a drug thing.  Meth, I think.<br/><br/>ME:  Sounds great.  Let\u2019s be a skeezy husband and wife team!<br/><br/>JOEL:  Absolutely.  <br/><br/>ME:  My turn, and I\u2019m going for the Relationship between Joel and Jeff.  I\u2019ll take a one, family.<br/><br/>MONA:  Nice.  Let\u2019s just finish that up.  How about in-laws?  <br/><br/><i>(MONA takes a one.)<br/></i><br/>JEFF:  I like that.  Joel, what if I was the meth cooker\u2019s father-in-law?<br/><br/>ME:  That\u2019d make me his daughter!  <br/><br/>JOEL:  Awesome.  Can your guy be the town doctor?<br/><br/>JEFF:  Definitely.  And this is getting good \u2013 I want a weapon to get between the doctor and his son-in-law.  <br/><br/><i>(JEFF takes a three.  JOEL, next in rotation, immediately grabs a one.)</i><br/><br/>JOEL:  A shotgun.  It\u2019s a short-barreled pump.  Of course I\u2019m paranoid as hell, and I keep it around the house.  It\u2019s a point of tension between me and my wife\u2019s dad.  <br/><br/>ME:  I\u2019m going to throw down the three there, as a Need for me and Joel.  We Need to get rich, obviously.  So what do we have?<br/><br/>MONA:  A creepy pair of shotgun-toting meth addicts, the wife is the black sheep of her high-class family.<br/><br/>JEFF:  Her father\u2019s the town doctor, and he wants to make good with his son-in-law and maybe help him out, but he\u2019s scared of him. <br/><br/>MONA:  OK, time to up the ante.  I\u2019m putting down the last six as a Need between my guy, as yet unknown, and Jason\u2019s meth princess.  Somebody Needs to get laid.<br/><br/>JOEL:  I love it.<br/><br/>JEFF:  Maybe he\u2019s a businessman.  I\u2019ll use that one to add a Location to Jason and Mona\u2019s Relationship \u2013 Downtown, on the north side of Center Road.  <br/><br/>JOEL:  I\u2019ll take the three and make that Royall\u2019s Drug Store.<br/><br/>MONA:  Sweet.  He\u2019s the pharmacist.  <br/><br/>JEFF:  We used to work together at the regional hospital.<br/><br/>MONA:  Right.  And he was a classmate of the meth-heads back in high school.<br/><br/>ME:  Maybe we dated.<br/><br/>MONA:  Oh!  Jason, take that four and put it in our Relationship, making the Need \u201cto get laid by a former lover, to rekindle the flame.\u201d  <br/><br/>ME:  Oh hell yes.  <br/><br/>MONA:  We were engaged before I went off to college.  My straight-arrow pharmacist never got over you.<br/><br/><i>(I take the four.)</i><br/><br/>MONA:  We still need to know how I\u2019m currently connected to the Meth princess, and how you guys are going to get rich.  I\u2019ll take the two and put it in your Need \u2013 you losers Need to get rich by robbing a business.  I think we all know whose business that is going to be.<br/><br/>JEFF:  Cool.  That leaves the other two to explain how the meth princess and the pharmacist know each other \u2013 it\u2019s already community, and now you guys are civic volunteers.  <br/><br/>ME:  I may have fallen, but I still have connections to the respectable community.  I teach youth group!  We teach youth group at Peace Haven church together.<br/><br/>MONA:  That\u2019s agony.  I love it.<br/><br/>ME:  And I\u2019m acting really sweet to you, giving you signals, buttering you up, because we are going to fucking rob your pharmacy.  <br/><br/>MONA:  I guess that Need to get laid is sort of one-way, huh?<br/><br/>ME:  Indeed, but we\u2019re both going to suffer for it I suspect.  Everybody happy with this?<br/><br/>JEFF:  It seems like my doctor is a little removed from the action.<br/><br/>JOEL:  True, he doesn\u2019t have a Need, but he\u2019s got strong connections to everybody else and there\u2019s always that shotgun. <br/><br/>JEFF:  Good point, Joel.  I bet it won\u2019t be long before he\u2019s in the thick of things.<br/><br/>ME:  Let\u2019s play!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
