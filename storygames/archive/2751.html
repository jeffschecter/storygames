Hopefully this will also allow me to do much more in depth AP posts from my con games (with everyone's permission of course).<br/>\n<br/>\nIs anyone using such a device.  Is the built in microphone generally good enough, or is there a better conference style mic that you know about?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy set up is  a iRiver T30 from newegg.com which was only $40, and I could add a mic like an AudioTechnica ATR-97 ($23.95) or a Sony (either the ECM-F8 ($15) or the ECM-F01($50)) to it if need be.  I was hoping the podcasting folks would have some advice on this, but most of the on-line stuff I've found has been for uni-direcitonal interview mics, not omni-directional one built to pick up a whole table of folks.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny tips, tricks, gotchas folks can impart.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62790/#Comment_62790" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-03T12:21:26+00:00" title="April  3, 2007 12:21PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will add that I am also very interested in this.<br/><br/>I want to record a session in a way where:<br/><br/>1) Everyone can be heard<br/><br/>2) Minimize risk of the mp3 player simply shutting off without anyone realizing it.<br/><br/>So, just here to lurk and watch for responses.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62795/#Comment_62795" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-03T12:37:13+00:00" title="April  3, 2007 12:37PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a camera that has a record function, but it does seem to shut off by itself occasionally.

You're also on the right track with an omnidirectional mic; the binaural thing is probably 87 times more complicated than you (or anyone) really need (and playback only works with headphones; it's not designed for room speakers or mono). Just put the ATR-97 in the middle of your gaming table and record away.<br/><br/>You should probably test the recorder's built-in mic the same way and see how it fares. Since your main purpose is to capture sessions for your own use, not broadcast, it may be all you need.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PoundFool" title="PoundFool"><img alt="PoundFool" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/93/buddyicons/78471072@N00.jpg?1156208500"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PoundFool">PoundFool</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63144/#Comment_63144" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-06T12:51:34+00:00" title="April  6, 2007 12:51PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been interested in the effect that recording sessions has on the games.<br/><br/>Being recorded as player, I felt on the one hand constantly aware of the device and not as able to get into the flow of the game, and on the other fascinated by listening to the session some time afterwards and learning things like how often I was not, I guess, just not paying attention to the words of the other players.

The memory will hold 4-6 hours easily.<br/><br/>The software can save the files into WAV, and I will eventually use Audacity to edit the poop jokes out. <br/><br/>It's rather pricey ($50-60), but very useful in a variety of situations -- for instance, I've done several interviews with it for the Fnordcast.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
