I hope you'll see fit to do a Bite-Sized AP!<br/><br/>I had two really fun games on Sunday, one using Manna Hotel, the other using Objective Zebra. Each had something to teach me. Our Manna Hotel game didn't bring in any of the Lynchian elements, and instead wound up being a crime drama set in a nowhere town, like the Coen Brothers in their darker moods. This was my third Manna game, and I was surprised to see how gracefully it became a genre-light, kitchen sink drama playset when none of the "Need: To gain respect... through the subtle exercise of mystic powers"-type elements were chosen.<br/><br/>The Zebra game was unusual among my Fiasco games for letting me get into an actor mode. I usually don't get out from behind the camera when we play, preferring to script and direct more, but I got to play a cultist, and it's been a long time since I've gotten to do that. I was reminded that I kind of miss GMing Cthulhu, and may have to do that again sometime soon. Sorry if I got a little hammy, guys! Such are my instincts in these cases. Anyway, I think I'll make a concerted effort to try doing that more often, because it really was a blast.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354711/#Comment_354711" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T12:23:53+00:00" title="January 17, 2012 12:23PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            EndGame has long supported story games (and really is an amazing store).

Thanks Sean for getting this organized!<br/><br/>Even though I missed the afternoon session on Sunday, I got in a two-hour improv in gaming workshop and two sessions of Fiasco (Transatlantic and DC1973).<br/><br/>I've done a decent bit of improv in the past few years, but Mia, Karen and Matt really found some useful and relevant improv games for storytelling and "letting go". Most of which I hadn't played before. I found it hugely useful and can't wait to see more events like it.<br/><br/>Oh, and having Steve and Jason there didn't suck either. Only drawback is that I will never be invited to play Until We Sink again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354713/#Comment_354713" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T12:37:19+00:00" title="January 17, 2012 12:37PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: daw65</cite>Chuck McWilliams, disgraced ex-Wolf Den Keeper of the ex-Brookhaven Zoo.</blockquote>PETA has a long, long memory, Mr. McWilliams. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Caesar_X</cite>Only drawback is that I will never be invited to play Until We Sink again.</blockquote>Oh god, that evil laugh!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354714/#Comment_354714" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T12:38:44+00:00" title="January 17, 2012 12:38PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Steve Segedy</cite><br/><cite>Posted By: Caesar_X</cite>Only drawback is that I will never be invited to play Until We Sink again.</blockquote>Oh god, that evil laugh!<br/>GAH                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354725/#Comment_354725" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T13:21:17+00:00" title="January 17, 2012  1:21PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This was a jealousy-inducing event that I long to replicate in the Midwest.

The dubious incentive was that the top can-bringers got to play at my table, and it turns out that people who bring a lot of cans also tend to be excellent Fiasco players. I thought this worked well and would suggest wrapping in some tangible community benefit/competitive perk to this sort of event.<br/><br/>The other sessions had facilitators randomly assigned, which worked fine. We juggled a little, splitting a couple of 5-person tables into more 3-person tables and so on. Everyone was very mellow and the general atmosphere was positive and energetic. Everyone I played with was great. <br/><br/>Playing after a brain exploding improv workshop was fantastic. I felt more "on" and more excited than usual, having just had a physical and mental workout thanks to Mia, Karen and Matthew. <br/><br/>The timing was perfect for both parts - a couple of three hour slots. We had half a dozen top-notch facilitators for each session and I could pick out players I could've grabbed to run a table if necessary, too.<br/><br/>One Fiasco-y thing that took me by surprise - a lot of use of the soft tilt and aftermath. Not sure why, but two out of three of my games, and plenty I eavesdropped on, were using the soft tables.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354740/#Comment_354740" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T14:45:49+00:00" title="January 17, 2012  2:45PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite>Player organization was handled in a pleasingly meta way - structured freeform, if you will.

Numbered tables had been set up while we were out at lunch, and you just grabbed a table of 3 people max, until there was overflow (at least two had four players).  The facilitators, which consisted mostly of the organizers plus Jason and Steve, drew numbers and grabbed a table. There was a bit of a cafeteria feeling at first (which table is the cool table?) but, for me, it was more because I knew more than a handful of people and would have been happy sitting with any of them.

A local just needs to take the lead on organizing and publicizing. It needs:<br/><br/>1. A location, probably a game store with lots of space, and a date a few months out.<br/>2. An improvisation instructor.<br/>3. Publicity and enthusiasm.<br/>4. A way for people to sign up and pay. <br/>5. Improv-savvy minions and facilitators, probably the same people, some of whom may be participants anyway.<br/><br/>The instructor needs to get an honorarium and if you want me to come I need a plane ticket. Endgame was very generous in donating their space but other stores may not have the same kind heart.<br/><br/>I'm sure Sean, Karen, Mia and Chris would be happy to offer advice as well!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355023/#Comment_355023" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-19T14:50:16+00:00" title="January 19, 2012  2:50PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the writeup!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
