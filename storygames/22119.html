It\u2019s a successful cinematic technique, but would it work in a game?<br/><br/>Does anybody have any experience or examples with this? Does it work? Does it fail? What is good about it and what is bad?<br/><br/>These are my thoughts so far, but I have not tested any of them:<br/><br/>* I think it could work in PbtA playbooks with specific moves for specific roles. Like replace the Alignments moves/rewards in Dungeon World with FMB-positions? (Perhaps they could even change, depending on episodes or spin-offs!)<br/>* It might kinda be a bit present in Lady Blackbird, built in, but nothing seems to steer you into playing that way, right?<br/>* I was thinking on restricting the Fate Aspect creation with a position in mind.<br/>* I\u2019ve made a pre-generated sci-fi cast for a stranded spaceship game I want to someday run in RISUS. (It\u2019s in Dutch though, so I\u2019d have to translate it while it\u2019s not finished yet, and most of the names are language based puns) I applied it on this cast and it works very well. I think it creates a nice starting position for play, but I\u2019m not sure if something like this would organically emerge unless it\u2019s written in the character generation rules. (which is easily adjusted in RISUS with a more narrow definition of Hooks and Tales.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485037/#Comment_485037" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T14:44:40+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  2:44PM">June 3</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I understand the basic idea of a \u201cfive man band\u201d, but not what kind of gameplay you\u2019re hoping to get out of the idea.<br/><br/>Maybe we should start with \u201chow does Lady Blackbird fail in this regard, for you?\u201d                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neurotrash" title="Neurotrash"><img alt="Neurotrash" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neurotrash">Neurotrash</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485042/#Comment_485042" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T15:30:32+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  3:30PM">June 3</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2019 3:31PM by Neurotrash.">edited June 3</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've messed around with designing around the idea in the past (as well as some of the other <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastCalculus" rel="nofollow">Cast Calculus</a> concepts found on TVTropes) but I always end up frustrated.<br/><br/>I think one of the main problems with the concept is that it isn't completely based on one kind of character delineation.<br/><br/>The "Big Guy" and the "Smart Guy" are straight-up descriptions of ability/specialization. The sort of thing D&amp;D classes measure. The Smart Guy is going to be good at knowledge skills and tech/magic (depending on genre) and the Big Guy is going to be tough, strong, and good at fighting. Easy to model with traditional RPG stats. They say nothing about personality, relationships, interpersonal conflict, character flaws, etc. The Big guys is probably not very smart and the Smart Guy is probably not very strong, but those are just skills and abilities, not personality traits.<br/><br/>"The Leader" though. What's that character good at? Maybe social skills, but that's not necessarily intrinsic to the type. They're pretty much just the "Main Protagonist", which can be awkward and clumsy in a group setting where traditionally everyone has their own niche and plot importance. The Leader is defined by his relationship to the rest of the group and the plot, not what he can do. Still, you could probably load him up with inspiration-type mechanics and maybe some social skills. Not an impossible thing to design around. <br/><br/>The main problem with the Leader is that the archetype is usually kind of boring. Who's favorite Ninja Turtle is Leonardo? NOBODY! He doesn't do anything! If you're looking at it from a more Buffy Summers or Luke Skywalker angle, now you've got one player who the entire game is "about" and everyone else is just supporting characters. Some groups are gonna be fine with that. Others aren't. It's tricky.<br/><br/>"The Lancer" - This character is entirely based around "not being the Leader". What do you do with that? You could maybe make the Leader player and the Lancer player pick from the same suite of skills or between two packages where neither can pick the same thing, so if the leader picks the "Thief" package the Lancer gets the "Cleric" package and vice versa. <br/><br/>The main problem with the Lancer is you're going to get the "great, Wolverine is going off on his own again..." problem. If you're designing a "group of heroes works together to solve a problem" kind of game (which is what most 5-man-band stories are about), this is going to end up causing a lot of inter-character conflict, splitting the group, etc.<br/><br/>"The Chick (Heart)" - Where do I start? It's an archetype entirely based around gender? Entirely based around managing the interpersonal relationships of the group? How do you design around that in a task-oriented game? What do you give "The Heart" that you didn't already give "The Leader?"<br/><br/>So all of the above is assuming a "group of heroes working together to fight evil or something" scenario where you're focusing on what the characters can do. If you're trying to create a game around interpersonal conflict, or who the characters "are", you get the opposite problem. It becomes much easier to model the Leader and the Lancer and the Heart with bonds or Hx or keys or strings or what have you, but then what do you do with the Big Guy and the Smart Guy? What are they about in this kind of game? What is their conflict with the others? What's their role?<br/><br/>This is just my first load of thoughts on the subject. I've wanted to make something based on the concept for a while, because obviously it resonates, but I've never really gotten around what the roles "mean" in relationship to the mechanics.<br/><br/>As far as Lady Blackbird how do they map?<br/><br/>Lady Blackbird - Leader or Heart?<br/>Naomi Bishop - Big Guy<br/>Cyrus Vance - Leader or Lancer?<br/>Kale Arkham - Smart Guy or Heart or Lancer?<br/>Snargle - Heart or Smart Guy?<br/><br/>The Keys give some clues, but they don't really map one-to-one, in my opinion. It might be the closest thing I've seen in an RPG though.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_485051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/The_Bearded_Belgian" title="The_Bearded_Belgian"><img alt="The_Bearded_Belgian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The_Bearded_Belgian">The_Bearded_Belgian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485051/#Comment_485051" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T16:31:56+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  4:31PM">June 3</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Neurotrash">@Neurotrash</a> basically has the same views I have. Except that I don't really play skill-based games, but more games based around archetypes (FATE, RISUS, etc.) in which I kind of like to try and use tropes.<br/><br/>As for Lady Blackbird: I think the genius thing is that it kinda blurs the lines of the archetypes, but it also kind of depends on how they are played.<br/><br/>In my head Vance is the <b>Leader</b>, most of the time.<br/><b>Lancer</b> could be filled by Kale through the lens of a loyal friend challenging his friend out of genuine friendship. It could be Naomi, being protective of Natasha, not trusting Vance.<br/>It could be Natasha herself, in a healthy, playful rivalry.<br/><b>Heart</b> is basically Snargle. Their Key of Compassion seems written explicitly to fill that role.<br/><b>Big Guy</b> is also completely what Naomi seems to be built for, though I have people seen playing Snargle like that too. And Natasha with her impressive sorcerous powers could be a candidate as well.<br/><b>Smart guy</b> ... well, Kale has his street smarts, which is basically the role smarts will have to play for a smuggler. Snargle could be smart in the wits departement, which is his other strong suit. But Natasha, being an educated noble, might fulfill that role, though I don't think anything on her character sheet points to that...<br/><br/>Anyway, I don't think it's failing. It's maybe not even designed to represent it, so in that way of thinking there's no success or failure. But yeah, if it would qualify ... I dunno.<br/><br/>But yeah, I agree with Neurotrash that the Leader role kinda wants to hog the spotlight, which isn't much fun for other players, which is why I've been thinking about making it a role that can switch characters, maybe per story-arc or episode. And I'm not quite sure how yet.<br/><br/>I'm thinking it might be a reward-based play? <br/>At the start of the arc/chapter/session everyone chooses a role. They cannot choose a role they've chosen last arc. There then would be story beats that get rewarded in an end of session move, kind of like Dungeon World, but each role has separate built in goals. The Leader makes decisions, the Lancer challenges the leader, the Heart keeps everyone together or is empathic, the Smart Guy suggests a plan, the Big Guy shows of their strength. Kinda like that, but maybe more worked out.<br/><br/>"When you put the team before yourself, take XP", stuff like that. Maybe it doesn't replace end-of-session, but alignment or something?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_485053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/485053/#Comment_485053" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-03T16:40:52+00:00" title="June  3, 2019  4:40PM">June 3</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Overall, I think there\u2019s a danger of putting the cart before the horse here.<br/><br/>What do we gain by using a structure like this - one that I\u2019m sure the original stories/writers were not thinking of consciously, but was used to label those stories and templates after the fact?<br/><br/>(Serious question!
