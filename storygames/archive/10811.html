With all the talk about video training demos for indie games, this seemed particularly relevant. Seeing this, I could imagine a bizarre parallel universe where people with head mics, trained staff, cool toys and prizes were holding training sessions for Princes' Kingdom or Mouse Guard. :P<br/><br/>Granted, it's easier to teach a card/action figure game with an animated series and a devoted cult following among kids, but it's fun to imagine. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
