                    So, this is taken from the "What Don't You Get About RPGs" thread.<br/><br/>The question raised was:<br/>What would a RPG look like that didn't portray the PCs (or all the PCs) as the protagonists?<br/><br/>I have a fairly vested interest in this, because in Boulevard (my game of Punk Rock Tragedy) it's becoming obvious that the characters aren't often protagonists. I'm reading Requiem for a Dream right now. It's a version put out at the same time the movie was being shot, and director Darren Aronofsky wrote one of the forewords, and in it he wrote:
<blockquote>The novel had amazing structure and it translated very well into three acts. But something was strange. While breaking it down I realized that whenever something good was supposed to happen to a character, something bad happened. Because of this, I couldn't figure out who the hero of the novel was.<br/><br/>After sketching out all the character arcs I realized they were all upside down. So I flipped them over, and suddenly I had a "Eureka!" The hero wasn't Sara, it wasn't Harry, not Tyrone, not Marion.<br/><br/>The hero was the characters' enemy: Addiction. The book is a manifesto on Addiction's triumph over the Human Spirit.</blockquote>
First of all, he's right. Addiction is the protagonist.<br/><br/>Second of all, that's what Boulevard is sorta like. The PCs lose. That's an intrinsic part of the game. Their addictions, causes, places, and failures consume them and move on. Being destroyed is hard-coded into the game.<br/><br/>So... are the players ACTUALLY playing Addiction, Despair, Circumstance and other such concepts? Are they playing a protagonist at all?<br/>...does a game where the PCs aren't protagonists simply devolve into a shit-kicking session, where players beat fictional characters to death?                </div>

                            Have you played Universalis?  That's the closest I've seen to a game where the PCs weren't protagonists, but rather elements in a story soup. Might want to give it a shot sometime (there's a lot of groups that play it online).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Would my initial notes for <i>The Ballad of Saucy Jack</i> count? The players are old salts, recounting the stories of the larger-than-life pirate heros who they once served grog to or served under as a powder monkey. In the "now" portion of the game, the characters are the protagonists with vested interest in seeing their character become the most respected of the tavern drunks. Within the stories though, the hero is this great, grand pirate hero. All of the lesser characters are just trying to get by.<br/><br/>That is not as metaphysical as you described, but I think that it fits the characters into the same role of pawns. They tell their stories, but they end up revealing more about the hero than them. The characters are more like frame narratives than actual types who we expect to grow and change.<br/><br/>In Boulevard, are the players expected to go through several characters in quick succession?                        </div>

                            Joe, there's more than one way to define protagonist, and I think you've just identified a situation where some definitions work and others don't.  If a protagonist is "the guy who is beset by adversity but triumphs in the end" then your PCs aren't protagonists by that definition.  But protagonists can also be "the guy that the audience empathizes with" and in that sense, the PCs are most certainly protagonists.                        </div>

Last night, me and Kirk Mitchell hashed out this idea for an hour or more. Here is what I mean to be talking about:<br/><br/><b>In Boulevard, the characters lack agency.</b><br/><br/>They aren't able to genuinely make decisions. They things they create are bigger than they are. They things they are a part of can grow to consume them. They are robbed of empowerment. They are largely defined by circumstance.<br/><br/>At some points, they become little more than the things they are fighting for. Jonathan ceases to be Jonathan. All he is now is East Hastings Street, mixed in with a little bit of Neo-Nazism. Thomas becomes consumed by his heroin addiction, and for a while there is no Thomas. There is just heroin.<br/><br/>At other points, they seem to gain control of the steering wheel. They have a moment of clarity, and of agency. And shit gets really dangerous at that moment. People die. Hearts get broken. Buildings get blown up. Addictions start. Damage Control is out the window.<br/><br/>So, here's the thing: In Boulevard, there is a cap gun on the table, with a single cap in it. Russian Roulette is the only chance mechanic in the game.<br/>The cap gun represents agency. It's something that the characters struggle for, even if they don't realize that.<br/><br/>Making the things around them bigger and more deadly, that gains them resources.<br/><br/>When the character does have a moment where they have a "real shot", the player grabs the gun. You're playing with (gun)fire now, boy. You might get your way in this moment, but it involves pointing a fucking gun at the things you love.<br/><br/>So, that's the thing. The characters aren't heroes. They aren't anti-heroes either, really. They are just non-heroes.<br/>The things they are, are bigger than them. The decisions they make aren't genuinely theirs. They lack agency.<br/>I like Darren Aronofsky's passage in my first post enough to reference it again now. Re-read it. The characters are not the heroes. The things that destroy them are.<br/><b><br/>Now, my original question, revised:<br/><br/>1.) If the characters have little to no agency, are the players REALLY playing characters? Or are they actually playing Forces?<br/>2.) Can you play a character without agency or an ultimate victory, without it turning into a merciless shit-kicking session?<br/>3.) Is it a realistic goal for me to ask people to be sympathetic to someone they realize they will destroy?</b><br/><br/>In light of Question 2, I want to point to My Life with Master.<br/>In light of Question 3, I'd like to point to my source material: Fight Club, Requiem for a Dream, SLC Punk!, Invisible Monsters, The Doom Generation, punk culture in general, Disco Pigs, Taxi Driver, Trainspotting.                        </div>

                            Going by the definition of a protagonist as someone who wants something<br/>
and is taking action to get it--<br/>
<br/>
I've been messing with the idea of the protagonist being an NPC who is<br/>
defined entirely by what they want at any given moment of play. And<br/>
the rest of the party then defines themselves in relation to that motive.<br/>
<br/>
To explain this I usually use Luke Skywalker, because he's easy to see<br/>
as blank-- not very deep-- beyond a series of impulses that he chases:<br/>
wants to finish his chores and go to town/ attend the academy/<br/>
find the escaped droid/ check on his aunt and uncle/ escape Tattoine/<br/>
save the princess/ learn about the Force.       Also, it's easy to convince<br/>
players that playing Han Solo or Obi Wan or Darth Vader-- isn't a booby<br/>
prize compared to getting to play the 'official' protagonist.<br/>
<br/>
Scene framing would begin with the players brainstorming possible current motives<br/>
for the protagonist NPC, and then using a combination of bidding and fortune<br/>
to determine which motive is played. (So that the highest bid is favored, but<br/>
a lucky roll could let a lower bid prevail.)   Then each player controls their<br/>
own PC's relation to the protagonist's trajectory.<br/>
<br/>
This ought to work like a cross country game of 'fetch'.   The pack agrees which<br/>
way to throw the 'stick'.  Then everybody decides whether to help chase it or<br/>
whether to impede progress.  Repeat across varying terrain.  The immediate<br/>
goal of the story should always be clear, as should the over-arching story direction.<br/>
<br/>
I know that the "GM PC" is a much hated railroading device.  I hope to avoid that by<br/>
keeping the protagonist as an empty shell/ and distributing his direction ouija-board-style<br/>
among the players.                        </div>

                            Cool, Curly.<br><br>I'd be really interested to see how that turned out. My use of the word protagonist was a bit of a red herring though. Hero would have been a better choice, maybe.<br><br>So, I want this thread to do two things, and perhaps I should have stated that clearly to begin with:<br>1.) I want to hear cool ideas for handling non-protagonist and/or non-hero characters.<br>2.) I want to figure out how to handle characters in Boulevard.<br><br>So, yeah. That's where my interests lie in regards to this thread. Andy, Zack and Curly have both been meeting <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> and what they've shared is awesome. Joshua has been hitting on <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> more, and that is also awesome.
<blockquote>If the players are actually playing the Forces, Joe, are there any mechanical limits on what they can do to the characters? That seems, to me, to be the crux of your shit-kicking problem. </blockquote>
So, here's the thing Joshua: Each player takes control of  a single character, and that is THEIR CHARACTER. In the same way that each player has a character in d&amp;d or The Shadow of Yesterday or Don't Rest Your Head (except, there is no GM is Boulevard).<br><br>These characters are not the heroes of the story. The forces that they exist around and within are.<br><br>...Part of what I want to figure out is how those forces get played. Originally, the idea was that characters had Causes, and those Causes gained and lost fuel as time went on. The idea is to gain momentum and fuel those causes, until they blow up.<br><br>And then I got really immersed in school work. And the stuff I was reading about in school (non-representational identity, placelessness as an active force in identity development, rhizomatic identity development) really shaped my thinking about Boulevard. I wanted place, placelessness, and momentum to play a huge role in how the characters were defined.<br><br>And in Boulevard, now, Place and Placelessness and Momentum are all forces that get built up over play. I'm still shaky on details, but an example:<br><br>If the movie Fight Club were a game of Boulevard, the first half of the movie would be like:<br>Place: Tyler Durden, Lou's Tavern.<br>Placelessness: Support Groups, Airplanes, Guns.<br>Momentum: Aggression, Hitting Bottom.<br>Concepts: Hitting Bottom, Modern Masculinty.<br><br>By the time Project Mayhem shows up though, it'd get statted:<br>Place: Paper Street, Fight Club.<br>Placelessness: Project Mayhem, Airplanes.<br>Momentum: Aggression, Hitting Bottom.<br>Concepts: Losing Control, Liberation.<br/><br/>so... those are the forces in play. Place, Placelessness, Momentum, and (for the lack of a better word right now) the Concepts which people base their lives around.<br/><br/>These are group things.<br/>So, there are some players with some characters. Let's say that in the first half of the movie, the characters are Marla and Jack (Tyler Durden is absolutely NOT an eligible character). They all find Tyler Durden to be a place. They find belonging in him. They find the problems they face within him. For Jack, Airplanes are a place he loses himself. You know the "you wake up at O'Hare" montage? That's Placelessness in action. Jack's condo is also a placelessness. <br/><br/>Support Groups could either be a Place or a Placelessness. I'm not sure which they'd be, but for the purpose of this framing, they are somewhere you lose yourself. A place where you don't matter to yourself.<br/><br/>That scene where Tyler Durden spits blood all over Lou? That's the moment that Lou's Tavern stops being a Place. They violate our understanding of belonging. It's now a bar that the owner has been FORCED to give. The social contract of fight club has been violated. Someone pulled a gun. People who were there to fight were vomitting at the sight of this "fight". That's the moment Lou's Tavern stops being a Place.<br/><br/>I'm rambling, hardcore.<br/>Here's my point: Forces are things which have a huge impact on the game. Players collectively control them. They build on them, they make them implode.<br/>...But players have a character, and are expected to immerse themselves in that character.<br/><br/>So, part of it is that, when playing a non-hero, are they REALLY just playing those forces by proxy?<br/><br/>And... I am having trouble articulating hte other part.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

I stuck the notes for my game idea <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://rebel.pbwiki.com" rel="nofollow">here.</a><br/>
(password: honda<br/>
No need to give your email address to see the page.)<br/>
<br/>
I doubt there's anything useful there for you, beyond the concept explained in<br/>
my previous post.  But, well... there it is.  My train of thought, when I had the idea, preserved.<br/>
Don't even feel obliged to look. It will probably just be dissonant with your own train of thought.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As for your last post-- I see where you're going with it, but the nuts and bolts are fuzzy for me.<br/>
<br/>
Here's an example of why.   'Momentum' is a rather abstract category.<br/>
And then 'Hitting Bottom' is also an abstract instance of that category.<br/>
<br/>
So you're pretty far 'out there'-- abstraction upon abstraction.<br/>
<br/>
It helps that Fight Club exists as a reference point, suggesting<br/>
what you're trying to conjure.<br/>
<br/>
But the process is esoteric.    At the very least, I think you'll need<br/>
a really clear explanation of -why- you want players to reverse-engineer<br/>
Fight Club's storytelling structure.   I'm not saying there's isn't a good reason<br/>
to do so.     I'm saying that there are <i>many</i> good reasons to do so-- and<br/>
you expressing your preferred reason, will help players understand<br/>

                            Mike,<br><br>I've seen some game ideas where there is either a GM-controlled our group controlled single protagonist.

I GMed for a d&amp;d group where the Minotaur Prince and the Merciless Bodyguard, both PCs, were protagonists, whereas the other PCs were just supporting cast. The Cleric and the Sorcerer and the Rogue were all along for the ride. The Minotaur and the Bodyguard were the heavy-hitters, and they were the ones with long-standing vendettas towards the big baddies, and they were the faces of the group.<br><br>...That's almost entirely social contract and social dynamics, not intentional game design.<br><br>Those two things are the closest I've seen to what you are describing.

I had not thought of it until you mentioned it, and when you did, I was like "Oh my fucking god, that's totally it."<br><br>But... I haven't played the game long-form, and the session I played was cut short. Tell me: How does the game end? I'm not talking endgame mechanics here, but the story and the tone. Do the characters become heroes? Does The Mistake ultimately become the hero? Are there any heroes?<br><br>...Do you feel characters in Polaris have real agency, over their own lives or their culture's dilemma? If not, why are people drawn to playing them?

Okay, I think I get the question/comment here.<br>It seems like you're saying, "yes, and to what end?"<br>As in, "yes, this is a way of dissecting this kind of story, but what are you trying to take from it?"<br><br>If that isn't what you are trying to say, correct me.<br><br>If it is, then my answer is: Boulevard is about both identity and it is about losing yourself. Defining something as a part of you, and then allowing that thing to consume you. It is about acceleration. Going faster, harder, less perfectly than before. It is about stripping things away, and seeing if "you" even exist underneath. It is about forgetting who the fuck you are.<br/><br/>What I want to take from Fight Club is the overwhelming sense that you cannot control the things you are a part of, as well as the fact that "the things you own, end up owning you".<br/><br/>What I want to take from Requiem for a Dream is the sense that when things SHOULD go right for you, they don't. The American Dream is just a valiant excuse to forget who the fuck you used to be, and deny who the fuck you are.<br/><br/>What I want to take from SLC Punk is that everyone is a poser. The reason you fight is because, well, that's what you do. Seeking to define the things you are a part of is a vain struggle.<br/><br/>What I want to take from Taxi Driver is that heroism is relative. Although I, the designer, am directly telling you, the player, that characters have no agency or victory... the characters themselves don't have to realize that. The ending of the movie feels heroic. It feels like a saviour has emerged from the streets. The man is not a hero, not a saviour, not empowered.<br/><br/>Doom Generation is an exercise in avoiding, and denying, its own premise. The movie's tagline is "A heterosexual movie by Greg Arraki". It's an exercise in not resolving anything. I want to take that away from this movie.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

I don't know that we have a lot, but Ars Magica is a good example of a game that at least recognizes the importance of this structure. While every player is assumed to have a PC magus, the troupe-style play instructions suggest that, for any given 'adventure', only one or two of those (very powerful, very important) mages will be present -- everyone else will be playing supporting characters. I'd go on but I'd rather not derail the thread.                        </div>

                            Oops, I should have been paying attention to this thread earlier! I'm afraid I have to do a little self-promotion, since my thoughts on this have come out in my own work...<br/><br/><br/>Mike, my Trials of the Grail does what you're talking about. One guy is picked to be the Lead Questor while everyone else is explicitly Supporting. The Lead goes through the "hero's journey" while the rest back him up and protect him.<br/><br/>Going back to the main topic...I'm not sure if non-protagonist is quite applicable, depending, but City of Birds has some of the things you've mentioned, Joe. For one thing, I wanted to get away from the PCs being the main drivers of events: rather than setting out to achieve great goals, they mostly react to external forces. (Achieved largely by having players spring conflicts on one another, rather than themselves.)<br/><br/>Also, the most connected, in some ways central character isn't played by anyone, but is an NPC. (And there's no GM controlling him either.) Depending on how you do it, this NPC could really be the proactive one and be yanking the PCs around. I haven't run it this way, but I think it'd be possible to focus so much on the NPC that he would become the lead character. I'll have to try it.                        </div>

                            Me and Segedy are tossing around an idea that seems relevant - a way to model the "Big Man" dynamic seen in Doc Savage or Buckaroo Banzai.  Every player has a character subordinate to the Big Man, and the Big Man is also a fully-fledged communal character, whose "ownership" can be bought with some resource currency.  When you are in charge of the Big Man, your own sidekick sort of fades and you drive the action for a while - until your Big Man mojo fades, and another sidekick takes over.  The Big Man is functionally immortal but his sidekicks are very much not, and his goals should drag them into bad and exciting situations.  So there are layers of competitive mini-game within the social heirarchy, and only the Big Man ever gets any credit for the amazing adventures.                        </div>

Close enough.  I get it now. <br/><br/><br/><br/>I've seen all the inspiration-list movies you cite, except for Invisible Monsters.<br/><br/>FWIW, you might wanna consider these two novels, too:<br/><br/>(This paragraph is from an Amazon.com review)<br/><i>A classic from the moment it first appeared in 1952, Ralph Ellison's 'Invisible Man' chronicles the travels of its narrator, a young, nameless black man, as he moves through the hellish levels of American intolerance and cultural blindness. Searching for a context in which to know himself, he exists in a very peculiar state. "I am an invisible man," he says in his prologue. "When they approach me they see only my surroundings, themselves, or figments of their imagination--indeed, everything and anything except me."</i><br/><br/>and <br/><br/>In One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, the psych ward characters are eclipsed by their respective mental illnesses.  There's a description of shock treatment as a sort of randomizer of personality.  When your personality can't escape a dead end/ the electrodes scramble everything on your 'character sheet' in hopes that a start-from-scratch re-rolling of your 'stats' will be a better configuration... a way to sidestep the dead end.<br/><br/><br/>And lastly... I gotta say... I hate Requiem For A Dream.                        </div>

<blockquote>And lastly... I gotta say... I hate Requiem For A Dream. </blockquote>
Do you hate it because you think that it's poorly done or un-genuine, or do you hate it because it is horrifying and a manifesto of all the things you don't want to believe in? <br/>Because, I definitely hate Requiem for a Dream for what it did to me the first time I watched it. And yet, I am in love with it.<br/><br/>One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is an interesting pick. Hm. I'm probably not going to re-read it, but I am going to ponder it. Thanks.<br/>Invisible Man sounds hella awesome. I'm going to pick it up. Again, thanks.<br/><br/>Invisible Monsters is a book by Chuck Palahniuk. It opens on three primadonnas having a screaming match in a burning building, one holding a shotgun, one wounded, one saying nothing because he face is a scarred lump. We are then told that this will not play out like a book. It'll be like a fashion magazine. Stories will start on one page, and continue on page 87. Everywhere, advertisements will be inserted. You'll get the feeling that, amidst all the page flipping, the substance is missing. Jump to two years ago, when her brother Shane died of AIDS. Jump to a modelling shoot. Jump to...<br/><br/>The book is a bitch because it builds up this impression of How Things Really Are and then jumps back, just to undermine your impressions. It it face-stabby, that way.                        </div>

                            I don't think this is as strange as you might think. I actually believe most players, from time to time, have played a character, either temporarily or permanently,  who wasn't a true protagonist. I've seen it quite a bit. Everyone will be jivin' on one character's story, and the others will be floundering a bit, so the focus of the game kinda shifts to just supporting that strain of the story. I think players are just so ingrained with the idea that PC=protag that they don't realize that they are actually playing a supporting character, not a true protag.<br/><br/>That said, Paul Czege latest project, <i>Acts of Evil</i>, is an attempt to design a game where the PC are all antagonists, and the NPCs emerge as protags. The playtests I've been apart of have seen some decent results, though it's easier said than done.<br/><br/>Ron Edward's <i>Spione</i> is neutral in this regard, PC may or may not emerge as protags. This set up is alot easier than AoE, as you're free to run with whatever direction the fiction seems to be going. In AoE, you're kinda forced to push the fiction in a certain direction.                        </div>

Oh, definitely.  Actually, what's kind of funny is that in the TSOY game I'm currently playing, in a way we're ALL doing this.  We've decided to support an NPC in her bid for ruling over our corner of Maldor.  I think it's created some interesting problems for our GM in some ways, because he wants the PCs to be the instigators of change and the people who drive the plot.  So this NPC has basically ended up being a McGuffin.  Which is fine, except that jeez, if we're all engaging in all this activity to get her on the throne, she's got to have some kind of agency of her own instead of just being a putz. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I also have to admit that I habitually play characters who are in effect "supporting cast members."  Their goals tend to be focused on another person, either another PC or an NPC.  This possibly says something deep and meaningful about my psyche.  Either that or I just always thought Merlin was more interesting than Arthur...<br/><br/>Actually, there's a really cool book by Tamora Pierce called <i>Trickster's Choice</i> that is effectively the same kind of thing.  There's a prophecy, and a kingdom in need of leadership, but the main character of the book is not the person the prophecy is about -- she's in a position of protecting the potential queen long enough for the prophesy to be fulfilled.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Me and Segedy are tossing around an idea that seems relevant - a way to model the "Big Man" dynamic seen in Doc Savage or Buckaroo Banzai.  Every player has a character subordinate to the Big Man, and the Big Man is also a fully-fledged communal character, whose "ownership" can be bought with some resource currency.</blockquote>
This sounds alot like Ron Edward's "Dr. Chaos". He was working on it... I don't know, a year ago? He had a playable draft worked out, but I think it got pushed to the back burner by the Ronnies, <i>It Was a Mutual Decision</i>, and <i>Spione</i>.<br/><br/><i>Dr. Chaos</i> was about a super-villian, Dr. Chaos. Each player could play either a super-hero or a (minor) super-villian. Control of Dr. Chaos was passed along the players according to resources based on the success or failure of the super-heros/villians.                        </div>

                            Hey, Joe --<br/><br/>Uhm, the answer to your question is "I don't know."  It varies from group to group.  According to the rules you can have anything you want, as long as in the end it all comes up nothing.  In practice, sometimes people break the rules, sometimes don't.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben<br/><br/>P.S. I'll note that I don't think that this makes the characters not protagonists.  It just makes them tragic protagonists.  Like the characters in the films mentioned.                        </div>

Yeah, I stopped using the word protagonist, because I finally figured what I wanted to say. It's characters without agency that I'm talking about. So... I kind of shot this thread in the foot by opening it with such a red herring, but whatever. In the process I realized what I meant.

Cool. Thanks, Ben.<br/>I'm going to have to get my group onboard with some long-term Polaris, I think.                        </div>
