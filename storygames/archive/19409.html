That post is below.  But rather than focus on this one particular mapping, I have decided to open up a conversation on ALL sorts of probability maps or stat conversions that can be used to hybridize two game systems.<br/><br/>Are you a mechanics packrat who loves using tables and charts from one system while running another?

This is your AW mod for that roll.<br/>Example: A PC with a %score of 42 would have a +2 mod for that skill/stat in an AW game.<br/><br/><i>To import a 1d100 action resolution roll into an AW game:</i><br/>\xb7 Consult the rows for your AW Stat under the AW10 column (Full Success) and the AW7 column (Partial).  The high-end of the range shown is the number you must roll lower than.<br/>Example: A PC with a +2 needs to roll below 42 for Full Success, and anything from there to 84 is a Partial Success.<br/><br/><i>To import an AW move into a 1d100 game:</i><br/>\xb7 Hitting your %score or lower is a Full Success (10+); hitting within 3 rows down from there is a Partial Success (7-9).<br/>Example: A PC with a %score of 42 needs to roll below 42 (ie hit on their score) for Full Success (10+ result), and anything from there to 84 (3 rows down) is a Partial Success (7-9 result).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
