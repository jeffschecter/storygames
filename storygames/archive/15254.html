I'm willing to wing some things, but not most monsters.</blockquote>\nThere are monsters throughout the Bloodstone Idol section, as part of that adventure. The Red Book is meant to be a starter version of the full game, which is still in development. The name is meant to evoke "Red Box" basic D&amp;D, which also included a module and a few monsters. For more content, you can join the <a href="http://www.dungeon-world.com/index.php/adventurers-guild/" rel="nofollow">Adventurers Guild</a> to get previews of the full game, or you can get the free Hack version, as Chris suggested. <br/><br/>For what it's worth, it's pretty easy to adapt and create monsters once you've run the game and have the hang of how monsters work. The real trick is in matching the numbers of opponents to their levels and that of the PCs- that's an area where the Red Book rules don't give a lot of guidance.\n<blockquote>Are there more classes besides Bard, Cleric, Fighter, Paladin, Ranger, Thief, Wizard?  Maybe someone has posted some somewhere?</blockquote>\nThe Red Book only uses the basics- figher, thief, cleric and wizard, and I'd suggest starting with that until you have a feel for the game. I think other character playbooks are available, but many of them will be designed for the full DW rules.\n<blockquote>I don't own Apocalypse World.  Is it open game content, and you can create your own version a la Dungeon World?</blockquote>\nIt's worth getting AW if you don't have the game (even if you just get the PDF), because it's a good game. You shouldn't need it to play Dungeon World, however.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346592/#Comment_346592" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-21T07:07:46+00:00" title="October 21, 2011  7:07AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 21, 2011 7:10AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are some cool monsters and traps in <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14304" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> - might be inspirational.

I think it's mostly correct though.<br/><br/>-----------<br/><br/>Ozruk the Angry has entered the domain of the Grimtooth Goblins.<br/><br/><b><i>Dwarf Fighter: level 1, d10 damage, 8 HP; str 17, int 8, wis 11, dex 9, con 15, cha 13</i></b><br/><br/><i><b>Goblin warrior: Level 1, 5 HP, 1 Armor, 3 damage (swords, spears)</b> (from "Goblin Advanced Guard" page 91).</i><br/><br/>GM: Ozruk, as you stalk forward toward the gates, you hear a shrill battle cry from behind a barricade ahead and to the right, perhaps 30 feet away. Behind it stand several angry-looking Goblins, hoisting their spears threateningly. <br/><br/>Player: I raise my shield and ring it against the ancient battle-axe of my father, roaring back at them as I move forward.<br/><br/>GM: Okay, you start forward across the narrow stretch of clear stonework between yourself and the barricade at the gate. The floor is littered with the bones and old weapons of previous intruders. What do you do? <i>[Move: Show Signs of Doom]</i><br/><br/>Player: Whatever, I'm killing some Goblins. I charge at them! <br/><br/>GM: All right, that sounds like a Defy Danger move, as the Goblins now launch a rain of spears at you.<br/><br/>Player: Those little weasels! <i>[rolls 2D6, adding nothing for his 9 Dex]</i>. Hmm, I rolled a 7. That's not good.<br/><br/>GM: Right, so you're successful in charging across the killing floor, but as the first volley of spears begin falling around you need to stop and take cover. Do you want to hold here and take advantage of your shield, or charge ahead boldly? <i>[Defy Danger "hard bargain"]</i><br/><br/>Player: Charge ahead! Goblin spears can't stop Ozruk!<br/><br/>GM: Alright, there are four goblins attacking, doing three points each. What's your armor, without your shield?<br/><br/>Player: Ouch! So yeah, my chainmail is 2 armor, so I guess I take 1 point from each attack, for 4 points total. That's half of my hit points! I guess I should have taken cover.<br/><br/>GM: Live and learn, right? At least you are now at the barricade, which you can easily get around. The Goblins turn to meet you, clearly afraid of your ferocity but rushing to meet you anyway <i>[Monster Move: Charge!]</i><br/><br/>Player: They should be afraid. Now that I'm within striking distance, I'm brushing their spears aside and cleaving skulls!<br/><br/>GM: Sounds like Hack and Slash. The Goblins in front are attacking with short swords, while those in back are stabbing with their spears. Make your roll. <br/><br/>Player: <i>[Rolls 2D6, adds 2 for Str]</i> That's a 10! <br/><br/>GM: Good roll. Do you want to expose yourself to attack to do extra damage? <br/><br/>Player: No thanks, I'm already wounded. <i>[rolls 1D10, plus 1 for his signature weapon]</i> They take 7 points. <br/><br/>GM: Okay, the lead goblin takes your hit, your axe slicing through his armor and killing him in one blow <i>[7 - 1 armor vs 5 HP]</i>. His companions attack but you sidestep the blows, and your enemy's falling corpse. What's next?<br/><br/>Player: You said these guys are afraid, right? Can I tell which one them looks like he's in charge?<br/><br/>GM: Try Discern Realities, and see if you can tell in the heat of battle. <br/><br/>Player: <i>[Rolls 2D6, adds 0 for Wis]</i> I rolled an 8, which gets me one question. "Who's really in control here?"<br/><br/>GM: Okay, in the frozen moment after the first Goblin falls, you read their faces- the two in front look a little shocked until the guy in back throws a worried glance at the gate behind them and then yells something. Clearly he's the leader of this band, but the real boss is the big guy inside.<br/><br/>Player: Right. I'm clearing a path to the guy in back then. Hack and Slash? <i>[Rolls 2D6+2]</i> I got an 8, and <i>[rolls 1D10+1]</i> 9 points of damage. <br/><br/>GM: So another one is going to go down, but they're hacking and stabbing at you as well. YOu take three attacks of 3 points of damage. <br/><br/>Player: With my shield and chainmail, I have an armor of 3, so I take nothing. I shake off their attacks laughing!<br/><br/>GM: It's a glorious day for Ozruk! The remaining Goblins begin a fighting retreat to the gates. The one in front leaps on your shield, trying to bring you down.<br/><br/>Player: to hell with that! I'm scraping him off with my axe. Hack and Slash? <i>[Rolls 2d6+2, gets a 5]</i> Crap, total failure!<br/><br/>GM: The Goblin evades your attack, digs his sword into your shield and throws his weight on it, forcing you to let it go before you fall under the blade.<i>[Move: Use up their Resources]</i>The Goblin in charge takes advantage of the moment to drive his spear at you, doing three points, and then backs off. <br/><br/>Player: Argh, without my shield that actually hurts <i>[3 - 2 armor]</i>. I'm down to 3 HP. Still, they're on the run. I'm killing the Goblin standing on my shield and looking for a spear. <i>[Rolls Hack and Slash, gets a 9]</i>. I do <i>[rolls 1d10+1]</i> 10 points of damage. I guess I still take damage right?<br/><br/>GM: Yeah, the Goblin thrusts low with his sword, stabbing you in the leg for 3 points before you sweep his head off his shoulders with your axe. There are spears all around. What do have in mind?<br/><br/>Player: I'm down to 2 hit points. Hmm. As the last Goblin runs for the gate, I'm picking up a spear, ready to throw, and yelling at him to surrender to me or I'll skewer him.<br/><br/>GM: Okay, he's a reasonably intelligent enemy, make a Parley roll.<br/><br/>Player: <i>[Rolls 2D6 + 1 for Cha]</i> I got an 11! Sweet. <br/><br/>GM: He turns, hesitantly, hearing your threats and lowering his spear. "Promise to let me flee this place alive and I will tell you what lies beyond the gates". <br/><br/>---------                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346606/#Comment_346606" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-21T11:07:52+00:00" title="October 21, 2011 11:07AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dang, Steve.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346610/#Comment_346610" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-21T12:16:33+00:00" title="October 21, 2011 12:16PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steve of course nails it!<br/><br/>Thanks for your interest, Chris! DW Basic is the red book, the PDF is the same file as we used for printing the interior of the book so there's no color, since we printed the interior of the book B&amp;W. I can understand the confusion, sorry for that. <br/><br/>The monsters in the Bloodstone Idol should get you started. If you want to move beyond those, here's an easy recipe: take a monster from the Idol, change each stat by +1 or -1, as you feel is appropriate, and give it all new moves. There you go, new monster, easy! I'd lean towards leaving Armor as is most of the time and if you bump up one stat reduce at least one more. Always lean towards paper tigers: an enemy that hits big for a little while is more interesting than one that just won't quit doing 1 point of damage.<br/><br/>As people have mentioned, the Hack version (which is a little out of date, beware) has more monsters and classes.

What about the Wizard who, despite clear and imminent danger from the volley of Orc arrows about to launched, decides to stand in the open and Cast a Spell? No matter how well he rolls, he's probably going to get hurt. <br/><br/>I guess one problem with the "single entity with a damage bonus" approach is that it amounts to one attack at say, 5 points of damage (3 + 2 for gang size) instead of half a dozen hits for 3 points. The first will hurt anybody, while the second can be largely shrugged off by an armored fighter.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike_Olson</cite>GM I can only do so many non-damaging Moves before it starts to feel a little silly.</blockquote> I think the beauty of using DW for dungeon adventures is that encounters (and even straight-up fights) don't have to be all about the back-and-forth hackfest. If you look at the example above, I feel like situational losses (lost footing, poor positioning, hard choices about who or what you have to defend) and material losses (broken weapons and armor, stolen plot macguffins, etc.) are as important as physical damage taking. So I guess I'd argue that there's a lot more room for cinematic failure that isn't reflected in hit points.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346817/#Comment_346817" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-24T13:07:44+00:00" title="October 24, 2011  1:07PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 24, 2011 1:09PM by mease19.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm all for monsters not having levels.

But if the players are about to encounter something that is way out of their league, I would like to know that, and announce Future Doom. <br/><br/>I like the Old School D&amp;D feel where you might fight things way below and way above your level. A level balance system doesn't change that but allows the GM to build expectations and prepare. It's also nice to tie in larger rewards to greater obstacles. If they do push forward and fight something several levels higher than them and survive, I would like any treasure to reflect that. <br/><br/>So to be clear, level balanced system doesn't have to equal balanced encounters. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

Like a goblin by itself, unless it gets into an ambush or other advantageous situation, is never going to take on a well armed human.  Similar to a bunch of nameless mooks or henchmen or whatever, these guys only pose a danger in groups.  So my feeling would be if you hackNSlash some Goblins, you treat a group of them as a single entity with regard to dealing and taking damage and running away.  Not sure how that would transalte directly to DW moves and such, but descriptively, you would describe a character taking on a group by hacking and slashing at multiple foes, shoving one down with a shield, kicking that one in the guts etc... all in one move, and likewise your description of them wrestling a sheild while another stabs in the leg seems very apt.  Damage dealt to a group is sort of to the groups cohesion rather than sepcific wounds to specific individuals.  Once the group gets down to low HP, you can describe individuals dropping, but whilst the group still has high HP collectively, you could describe damage dealt to it as sending a goblin crashing into a wall and another falling to its knees in pain, and then both struggling back up to join the fray soemwhat worse for wear.   But keeping track of individual's HP and damage dealt seems clunky and unneccessary                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346923/#Comment_346923" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-25T17:10:44+00:00" title="October 25, 2011  5:10PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had success in some of my designs using a basic damage level and then a (smaller) modifier for the number of enemies who can engage in a fight.<br/><br/>For instance, let's say your monster does 6 points of damage, +1 per additional.<br/><br/>So, one monster gets you for 6.<br/><br/>But three of the same monster hits you for 8 (6+1+1). <br/><br/>It's relatively simple, and can be calculated quickly, but still keeps it feeling "heroic" without making it a non-issue.<br/><br/>But that's just one way: I'm not 100% sure what would be best for DW.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347002/#Comment_347002" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-26T15:35:21+00:00" title="October 26, 2011  3:35PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, the very early version of groups did pretty much that, but +(monster level) per monster in the group.

When I'm going to quickly throw down a game, I look at the rough party level, then skim through the monster pages in the Adventurer's Guild version looking at monster levels for for ordinary opposition and a couple of higher level for tougher challenges. The level doesn't correspond exactly to Character level, but it doesn't need to. Monster level is just a rough guide for how tough the monster is compared to other monsters; it's a shorthand so I don't have to read full statlines for all monsters when I'm skimming. Removing them would hinder my "prep", in that it might mean that I have to do some rather than just run it as a pick up game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
