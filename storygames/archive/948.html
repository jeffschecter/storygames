                    (crossposted with the Forge because I'm just that enthusiastic about it)<br/>
<br/>
Last night on IRC we had the third session of my new Heroquest game.  Mike Holmes and Joel Shempert were playing, and it rocked.<br/>
<br/>
We were using two house rules:<br/>
<br/>
Goals -- <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=20179" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=20179</a><br/>
Dogs-like Advancement -- <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=19969.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=19969.0</a><br/>
<br/>
In short, character advancement happens directly as a result of getting into diced conflicts, with a bigger advancement for losing the conflict than for winning, and 'goal' traits act as a battery to save up advancements in to buy big traits all at once.<br/>
<br/>
Based on just a single session of play, I have to say that this technique is really rocking.  The players are actively seeking out conflict, drama, and opposition, and gleefully taking it on the chin when they lose.<br/>
<br/>
When Mike posts the logs for the most recent session (3) they'll be appearing here: <a href="http://random.average-bear.com/RegainTheStars/GameLogs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://random.average-bear.com/RegainTheStars/GameLogs</a>  They won't include the OOC channel where conflicts are resolved, but I think you'll be able to see where it all falls out.<br/>
<br/>
On a couple of occasions, I "said yes" rather than "roll dice" and I sensed a small amount of disappointment with that, but at the same time I could usually recover with an alternate conflict that was just as juicy, or moreso.  I think one of the lessons here is that the "roll dice" choice between the two doesn't have to be "roll dice on the player's terms."                </div>

                            The log is saved on my desktop at home - hopefully I'll get it parsed and posted tonight.<br/>
<br/>
I think that your conclusions are correct. That said, I haven't seen Joel play before this game. And for my part, I pretty much seek out trouble for my character, and like to use mechanics in games. What happened in play was just me getting used to doing the recording, and then liking the rewards. That is, you'd see me ask for a contest about something, and then assume that I had done it because I like the rewards. Which I do. But I'd have asked for all of those contests in any case.<br/>
<br/>
Joel, OTOH, may be a better case if he doesn't persue getting into contests as much in other games.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, the development system does seem good for getting players to take on contests. That alone doesn't directly promote drama. But combined with the goal system, I think that together they do get players driving on themes. The only slight concern that I have is one brought up when I proposed a mechanic like the goal one for my PBEM game, which is that players may get "set" in their decided goals, and play only to them. That is, until they reach their goals they may be quite static in their unwavering attempts to get them. Put another way, they may choose a theme, and then play becomes nothing but hammering away at that theme. Instead of allowing them to mutate in play.<br/>
<br/>
What might work is to go with the idea from TSOY, and allow a player to "buy off" a Goal by having the character act in opposition to it. At which point he has to convert it (which is largely what happens in TSOY). That way players can switch goals by dramatically going against their earlier drives.<br/>
<br/>
After you left, Joel and I talked, and he said he was having trouble with some character goals in that some of his personality traits indicated conflicting goals. I said this was not a problem and to just take the conflicting goals. This way, if he accomplishes one, he'll probably have to convert the other goal because it will become unobtainable (likely). But what would be cool, IMO, is to allow the player to drop one of the goals at any point where it makes sense for him to do so. Allowing the critical decision to occur before the goal is achieved, not after.<br/>
<br/>
This matches dramatic sources. Most characters decide on such internal conflicts as part of the climax, and their newfound focus on the chosen remaining single goal makes them capable of winning the chosen goal. In fact, I'm thinking that what you usually do is to convert the conflicting goal into a complimentary one on the spot, and augment with both to achieve the selected one.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure that there are other dramatic conventions that this would support as well.<br/>
<br/>
Mechanically this could be triggered by a contest. That is, one of the selected results could be "Convert a Goal to something else."<br/>

                            Your points are well taken, and it may do well to lay out those options explicitly, but I had always intended for the style of play you describe to be available.                        </div>

                            One thing I'm big on is "mechanical cues." That is, often players have abilities in games that go unused because they're never prompted with the decision to do them - instead they can do them whenever. But since they're not reminded at any time that they have the option, they forget they have it.<br/>
<br/>
I know I do at least.<br/>
<br/>
If you "limit" them to making alterations at certain times as indicated by the mechanics, each time that event occurs, they get reminded that they have the option. Which, I've found, ends up with players using these abilities more than if they were not "limited."<br/>
<br/>
Take the "laurel" idea, for instance. I'd get it, and then forget that I had it for the rest of the session. Which was the biggest reason that it never really got off the ground. Had players been cued at scene end, or contest end or somthing, that might have helped.<br/>

                            That's the great thing about Heroquest.  Since you can keep piling in the augments from all over your character sheet, all the traits get cued.<br/>
<br/>
I see where you're going with this, though... if, for example, failing a contest was explicitly an opportunity to modify a goal, or resolve it as unattainable, and if winning a conflict were explicitly an opportunity to resolve it as fulfilled, then people would take that opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
I'll edit the rule tonight to reflect that.                        </div>
