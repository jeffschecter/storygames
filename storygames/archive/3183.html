The players were on the same page so it went really well. <br/><br/>The concept was, rather than running one game for 4 hours, to try 3 games in that time slot, playing each for 1 to 1 and a half hours, enough to get a feel for them. <br/><br/>I intentially brought games that  A.I owned and had never gotten a chance to play; B. were all indie/small press or semi-experimental; and C. were not what I'd consider the newest or most popular indie games. Of course, one could run a tasting type session with entirely different criteria. I offered up 11 games: Dread, 1984 Prime, Wuthering Heights Roleplay, FVLMINATA, Empire of Satanis, Until We Sink; Knights of the Road, Knights of the Rail; Puppetland, Mazes &amp; Minotaurs, Wyrd is Bond, and Schauermarchen. In retrospect, I think I overdid it; I would probably bring 5-6 games if/when I do this again. I guess I could have just picked 3 games in advance but I liked the idea of giving the players a choice. To cut the prep time, I tried to make sure that most of the games had pre-made characters I could xerox, sample scenarios, and/or or else didn't require traditional preparation. <br/><br/>After I gave a brief summary/pitch of all the games, one of the players  asked me to rate (on a scale of 1-4) how prepared I was to run each one. Then the players each said what their top 3 games were. Since the top 3 vote-getters (1984 prime, until we sink, and wuthering heights) were among the ones I wanted to try the most, I didn't weigh in or veto or tie-break. (I would have thrown puppetland in the top if it had been up to me). It was interesting that at least three of the players said that KORKOR was their 4th choice. <br/><br/>Until we sink\xe2\u20ac\xa6<br/><br/>We started with Until we Sink, which was the only one of the 11 games that I had played before, in a quick session a few days before with my weekly group. That attempt had fell flat. There was some ok banter among characters but the mysteries never gelled and we decided afterwards that some of the cards we picked had been too weak to drive a good story. We probably also approached it too casually for the intended play style. <br/><br/>The gamex session was a lot better. I removed the cards that my regular group had thought were lame from the deck before we started. It helped that we had some strong characters, including Sean Connery (from the celebrity card) and the alcoholic writer for the yin and yang of acerbic, worldweary, boozed-out blowhards; their foils, the apologetic hotel owner and manager, and the suspicious downed pilot- and I got to play as well as a gossipy old Canadian lady. We only reached consensus on 2 of the first 5 or so cards but two of the later cards (the witnessed secret conversation between the manager and pilot) and the note to the manager carved on a tree) inspired theories and arguments that were compelling enough to get buy-in even from the players whose characters were implicated. It turned out that the dead sportsfisher was the manager\xe2\u20ac\u2122s brother; that the manager had in fact been the one killed with the fisherman assuming his duties; and, in a final twist from the manager\xe2\u20ac\u2122s player who admitted his role, that the brother had been exiled from the island and returned to use his people\xe2\u20ac\u2122s ritual powers to sink the island in a final act of revenge. <br/><br/>The game lasted an hour and 2 minutes and gets a thumb up, although since it has minimal system it will probably be hit or miss depending on how much players like free-form speaking in character, whether they are inspired by the card mysteries,  and how they balance implicating other characters and deflecting/accepting allegations about their own character. One other thing- We actually drew the island sinks card right after I shuffled it into the deck but I decided to reshuffle it, which was good because we hadn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t yet introduced the strong ending elements into the game. <br/><br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa6I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll post tomorrow on our 1984 prime and Wuthering heights games                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72569/#Comment_72569" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T22:08:28+00:00" title="May 29, 2007 10:08PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So you took out the underwear card?

It has a strong premise, the families in the setting have distinct and suggestive spheres of innfluence, the book comes with premade characters with rich goals and secrets, and it even has a random scenario generator. We used the generator to get a mission to 'Heal Fortified Bandits.' I interpreted this as the characters being sent to patch up relations with a group of bandits/outsiders who were holed up in a former ski chalet overlooking an important mountain pass. Along the way, their brash military leader tried to collect samples from a swarm of mutated locusts but was forced to flee the ravenous cloud. They were confronted by bandit guards with mishapen potato heads and negotiated with the elders, who agreed to give passage if Haven provided one healthy young man per year to help stabilize the gene pool. The game ended with one character being chosen as the first tribute.<br/><br/>While the premise/setting and resources in the book were inviting and easy to use, the system raised a problem. I had heard from the designer (and from Judson in my regular group, who knows Mischa) that he is working on retooling some of the rules. We used the originally published version .9 rules and recognized an issue with the conflict resolution system early on when I was explaining the rules before play (I hadn't noticed when I was writing a rules summary for a cheat sheet). Static tests work well but there is a seeming glitch in conflicts. Both sides secretly ante some of their chips and then spend the same number each round (unless they pay one chip to change the ante). So the problem seems to be that if you really want to win a conflict, you'll try to spend chips as slowly as possible and always ante one, which leads to too many ties and to overlong conflicts with little tension). Amittedly, our two conflicts in the game, the locusts and negotiating with the bandit elders, didn't devolve into such low ante slogfests but that was partly because neither challenge pressed the characters too hard.<br/><br/>After the game, a couple of players mentioned that they thought that dogs in the vineyard system would work well with the 1984 prime situation since this game involved young people from a distinctive community going out into the world. But I liked the idea of Prime's resource/chip based system and would enjoy a diceless post apocalyptic game if the conflict rules are modified. I'm looking forward to see future manifestations of this game.<br/><br/><br/>When we talked about <b>Wuthering Heights roleplay</b>, some of the players had heard of it but thought that it was more of a parody or joke game than one meant to be played. They were glad to hear that it was legit and we had fun with it. I had enjoyed making pregen characters for this game. Characters are a collection of problems so we had republican, addict poet/printer's apprentice; a sick, occultist gypsy; a naive lesbian dance hall singer; an ugly, deaf, pianist and methodist rector; and a puny, alchoholic, badly dressed waiter with improper longings for his sister the singer. I kicked things off with a funeral (an idea lifted directly from an old actual play post by devp) and the game quickly focused on two conflicts: the rector wanting to drive the gypsy out of town and a love quadrangle with the poet and singer competing for the affection of the a french artist's model and the waiter pining over singer/sister. The game ended with a pair of murders commmitted with a fork and a piano. <br/><br/>I felt like the system was a little overcomplicated or at least densely presented for what it was trying to accomplish (which is to seesaw the character emotionally and have each setback give rise to new problems, sort of a version of cocteau's infernal machine with outrageous romantic color.) I could have used a flowchart to keep track of the variations of rolling under/over rage, despair, oldness and the fallout from those shifting values. I did like how art and seduction and murder had their own two-step systems, and we lumped preaching and telling fortunes under the art/seduction subsystem, which worked well. <br/><br/>I probably should have spaced the scenes out further in time so there would be more of a novelistic feel of strangers arriving in town and notorious rumors arrising etc- but I guess with out hour long session it was fine to lump the action into a few climactic and emotionally chaotic scenes. <br/><br/>After running this just once, however, I'm convinced it's a classic game in all senses and probably more influencial than I suspect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
