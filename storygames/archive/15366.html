It seems very well suited to long term play, as the building up of a detailed magical "system" really only can occur over many sessions.  Does this create a viable "setting bible" for magic or do people tend to forget about earlier facts when they're not right in their faces?<br/><br/>2 - Shifting characters. I like the character statements that are the building blocks of the character and play.  How did your characters change over time, can you give some specific examples?<br/><br/>3 - Player screens.  Craziness, you all reveal at once?! Did you use player screens or just your hands or just trusted each other not to look?<br/><br/>And tell me all about how great your Mortal Coil games have been, with special attention to games that went 30 sessions or more.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348943/#Comment_348943" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-15T09:56:05+00:00" title="November 15, 2011  9:56AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 15, 2011 9:57AM by GB_Steve.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1.

The major change in players is the change of passions. For example in Flaming Taft (Flaming TAFT!), my character had an altercation with his father.

And I loved the collaborative world-creation session we had before starting play -- we created a "Twin Peaks"-like setting, bored psychic teenagers in an isolated town in Maine where Something Bad is happening in the woods.<br/><br/>What I found in play, though, is that the diceless token bidding was complex enough to derail the sense of immersion in the game. I expect any kind of combat/conflict system to shift my mindset from narrative to game; but usually it's a matter of making a quick decision about what skills/aspects to use, working out a target number, and rolling dice. In MC I ran into analysis-paralysis trying to compute how many tokens my opponents were likely to bid, what kind of margin I needed to succeed, and how many I could afford to sacrifice. It was quite difficult and became not-fun \u2014 kind of like splitting the bill at a sushi bar when everyone's ordered different items.<br/><br/>I think part of this is purely psychological \u2014 when I know that the outcome is ultimately in the hands of a randomly-rolling bit of plastic, it excuses me from trying to work out the perfect choice of action. But when it's just me against the GM, even though I can't predict his actions much better than I can a die, it feels less random and more like pure strategy; Go instead of craps, say. And I like Go, but it's totally the opposite of a roleplaying game for me, and the two didn't mix. Of course, that might just be me. Other people demonstrably like the game a lot.<br/><br/>(The same criticism might apply to other diceless systems like Amber; but I haven't tried any of those.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349001/#Comment_349001" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-15T19:57:27+00:00" title="November 15, 2011  7:57PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yah, I've had a great time with resource-allocation RPGs like Marvel Universe before, so I won't have that issue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349012/#Comment_349012" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-15T22:49:05+00:00" title="November 15, 2011 10:49PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey snej: I haven't played Mortal Coil enough to know if this will be a thing for me, but I definitely - DEFINITELY - understand where you're coming from 100%, I have the same thing.<br/><br/>I don't think the criticism with Amber will apply: The system is so simple, so transparent ("high number wins! unless you spend enough time doing plots-within-plots for why they wouldn't!") that it can't break immersion.<br/><br/>However, games with let's call it "a high degree of handling", especially in conflicts that require lots of "hooyas/pieces/bits" to be on the table and shuffled around and can take a while to resolve. FATE is aaaaaaaalllllmost on the edge of that blade for me. While I like Nine Worlds on paper, for example, all the card handling really stabs roleplaying in the face as we narrow our eyes and play The Card Game Inside of Nine Worlds. Whereas Dust Devils, which also uses cards, has a much, much faster resolution (one draw) and thus immersion is preserved since it doesn't jump off into fiddly bit land.<br/><br/>Not sure a longer campaign of MC would do that for me (everyone's threshold is different), but I totally get where you're coming from.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349017/#Comment_349017" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-16T02:04:05+00:00" title="November 16, 2011  2:04AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            MC certainly does have an intense resolution system and although this means something of a break in play to resolve things, I've not had any problem with immersion (qv the various APs). I've got a German friend who just rolls dice for the resolution in MC. The thing I do like is that we keep on playing our characters during the resolution with reveals and extra spends being described in game. The MC system has the nice capability of handling multiple stakes, some opposed, some orthogonal, as well as side bets and I think that's why we've kept using it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349019/#Comment_349019" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-16T02:25:23+00:00" title="November 16, 2011  2:25AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 16, 2011 2:26AM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Every time I think about playing it (which I do occasionally, though probably not as often as Mssr. Corley) I pretty quickly come to the conclusion that I would have to scrap the resolution system entirely. I just don't see any payoff to the complexity/handling time, and to be honest there are parts of the system that I either can't wrap my head around OR are just basically not-good. It feels like a re-skinned WoD skill resolution system with a whole bunch of clutter laid on top. I think the last time I thought about it I was working on a TSoY hack, which is funny since I don't really like TSoY's actual dice very much at all -- but compared to MC's system almost anything else feels crystal clear.<br/><br/>Magic facts and passions are really the good stuff in the game, to me, and also have the advantage of being five times more elegant and ultra-portable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349022/#Comment_349022" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-16T03:50:31+00:00" title="November 16, 2011  3:50AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree that the resolution can be seen as a barrier to play.

The mechanics were great for 1v1, but the narration never seemed to go that way in any game we played.

It looks to me like the bidding system for setting prices/facts allows a player to override group consensus from within the rules framework.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: thadrine</cite>There are no rules for resolving a task that is not opposed.</blockquote>\nI donno that this one is that important. If you are trying to leap across a gap, I just keep asking "Why?" until you either run into opposition ( "Because I want to catch the bad guy!") or until I determine you're doing it more to explore or express something internal and say, "Okay, you leap across the gap."

I'm just curious, because I did add in some rules for conflicts not against a person in there. Also, I have been able to run multiple-person conflicts using the system, but they do get complicated as you say. You need to stay really clear on what each person's overall goal is, and what the goal is for each individual action during the conflict. I've done conflicts with up to six different characters all trying to get different things, but that required a lot of concentration from me as a GM and took a bit of time to work through.<br/><br/>That said, these are all legit criticisms of the system and some problems I've run into myself in the past. I don't think the rules are great for every group. I've got a lot of system familiarity, which helps when I'm running it, and some groups seem to have no problems. One thing that I think can throw groups for a loop is the fact that the game requires a strong GM hand, which combined with the high degree of player input can be confusing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349212/#Comment_349212" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-19T07:36:43+00:00" title="November 19, 2011  7:36AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought I did have Revised, but on investigation it looks like not.

I expect any kind of combat/conflict system to shift my mindset from narrative to game; but usually it's a matter of making a quick decision about what skills/aspects to use, working out a target number, and rolling dice. In MC I ran into analysis-paralysis trying to compute how many tokens my opponents were likely to bid, what kind of margin I needed to succeed, and how many I could afford to sacrifice. It was quite difficult and became not-fun \u2014 kind of like splitting the bill at a sushi bar when everyone's ordered different items.</blockquote>\nSo, I've never read or played Mortal Coil (though have heard a fair bit about it), so I may be talking nonsense, but: could you get around this with a rule that whoever wins only actually pays one more token than the runner up? That way you only need to compute how badly you want X to happen rather than worrying overly about how much other people might bid.

It's good natured roughhousing.<br/><br/>Everyone secretly allocates:<br/><br/>Theseus has 2 in Force, he allocates 3 tokens and chooses to battle Sierra with <br/>Harold has 3 in Force, he allocates 2 tokens and chooses to help Theseus battle Sierra<br/>Sierra has 2 in Grace,  and chooses to defend herself with 5 tokens.<br/><br/>(Let's pretend nobody has applicable aptitudes and any other actions are resolves separately)<br/><br/>Harold is helping, so we resolve his attempt to  help first. 3+2 = 5 &lt; 2+5 = 7, he fails to help.<br/><br/>Let's say the same situation happens and Harold allocates 5 tokens. 3+5 = 8 &gt; 2+5 = 7, he helps. Theseus gets a +2, taking him from a clear failure (-2) to a near success (0).<br/><br/>But if Harold had just targeted Sierra directly, he would have gotten a +1, a success.<br/><br/>Sierra is better off because Harold decided to help his friend.<br/><br/>It seems like helping only actually helps if both the helper and the helped are both going to beat the target (this increases the margin of victory by 2 and pushes the degree of Harm (for example) into a new category.)<br/><br/>If a helper couldn't overcome the target on their own, they are better off either switching to a different realm of conflict (intimidation, magic) for their own action.  Or, now that I think of it, to help in a different way than direct assistance.<br/><br/>Is that right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
