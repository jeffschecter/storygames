On Saturday night, we returned to the hotel after dinner and we were trying to decide what to do while we drank wine. My co-vacationers were not storygamers at all (and they generally poke fun at my "geeky" hobbies). But, they enjoy games like Cards Against Humanity and Apples to Apples. I had recently purchased Microscope, and I had it in my bag, so I suggested we play it. I figured that the size of the rulebook is not that intimidating, and it involves cards (so it KIND OF seems like games they were used to). I didn't tell them it was a "roleplaying game." I just explained the steps in order and we played. <br/><br/>It was really fun. Some of my expectations were busted, and I made some observations:<br/><br/>-- I expected that non-gamers would be most intimidated by playing "scenes" and the roleplaying part -- I was completely wrong. Scenes were the part of the game everyone was the MOST comfortable with. In general, when given the chance, almost everyone opted to make a scene rather than a Period or an Event. <br/><br/>-- The part that required the most explanation (far and away) was the terminology. I had to explain the distinction between Periods and Events several times throughout the game. Concepts like "focus," "legacy," and "tone" did not really stick at all, so I gave up explaining them after a while -- though I did continue to tell the player to the right of the focus to perform the legacy task, so legacy continued to do its work. <br/><br/>-- The game trended toward the funny, the absurd, and the obscene (rendering the concept of "tone" sort of moot). In part I'm sure this was the case because I pitched it as a "party game" they might like since they like Cards Against Humanity. But, I still doubt that they would have been down for creating a new version of the Silmarillion or Dune. That said, there was no shortage of creativity, and we had some awesome scenes. (There was a great one where a tapeworm, a botfly, and a urethra fish who were living in the intestines of a T-Rex during the Jurrasic Period were arguing over who should get the most digestive tract real estate. The T-Rex was also a character and every time it would do something strenuous, the parasites would have to cope with a bowel quake). <br/><br/>-- Even though it is a GMless game, I did a little "GMing" in the first few scenes to get the ball rolling -- I didn't describe any fiction when it wasn't my scene, but I would ask some provacative questions. (I think that might be technically against the rules, but it helped early on when people weren't sure what to say). By the end of the game though, my training wheels weren't needed. <br/><br/>-- The group was not concerned with continuity at all, but the microscope system takes care of that automatically, and when we were done, it was fun to read the history of the world we had created. And, everyone liked recalling funny/memorable moments. <br/><br/>Anyway, considering it was the other players' first story game EVER and my first try with Microscope, I thought it was a great success. I'll be trying it out in my regular Tuesday gaming group in order to build a world for an upcoming Burning Wheel game -- I think the history my gaming group makes will be more detailed and serious. But, in addition to epic histories and dramatic world building, Microscope appears to be a perfectly good silly vacation party game for people who are not inclined to identify as gamers at all.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411605/#Comment_411605" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-08T16:53:06+00:00" title="April  8, 2013  4:53PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great data points! (Anecdotally speaking of course. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Thanks for sharing it. Did the players express interest in role playing more after playing? And you said they felt most comfortable with the scenes, was it that they "got" playing a character more than adding to a timeline better? Or because they just enjoyed that more? Or something else?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411658/#Comment_411658" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-09T08:32:35+00:00" title="April  9, 2013  8:32AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good questions. I actually don't think the players are any more interested in roleplaying than they were before they played. (Unfortunately.) I could be wrong, but even though I think they very much enjoyed Microscope, and would play it again, I don't think Microscope will be a gateway to other games. <br/><br/>I think the primary motivation of the players was to laugh and to make other people laugh. I think that one reason the scenes were popular was because scenes were the best vehicle to that end -- and probably not because anyone cared about playing a character. Nobody really seemed to identify with any characters or think much about what happened to them in the story. And, nobody would have been tracking how one event led to another if I hadn't be reminding them to place cards in the chronology. I suspect they didn't hold on to the timeline aspect of the game well because they just didn't care about it. It's neat that the game ends up creating a timeline so that at the end everyone can recall what happened. But, the fun for the "non-gamers" was not really in the longterm big picture, it was in the gags.<br/><br/>I don't think the idea of caring about/rooting for a character is as intuitive as many regular story gamers might think. I've noticed a very arm's length approach by first-time-players before. I once ran a Lady Blackbird game for some friends who had never played, and I had a scene where an NPC little girl witnessed a PC's (trivial) crime. I was trying to set up a scene where the PC had to figure out how to deal with this little girl . . . the PC's solution: throw the little girl out the window. To my surprise, nobody at the table even blinked. They just laughed. They didn't consider that the action now meant that the character was a sociopathic nutcase who would rather murder a child than get embarrassed. It was just that, to them, the characters in the story weren't REALLY characters. It wasn't REALLY a story. It was all just a chance for the PLAYERS to say outlandish things and be silly. Remembering what happened from scene to scene in the fiction (which most gamers do without even thinking about it) seemed like a chore -- let alone memorizing rules. <br/><br/>I think that for a lot of people the idea of making a character and coming up with a complex story seems more like work than fun. Microscope worked well though because it doesn't require computation or memorization and the rules help keep the story in context without too much concentration.                           </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411742/#Comment_411742" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-10T06:45:56+00:00" title="April 10, 2013  6:45AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, that post deserves an entire thread of discussion all on its own, AMBayard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411749/#Comment_411749" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-10T07:38:14+00:00" title="April 10, 2013  7:38AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So you wish it -- so it shall be!                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411761/#Comment_411761" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-10T10:14:38+00:00" title="April 10, 2013 10:14AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First of all: wow.
