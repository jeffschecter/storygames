Currently I am working on a project, that I hope one day might become its own game, called Wuxia Space Opera. As the name suggests this is an SF setting, not hard scifi, based on Wuxia and some elements of Chinese Folklore (in the way something like Zu Warriors or Chinest Ghost Story or Hero is - as opposed to straight up Bruce Lee kungfu). It is important to notw a few things: firstly I don't intend to discuss everything I have all at once, which might be counter productive in places. Secondly, this isn't meant to be like Hellas (or similar projects); it isn't straight up chinese culture/folklore in space. It is a synergy of these things often using anglicised terminology (which has its own flavour as a result) rather than naming everything after the chinese words (i do not speak chinese in any form, nor do I claim any cultural expertise, nor am I even chinese in any way shape or form). Thirdly the science is light. Science and tech are important to the setting, obviously, but I am not a scientist nor a reader of hard SF. This is not Eclipse Phase (not that there is anything wrong with EP either, but it is intense).<br/><br/>With that in mind, I'm posting specifically to discuss how to create the River. This is the galactic internet of the setting. It is important to have this because this is the analog for Taoism/Heaven in the setting (ancient AI instead of the Jade Emperor) - and because there needs to be something like a mass comms/info system in the setting really. But what should this be? There are a few problems already: mainly that, in rpg terms, cyberspace is often problematic. It's just something that doesn't really work in the narrative space roleplaying occupies (I'm thinking in terms of netrunning/jacking into systems/hacking). Also I don't want the whole concept to get bogged down in huge levels of describing computer systems and operations. This isn't specifically a cyberpunk setting. So:<br/><br/><i>The Xia Empire created the River as it exists today; the galactic information and communication network. It was made in the shadow of the Supreme Ultimate System, the network built by the Tien and administered by their singular Ancestral Intellects: sentient programs built to control the system.<br/>The River has survived the demise of the Xia Empire and the fragmentation of the 10,000 stars, including the rise of the Iron Emperor. It still exists across the galaxy, but each state and organisation has its own territory within. Imperial Iron Qin, for example, has the Great Firewall, which is actively protected by deadly software, to keep out intruders, and the Bureau will pursue hackers across the galaxy if need be.<br/>During the time of the Xia the River was more easily accessible and its own system intelligences, known as Shen, were abundant. Most every cyber interest, such as merchant organisations or noble houses, had Shen representing them in infospace.<br/>In the modern age access to the River is guarded; knowledge about its systems and operations has become the purview of Data Shamans. In more civilised/populated areas entry level system access is easy enough, but elsewhere and for more complex interactions such individuals are needed.</i><br/><br/>Background:<br/>The Xia Empire - the great cultural pinnacle of galactic civilisation that serves as a cultural and ethical ideal for the heroes of the troubled present.<br/>The Tien - the most advanced culture to ever exist; nonhuman they ruled the galaxy - the 10,000 stars, in ancient times as a precursor race. Note that humans in this setting, like Star Wars, do not come from earth. Earth/Terra is not a part of this galaxy.<br/>Iron Qin - the default bad guys of the present; led by the all powerful Iron Emperor (he knows all the best kungfu/power) they are an oppressive regime that has risen in the wake of the Xia Empire and is the most powerful of the current states.<br/>The Bureau - we might think of Iron Qin as similar to communist China; the Bureau of Doctrine is a pwoerful agency that deals with threats to the cultural stability imposed by Iron Emperor. It deals, for instance, with dissidents and produces propaganda. An all encompassing shadowy tyrannical agency.<br/><br/>HTH.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402792/#Comment_402792" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-06T08:39:27+00:00" title="January  6, 2013  8:39AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can you describe what you want the River to actually do?<br/><br/>Like, is this like a super-Google that contains all known information?<br/><br/>Or is it more like the action-oriented cyberspace of Shadowrun/CP2020 where automated drones and security systems are so ubiquitous that entering it is like going to a gun show?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402793/#Comment_402793" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-06T08:57:47+00:00" title="January  6, 2013  8:57AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            well, it's an SF setting so there needs to be some kind of 'internets' I think. However I don't want it to be fetishised like cyberpunk with lists of processes and tech. This is a larger setting, where cyberpunk focuses on the net much more exclusively.<br/>How it would play out I don't know. I intend one character type to be an AI. This was inspired by the infomorphs in Eclipse Phase which resolved for me how to do a taoist wizard type: a hacker meets sorcerer type in an interesting way.<br/>So essentially the River isn't an ubiquitous AR type scenario, overlaying onto everyday life. At least not for the moment: it's a separate and mysterious realm, like any magical space and that is more or less what it's purpose is. I want to create a synergy of tech and mysticism; not scifi and magic, or just scifi.

You might think Heaven would work, but it's too charged.<br/>Essentially FTL is done through a network of gates (ie Tao - the way), similar to B5 or perhaps Fading Suns. These are Dragon Gates and they are each surrounded by a station with its own port culture. I thought that would be evocative. However it is important that FTL travel doesn't become something that bogs the game down. This is not a hard science setting (though it isn't complete nonsense either) and so travellers - ie the PC's - need to get to where they are going reasonably quickly and reaosnably autonomously. Otherwise it's not really space opera. The River doesn't need to work in terms of hard science.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402811/#Comment_402811" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-06T11:31:06+00:00" title="January  6, 2013 11:31AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, so we have wuxia and we want the Internet to be a mysterious otherworld accessed by those in the know. How about this: in the far distant past the River was created as a self-maintaining network of nanoreplicating relay stations. It was originally intended for [insert some sane reason, or perhaps insane reason], but it's basically become ubiquitous in the human sphere, as it spreads germ-like in people's clothes and machines, pollinating new star systems as they are being colonized. All humans have the River within them from the time they were born. The most basic maintenance replicator units are literally nano-scale and invisible to the naked eye, but the River has inherent tendency to build various sizes of microprocessors, relay antennas, cameras, storage devices and other such tech paraphilia wherever you don't dust too often. The houses of taoist technomages often sport strange Riverbot structures on and in their walls. Some AI are rumored to live <i>in</i> the River instead of just accessing it from their human-built mainframes.<br/><br/>The thick network of low-power relays enables network connectivity anywhere and everywhere, regardless of security precautions. EMP pulses cause disturbances in the Force - the River, that is - but due to massive redundancy it's virtually impossible to cut the River out of anywhere except the most carefully prepared clinical spaces. Reprogramming the River nanobots, or introducing your own strain (assuming the technology still exists and somebody wants to risk a grey goo event) is possible, but in practice the dominant strain will always be the one that has the evolutionary advantages over long term; nobody quite understands why the local dominant strain seems to almost always accept low-level networking protocols by electromagnetic waves. Some taoist technomages claim that the reason is selection pressure caused by local taoist temples: they feed extra energy and resources to carefully sieved Riverbot pollen, ensuring that human-friendly strains retain long-term dominance regardless of momentary movements in the ecology.<br/><br/>Almost anybody can use the River for everyday connectivity purposes with suitable computer paraphelia. The taoist mages who understand difficult concepts like natural selection and Riverbot psychology can do feats like using the River without machinery and hacking random machines through the River, regardless of whether they're supposed to be accessible on the software or hardware level to outside entry. They can also use e.g. Riverbot microcameras to divine sights of distant places, insofar as they can make sense of the chaotic skein of phenomena that the nanobot swarm experiences. The phenomenon is not entirely understood by science at this point, possibly due to mutations in the Riverbot strains that develop on various worlds.<br/><br/>The most important limitation that the River has is that it's localized and cannot break the lightspeed barrier. In fact, sometimes it can hardly break the sound barrier due to the way the relay network transmits information. The speed of pure River (relying only on the smallest of nanobot relays without macrosize structures) is about as fast as a bird can fly, but the Riverbots can take over or build stronger relay stations that can actually transmit signal in electromagnetic form over longer distances, which basically gets you ordinary radio signal speed - the speed of light, that is. Even that practically limits the River to a single planet at a time, as communication lag makes most types of Internet use infeasible over longer distances. Just moving River pores between star systems through the Dragon Gates does not transmit information per se, as individual Riverbots are too small to actually contain data; data only exists in the living network, and in storage machines that humans use. All this means that while information is locally ubiquitous, it is entirely possible to keep individual star systems in information quarantine by preventing the use of Dragon Gates.<br/><br/>The second-most important limitation is that the River cannot handle high-energy technology. The network consists of the tiniest machines, they burn out like flies in a candle flame if you try to make them e.g. direct lightning bolts at your enemies. The River is harshly limited in its ability to act upon the material world, and while taoist mages have been known to e.g. levitate semi-spontaneously with Riverbot aid, the local Riverbot ecology takes a long time to recover afterwards.

Of course we can pick any arbitrary combination of activities and color to define our future Internet ("The Internet of the future involves raising cattle"), but to make it compelling and sensible for the audience we need to have structural, thematic principles. One such could be "this magic is supposedly technological, so which scifi buzzwords justify the fantasy?" Another one is "this is wuxia in space, so the Internet will work exactly like the Taoist religion worked in medieval China, except this time the magic is real".<br/><br/>I mean, it's cool if you're not one bit interested in the technobabble of how your Internet works, but if this is the case, then what is it that you're lacking, exactly? Why is it not enough to just say that these people in this setting don't have an Internet in a modern sense, but they do have a Spirit World, which was presumably created technologically in the distant past, but we don't know how, and for current purposes it works exactly like an animist religion like Taoism says it would. Then for practical purposes you can just say that the River enables taoist experts to pray to the spirits to access information, do divination and in general be wise men. Procedurally this can work exactly like magic would in any fantasy game, no need for cyberspace shenanigans or anything.

What do you mean by Taoist magic? If this wasn't a science-fiction game, what would Taoist magic be, what would it entail, and how would it relate to what the characters actually <i>do</i> in the setting? Once you have answers to that, maybe you can figure out how this relates to technology and the still-far-too-vaguely-defined "secrets, lore, knowledge."<br/><br/>Or, alternately, approach it from a purely mechanical perspective. You want this to "work in the same narrative space roleplaying occupies": what does that mean in your game? And what are the rules already asking players to do, and how/why should doing things with the River be different from that? When a player decides that they want something from the River, how much actual real-life time do you want to spend resolving that, and what are the other players doing when it's happening? How much emphasis/attention should interacting with the River get during a game session?<br/><br/>I'm not sure anyone here can give you a decent suggestion without knowing more about what you actually want to do. It'd help everyone (probably even you) if you could nail down what it is you actually want out of putting the River in your game, and what you don't want out of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402892/#Comment_402892" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-07T05:49:11+00:00" title="January  7, 2013  5:49AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What do I want from it?<br/><br/>Well, cyberspace is a big part of SF, this isn SF (in part, probably closer to something like science fantasy, like Star Wars) completely, so the answer is: what can this SF concept do? How can it be used? Digital space is a reasonable analog for the traditional Taoist celestial bureacracy.<br/><br/>That said, I don't want the game to revolve around the River in the way that something like Shadowrun revolves around hacking/the Matrix.

And that tells us basically nothing about the Holonet; it is in the background, but its explicit existence doesn't really matter to the storytelling. The point I'm aiming at here is: don't include the River just because you think it is somehow "supposed to be there." The design philosophy around here, at least, generally accepts that--in roleplaying games as in high literature--the extraneous and vestigial interferes with the vision and execution of a game. We're unlikely to give you the sort of advice that you're looking for unless you can tell us more about what you want out of the River.<br/><br/>JD and Eero have both offered interesting solutions which would add further dimensions to the sorts of stories you could tell with your game. If you're not interested in adding the sorts of stories enabled by this technology, then (to reiterate what Eero said) it might be better to just hand-wave the whole thing and move on. Or if you are interested in enabling some types of stories which are River-focused (but which are not hacking focused, as you've made clear, and which are not like JD's personal vault style of knowledge or Eero's techno-Force idea), then you'll need to be clear (mostly to yourself, but also to us) about what sorts of stories you <i>do</i> want the River to enable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402915/#Comment_402915" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-07T11:22:52+00:00" title="January  7, 2013 11:22AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's possible that the concept of story is not the most useful design tool for GW's game plan. Regardless, being purposeful is a good idea: if the notion of Internet doesn't really entice in the greater context of the game, it would be quite OK to just say that this setting doesn't have it. If we can accept positively fantastic concepts ("This setting has faster than light travel!") as audience, surely we can accept the negatively fantastic ("These people don't have an Internet!") as well.<br/><br/>Thinking in strictly utilitarian terms, then: what would a D&amp;D party of haphazard hoboes do with the local Internet-equivalent, the River? How would they go about it in practice? In concrete terms: what manner of power and opportunity might the Internet offer, and with what kind of systemic procedure?<br/><br/>GW mentioned the celestial bureaucracy. How about if the River is layered into opaque levels of access on the basis of your network load? Everybody gets to transmit e.g. text in the system, but only those who have higher levels of access privileges can work with sound and video and cloud computing and maintenance access to networked computers and so on and so forth. Of particular importance is the fact that a moderately high level of access enables you to transmit information at near instantaneous faster than light speed even across different star systems; the technological specifics of how the River accomplishes this are not known.<br/><br/>The flavourful bit here is that the River is autonomous: it's not the local political elite that decides who has access, but rather it's the River itself; it's not quite clear whether it's some big AI on top, or if it's just an automatic heuristic. What is known is that net-oriented people of all worlds have the chance to take examinations (the topics are Chinese classics and computer maintenance) conducted by the River itself, and gain higher levels of use privilege. This privilege also comes with responsibility: high-level users are obliged by the network (it sends you eletronic spirits with messages from the Celestial Emperor) to maintain River technology by setting up and fixing relay stations, running server farms and so on. High-level celestial bureaucrats can wield power by using their access to benefit people willing to pay for it. Usually people committed to achieving the highest levels in the celestial bureaucracy believe in some spiritual precepts ranging from personal immortality ("I will be uploaded if I serve the River long enough!") to dangerous fanaticism ("Of course I will kill and maim others if the River says so - for the Emperor!") to harmony-oriented spiritualism ("As the River flows, so does the sand in the hourglasses of our lives...").<br/><br/>It is also easy to assume that there are some sort of "dark taoists" out there who leech resources from the River without working for privilege level within the system.<br/><br/>For gaming purposes all this means that a given character's focus on the River may be expressed in terms of privilege level. You can just make a long list of all the various things that "an Internet" might enable, and then divide them into a number of levels. Individual characters can then get an access level in character creation or work for it in play. And when the players want to do something with the Internet, you don't need to make a big production of it like in Cyberpunk 2020; you can just check the privilege level of the character, and if he's allowed by the River to peek into a rival's email, then that's what goes. Maybe add some skills related to tech maintenance (for worship purposes) and hacking (for actually using your privileges effectively) if you want to.<br/><br/>Note that this kind of no-drama approach would work best if the Internet generally won't allow you to godmode your way through the game; I understand that this is cool with you if you're just adding the Internet in there for the setting color. It would be pretty nasty if a game just had this thing called "privilege level", and having it enabled you to fuck other characters up in important ways without going through complex systemic prosesses.
