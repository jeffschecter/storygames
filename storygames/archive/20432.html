I was up till 3 am), and have been pondering the best way to get the new system across, given that folks probably don\u2019t want to have to wade through pages and pages of text, and last night it suddenly came to me: simply write out a precis of the game, including a basic intro to the proposed new system, basic structure, materials needed and a list of other sections of the book. Looks quite good, even if I say so myself, and now I'm thinking this would be a pretty good way to introduce any new game. If a lot of game designers already do that then so much the better. Anyway, have a squizz and see what you think. I\u2019m getting very close now to moving into new accommodation, so I should be able to start online playtesting of this and other games very soon. The cover is the same as before, I'm including it here for those folks that haven't seen it yet. <br/><br/><a href="http://tinyurl.com/qfnqhfc" rel="nofollow">Cover</a><br/><a href="http://tinyurl.com/pqcr64l" rel="nofollow">New system</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449389/#Comment_449389" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-10T19:49:04+00:00" title="November 10, 2015  7:49PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since you bring up Drama System: Why not convert it completely to a DramaSystem playbook/hack? <br/>Hillfolk has a lot of settings, yet really use more nice playbooks in <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B8rCma1jEmU9dVBDU0I0bHhTMWs" rel="nofollow">this style (Hillfolk one-shots)</a>.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449395/#Comment_449395" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-10T22:21:58+00:00" title="November 10, 2015 10:21PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The presentation is fantastic (I wish more games had such a precis), and the back cover blurbs really catch my attention.

Not saying there\u2019s anything wrong with that \u2013 there are some great AW and other hacks out there \u2013 it\u2019s just not my cup of tea. To be fair, the way I\u2019m suggesting using the tokens isn\u2019t exactly the way DramaSystem uses them, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s a bit similar and I thought it would be a helpful hook for people if they\u2019ve played games with tokens used in that sort of way. Secondly, I\u2019m not very keen on character sheets with lots of boxes and tables and so on, preferring them (especially in story games) to be as simple as possible. Also, <i>Great Minds</i> is generally intended to be a light-hearted story game (although it\u2019s certainly possible to run an emotionally intense session \u2013 as I mention in the foreword to the new draft, there are several potentially combustible issues, such as Women\u2019s suffrage and emancipation and the rise of Fascism and Communism etc.), so I\u2019m not sure that DramaSystem would be a good fit. However, when it\u2019s published, if folks want to write hacks of it for other systems I\u2019d be totally fine with that.     \n<blockquote>The presentation is fantastic (I wish more games had such a precis), and the back cover blurbs really catch my attention. Nice!</blockquote>\nThanks! It\u2019s a way of solving a specific problem (that of folks not wanting to wade through pages of text to grasp the nub of the game) that seems to have become a thing in itself. I did a GM\u2019s cheat sheet for Sci-Fi Beta Kappa, and I\u2019m wondering if this could be used similarly. I agree, it\u2019s nice when designers summarise their systems easily and concisely. Probably a lot easier to do with story games than adventure-path behemoths though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449439/#Comment_449439" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-13T05:54:50+00:00" title="November 13, 2015  5:54AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looks pretty good, and makes me interested in reading it in more detail.

Lisa Meitner came off even worse,  she's practically Lego Woman, and Fermi's eyes are a bit on the pixelly side too, but don't worry, this is only the demo version, I'm going to hire a professional artist to do pencil sketches for 1st ed; however, I'll try to find a better Vitruvian Man for this one.<br/><br/>I'd be happy to show you the draft doc, but I've yielded to a very wise and experienced gamer buddy who told me to stop putting my game docs in the public domain before they've been playtested, hence another reason for the summary sheet. However, if you're interested I can send you what I've got so far, bearing in mind it's a working draft so the system may change between now and playtesting. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449459/#Comment_449459" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-13T20:23:19+00:00" title="November 13, 2015  8:23PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 22, 2015 7:52AM by catty_big.">edited November 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The front page Vitruvian man is super pixly, though.
