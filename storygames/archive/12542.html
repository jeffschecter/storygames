A bell curve, usually generated by rolling several dice and adding them, open ended dice mechanisms are another bell curve mechanism, can focus results on a narrow range. Note that D&amp;Ds many rolls to resolve combat basically turn the single D20 roll into a bell curve.

The idea is, what difference in skill (between skill and target) makes the outcome certain, or as near as makes little difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn D20, the eponymous die sums up the 'certainty' for a single roll. For a fight, however, the difference is probably much lower.<br/>\nIn Feng Shui, a certainty is about 5 points of AV.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found it handy for thinking about what range of ability is allowed from the bottom to the top of a system, and how the balance between randomness and attributes is truck.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with your questions is that there's no correct answer to either. It all depends on what feel you want for a game. If it's madcap, or cinematic, the 'ideal' balance will skew towards randomness. In a game with a lot of careful planning or investigation, it skews the other way. Too little randomness can risk making everything seem rote, and you might as well ditch the randomiser altogether. Too much, and the defining characteristics of a character might not seem to matter, or promote buckshot play where you keep trying things until something sticks. Even in a given milieu, it's highly subjective.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281586/#Comment_281586" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-19T08:06:22+00:00" title="July 19, 2010  8:06AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1.

The way the basic "set" mechanics work, each increase in skill matters less than the previous one. That is, there is a diminishing return on raising your skill. But... as you raise your skill, the more you can do at once (that is, more skill means more opportunity for multiple sets, which ORE uses for multiple actions, sort of). So, skill always matters... and luck always matters.

So the probability of hitting with an attack bonus of +1 vs AC of 10 is identical to attack bonus of 31 vs AC of 40.

You need to look at the random factor as a percentage of the range of differences in difficulties.<br/><br/>The cumulative nature of D&amp;D style combat is also very important. For Cold Iron, a college friends game which has a mechanic that enables use of the real normal distribution curve (the "ideal" bell curve), my friend developed a computerized combat simulator, that would take two opponents and have them slug it out until one went down, and ran the same combat repeatedly. Despite the standard deviation of the randomizer being about 7 (actually 20/3), a single point of difference in combat rating resulted in the higher rated combatant winning I think 60% of the time. This is actually a HUGE swing. So a pretty large randomizer (it's actually sort of similar to a D20 in that there's about a 5% chance of at least a +10, so if the scale was changed from -10 to +10 to 1 to 20, a 1 and a 20 would have about the same 5% chance of occurrence that they have on a D20 - sort of), combats are actually fairly predictable. Yet, there is always the chance for a 1st level character to kill a 10th level character in a single blow.<br/><br/>Now if instead, the D20 roll was a single roll to resolve a conflict, then the predictability would be much lower, even if our ratings are such that on a 16+ I win and on a 15- you win, there's still a 25% chance I win despite our ratings being 5 difference (take a look at RuneQuest/Basic Role Playings resistance chart for this example - even though it uses D100, but in 5% increments that basically mimic a D20).<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281894/#Comment_281894" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-20T12:46:22+00:00" title="July 20, 2010 12:46PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2010 12:48PM by migo.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've heard people talking about that with 4th Ed too - that once you get the hang of it you can predict where combat will go, how many rounds each enemy will survive, and the like, and there's very little surprise to be had. I'm thinking that bit about it being dependent on a single roll makes things much more random is why 4E went for skill challenges, which strikes me as an unnecessarily drawn out dice pool, and in a sense with the number of rolls to hit using a d20 for a combat, it could rather easily be handled with a dice pool in a single roll as a means of conflict resolution rather than task resolution.<br/><br/>Speaking of dice pools, I find they have much more consistent and predictable results on a single roll/action basis, which might be an answer to the OP.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282588/#Comment_282588" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-23T06:44:31+00:00" title="July 23, 2010  6:44AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ffilz</cite>Yet, there is always the chance for a 1st level character to kill a 10th level character in a single blow.</blockquote>\nCan this happen in D&amp;D 4E?

However, it's really each player's choices that matter: what kinds of Raises will you make? When are willing to Take the Blow? And when (and how often) are you willing to escalate?<br/><br/>The dice just lay out the landscape within which those choices are made.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282838/#Comment_282838" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-25T19:53:14+00:00" title="July 25, 2010  7:53PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DavidVS</cite>I like lots of dice, so my favorite idea is to use die sizes as both skill ratings and difficulty ratings.
