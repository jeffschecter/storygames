Just the popular ones I played. Plenty lesser known games were like Settlers before Settlers.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when I finally played Settlers I was immediately hooked. It's fast, easy to learn, finishes in 90 minutes, streamlined, relatively quick to set up, it's unclear who will win till the very end, and no matter whose turn it is, you have a compelling reason to pay attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it didn't have that rule I dislike in boardgames where if X happens, you lose your next turn. Which is effectively losing 2 turns. Add this to an already slow game where when it isn't your turn you don't do anything and I was instantly turned off.<br/>\n<br/>\nSettlers was not what I was used to.

One of these roles is the assassin. The assassin's turn always comes early in the round, and the assassin is entitled to "shoot" any one of the later roles. The player with that role then loses their turn.<br>\n<br>\nIt's only one turn lost, not two, since the other player doesn't have to roll badly or land on a "lose a turn" space before the lost turn takes effect. But it's still a significant handicap.

One thing I have noticed about Euro-games in that limited experience, is that they seem to have multiple paths to winning in a way that Ameritrash games don't. I've also noticed a tendency to have different strategies depending upon what stage of the game players are in.<br/><br/>Strangely, also, I've usually also been right in there and competing until the last with Eurogames, and am left with a strong urge to shake my opponents hand and say something like "Damn-Good Game Old Bean!!!" and mean it at the end of Euro-games in a way I don't feel in Ameritrash games. <br/><br/>I suspect that has to do with some mechanical effect where competing until the last in Eurogames actually has some change of pulling off at least a close loss, where Ameritrash games tend to have a long slow death for the loser(s) that's inevitable and foreseeable, but they don't have a point where you can honorably admit to the loss without seeming a whiner and undercutting the winner's win.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268467/#Comment_268467" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-23T03:02:14+00:00" title="April 23, 2010  3:02AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Citadels can be quite brutal!

In the end, though, he did quite well, and when we played it again while sober, he seemed to have subliminally absorbed the rules.
