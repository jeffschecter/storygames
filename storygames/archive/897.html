<a href="http://www.koplowgames.com/catalogcover.html" rel="nofollow">And here it is!</a><br/><br/>These are the guys that I used to get me all those Japanese (Kanji/Hansi) dice. There's lots of new ones around this year as well, on the cover alone!<br/><br/>Dice with scarabs on them (for The Roach!)<br/><br/>d10s enumerated in the 100s, 1,000s, 10,000s and 100,000s, for those of you making Final Fantasy style games, they might be looking into for damage!<br/><br/>Feel free to go through it and share your thoughts.<br/><br/>I'm digging the yellow non-precision casino dice on page 5.<br/><br/>On page six, there are "Astrological dice". I have one that someone gave me years ago and have always been thinking about something to do with it.  Maybe somehow spin it into Ninegun Choir?<br/><br/>P9: Cosmic... Wimpout... Dice?  Never heard of it.<br/><br/>P12: L, C, R dice.  A deeper strategy mechanic for AGON?<br/><br/>P 16: Emotidice.  Fun-ky<br/><br/>When I see all the animal dice on page 18, I think of a game where you play a Highlander-like Spirit Warrior, and roll 10 of these every roll (all of them are the dice of your "spirit totem": The number One (the animal) is the number of successes.  Watch Iron Crab duel against the Peat Frog and Monster Flamingo!<br/><br/>P29: d6s with only colors on them!  Might be great to implement into that 24-Hour game Divinity!<br/><br/>Page 31:  Compass direction dice, so you can keep track of which direction you fall or drown!<br/><br/>Page 32: Math Dice. This will make Ben's brain fire like the Fourth of July with bizarre-ass ideas, I bet!                </div>

                            Cosmic Wimpout is a dice game that enjoys great popularity among hippies. Just google it, or search google groups.<br/><br/>And man, that is one butt-ugly website. Hey, Koplow! It's called PHP. Or hell, CGI Perl. Or Ruby on Rails. Fuck, man, <i>anything</i> besides just scanning in your frickin' printed catalog.<br/><br/>Oh well. I guess that's wholesale.<br/><br/>You know what I really want? Twelve-sided dice with the parallelogram faces. Those suckers <i>tesselate</i>. How cool is that? But they don't seem to exist.<br/><br/>For those of you who haven't gotten enough dice fetish, www.advancinghordes.com seems to have about the biggest selection, including the vaunted Gamescience dice, dice for <i>real gamers</i>, none of this pansy file-off-the-dangerous-edges crap. Dice you could <i>cut yourself</i> on, by God. And <i>accurate</i>. Plus they're truly jewel-like and really pretty.<br/><br/>Does anyone still make the d20 that's 0-9 twice? You had to colour them in with different markers to distinguish 1-10 and 11-20? We favoured the silver markers back in my day, that had a colour shade under them (if you wrote on paper it would outline the silver). You had to get a drop in the number just so and it would fill it up. <i>Old school</i>, is what I'm sayin' here. Reprazent.                        </div>

                            First of all - I have to say that simply looking at all of the dice in that catalog is kinda scary, frankly.  <br/><br/>And yeah - not having an e-commerce site?  Dumb.  I mean it's wholesale, but come on.<br/><br/>My take:<br/><br/>p.26: A die in a die and three dice inside a die?  THAT'S AWESOME.  I imagine it being used with SteveD's TINS - the outer die is the Override Stat, the inner one is the ability stat.  Then it's clear when the override stat wins in a single roll.<br/><br/>p.27: d20 double dice?!? OMFG - they'd be perfect for <i>Elsewhere</i>.<br/><br/>p.31: Compass dice for an exploration game.  "This expedition is heading south!  Literally!"<br/><br/>p.32 - Roman Numeral dice.  Alea iacta est!<br/><br/>p. 37: Place value dice - the 12-siders - for a game like DC Heroes where you have the logarithmic numbers involved.  "I just rolled 6 million 2 hundred thousand!"  Also - the math operator ones are really interesting on a visceral level, but I'm not sure how you'd make them work.<br/><br/>Also  - the parts of speech and interrogative sets have a lot of potential.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how the 30-sided alphabet ones work - all the consonants plus each vowel twice (including y) is 32.  Consonants + vowels*2 and counting y as a consonant gives you 31.                        </div>

                            I'm really a diceless kind of guy, but some of those make me drool at the thought of all the design possibilities....<br/>
<br/>
In another thread which I can't just now locate, we mentioned dominoes. Thinking about this tonight, I realized some of the things you could do with dominoes as a substitute for dice - some of which you can't do with dice. Dominoes are of course based on the possible rolls of 2d6, and the Chinese ones are still just that, but the Western dominoes add a "blank" - which makes them 2d7. So if you needed a d7 roll for some reason (7 being an evocative number in many contexts), you can draw a domino and take, say, the left half. <br/>
<br/>
Also quite common are domino sets that go from blank to 9, which gives you 2d10 (or 2d9 if you remove the blanks before you start, or d9 if you just take one half as above). You could even use them for percentiles, but you'd have to toss a coin or otherwise have some way of determining which side you read as 10s and which as units. <br/>
<br/>
And if you needed some other weird random number generated, like 13s or something, you could make your own set of dominoes to do it with.                        </div>

                            P. 37: "Interrogative dice"; the six sides say Who/What/Where/When/Why/How. Someone's gotta do something with that.

                            I currently have, about a tenth baked, a turn-taking storytelling game where each player makes a one-sentence statement ("In the rain at 3am, a man in a fedora and a long raincoat is standing smoking under a streetlight at the corner of Main and Third") and then turns to the next player and asks an open question - the next player's statement having to be an answer to that question which fits in with all the statements made so far. The interrogative dice would be prime for this. <br/>
<br/>
On my earlier post - it was late (my time), I'd just logged in to reboot a server and was checking the forum while the server came up. That's my excuse for forgetting that we already have a "d13". It's called playing cards. But the principle remains: Want a funny random number range, consider using dominoes.                        </div>

                            Koplow has d20 numbered 0-9 twice. Of course they're pre-inked. Unfortunately, Koplow dice have a poor pattern in my mind. Originally, the 0-9 twice D20s had each pair on opposite sides. The Koplow dice have some pairs adjacent. Back in college, I was getting suspicious of the pair of Koplow dice I was using, and made myself a 10x10 grid and then proceeded to roll the pair 1000 times. The distribution came up rather uneven. Then I noticed that 7 which was one of the numbers that came up way more than it should have, was also one of the pairs right next to each other. My Koplow dice were carefully quarantined after that.<br/>
<br/>
I wish it was still easy to get decent 0-9 twice dice because I'd rather ban the use of d10s. I just don't trust their "non-roundness."<br/>

<p>Yeah, 20-sided d10s roll better because they are Platonic solids. One of the elder nerds I know has a bunch, including types with a little "+" on half the sides. (And similar d30s with "-" too.)</p>
<p>Andy, you know where I can score actual Japanese dice? Not kanji, but with the huge 1 pip and 4 in a different color.</p>
<p>I remember those Qlabs dice seemed temping. I seemed to recall they had a cool one that looked conspicuously tailored for Burning Wheel.</p>
<p>These days I have mostly given up on pretty dice in favor of high contrast dice.</p>

                            This weekend, one of my players discovered a badly stamped d4 (the kind with the value one each apex). Two of the triangle faces were swapped so that the possible results, reading around the three apexes, were 1-1-2, 2-2-1, 3-3-4, and 4-4-3. That is, it wasn't entirely apparently which result you'd rolled.                        </div>

                            Larry - of course it isn't purely the case that a platonic solid rolls better than any other solid. A d4 rolls pretty badly (which is why I love my Gamescience 8-sided d4s). The d24 and d30, while non-platonic, probably roll pretty good.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, the other one I hate, I've seen some stretched d8s which make them just as bad as the d10 in my mind.<br/>
<br/>
Those cylinder style dice may be ok, but you have to make sure that you toss them such that they actually roll.<br/>

                            My favorite d4 is a twelve-sided die marked with Roman numerals. Amusingly enough, I didn't realize that it wasn't a d12 until I started using it much later.<br/><br/>MDK                        </div>
