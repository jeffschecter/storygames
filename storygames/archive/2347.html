                    hey i just wanted to start a little thread on what i've been thinking about, and i wanted to get some other input on it.  why aren't more small press rpgs self contained?  what i mean by that is, why don't more games come with everything you need to play them?  is it just cheaper to market?  has anyone broken it down to see how much would, let's say The Shadow of Yesterday be if it included FUDGE dice?   what about Spirit of the Century?  heck, what about including some presorted LEGOs for Mechaton?  is this at all cost effective?<br/>and for games with a big learning curve, why hasn't anyone done an audio/visual rulebook(dvd)?<br/>i wonder if Brennan considered marketing a "cheap-ass" version of the game and then a more complete version.<br/>how many people would play Monopoly if they had to buy the dice and markers seperately?  i wonder?<br/>i can see not including traditional playing cards or six-siders.  but has anyone tried to get FUDGE dice recently?  <br/><br/>-nathan                </div>

                            I will testify that we played Spirit of the Century Friday with 3 fudge dice and a D6 modified to play with. My FLGS has been trying to get me more for about three weeks and the other one in town never heard of them.                        </div>

                            Hi Nate,<br/>
<br/>
There was a version of Mechaton you could get with Legos, at Gen Con. It makes like 4 or 5 proper mechs but we've made 10 with the set. I imagine the other thing is most gamers have dice. Although fudge dice are hard to get ahold of without specifically ordering them.                        </div>

                            From the publisher side of things, there is a lot of hassle involved with making your product more than "a book." Believe me, I've been thinking about alternate artifact forms for months now, and the sticking point is always in making your product available to be sold.<br/><br/>Lets look at the simplest case: including dice with your game. This involves:<br/><br/>*Buying enough bulk dice at cost so you can sell them and ship them and still make some margin (assuming you want to make money off your sales - this is not universally the case).<br/><br/>*The time involved to sort dice into whatever quantity. This may be significant, actually, especially if your game uses a lot of different kinds of dice. <br/><br/>*Packaging the dice. Do you do a box set with your game book at the dice inside (box sets = another round of production costs and research and assembly time)? Put your dice in a plastic baggie? Heatshrink and tape it to the book? Ship them seperately?<br/><br/>*Can you afford to have all of your product pass through your hands on the way to retailers, distributors and resellers, assuming you use any of those services? If you're doing short digital print runs, is it worth the extra shipping and delay to have your printer ship your books to you, you attach the dice sets (or box them, or whatever), and then reship all of that to (for example) IPR or Key20?<br/><br/>None of this is impossible, but it's a lot of work and probably significant expense, especially when your game is marketed to a community that has dice ownership as a kind of assumed thing.<br/><br/>That said, look at Paul Czege - he sells <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=17208.0" rel="nofollow">dice sets for Bacchanel</a> (or at least he did). He has the advantages that he sells (as far as I know) entirely direct, which cuts out a lot of the expense and hassle.<br/><br/>Now, I'm saying all of this as someone who <i>badly</i> wants to be able to sell a book and have it have all you need for play in it, not as someone saying you shouldn't ever think about this. But, hopefully this can shed some light on the situation for you.                        </div>

                            The other reason there are no RPGs, small-press or otherwise, that come with everything you need to play (besides the D&amp;D Basic Game) is that retailers hate it. Boxes get crushed, and have to be shrinkwrapped such that potential buyers can't browse them.<br/><br/>That said, there certainly ought to be a few more niche products that have swanky or unique and handmade packaging, which move through other channels.                        </div>

                            I've said this three or four times now, that RPGs should come in boxes (like games), instead of books (like technical manuals).<br/><br/><br/>Don't Rest Your Head should come with character sheets, 4 blocks of dice (red, white, black, purple), two glass dishes (frosted and clear), despair tokens, the game book, some individual Nightmare sheets, with illustrations and stats and talents, and the materials for running a con game. It should all come in a box.<br/><br/>I think that indie games (which try to incorporate physicality into mechanics) should be doing this. We have games which involve sliding dice back and forth, but no "game mat", we sell games that involve point pools but they don't come with glass beads, and we sell games based on Fudge without the Fudge dice.<br/><br/>[url=<a href="http://www.decipher.com/lordoftherings/rpg/lotradvgamepkg.html]Decipher[/url]" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.decipher.com/lordoftherings/rpg/lotradvgamepkg.html]Decipher[/url]</a> did something similar, except that the Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Adventure Game is more of a gateway game - it includes pregens, dice, a scenario, and a walkthrough of how RPGs work (and it's a rope to try and sell you their full-on LotR game, but it's still a good example of someone actually doing this).                        </div>

                            Personally I love games like 'The Shab-al-Hiri Roach' and 'The Mountain Witch' that contain an insert envelope with cards for use in play.<br/><br/>But I agree that a box similar to 'Host a Murder Mystery' with everything you need to play a story game would be really nice.  And from a FLGS retail standpoint, it might actually get slotted somewhere other than the "Indie RPG" shelf in the back so a different set of customers could browse it.  I think box packaging would be key here as was noted above, there is no chance to flip through the materials of a shrink-wrapped box.  <br/><br/>The board and party game (i.e. Apples to Apples) market basically assumes that you will be able to open the box and start playing.  They just accept a higher component cost.  When you buy Formula De (racing board game) you get a board, rules, cool plastic cars and polyhedral dice!                        </div>

Well, yeah <i>RPG Conservatism</i>- if the looked like box games, people might treat them like games, not like roleplaying games.<br/><br/>Does anyone want to address the economic issues involved with this directly?<br/><br/>How much exactly does a box cost, from the cheapest pre-built thing to a sexy specially made thing?                        </div>

<p>You could print collectible mugs at Cafepress (do they still do mugs?) with rules for one character type on each mug, and a tea leaf reading resolution mechanic. But I see that more as a novelty than something I'd want to do regularly.</p>
<p>I think the opposite approach is more useful: design your game so that it uses as few external components, beside the book, as possible. Or, at least, the external components should be extremely common. That was what I was thinking when I designed that coin toss system; I figured anyone could pull three to five pennies out of their pockets and be ready to join a game. The most you would need to do is photocopy the play sheets, if necessary.</p>
<p>Another approach I've toyed with: I was thinking of ways to make my solo dungeoncrawl game potentially portable and thought: why not print dice images on the outside margin of the right-hand page? To roll one die, riffle through the pages and stop. The game won't work as well as it will with dice, but it will be playable.</p>

                            John, there's a game that has that that I've read about. I think it's one of those games that people love to hate (like, Wraethlu, or something in that vein).<br/><br/>Dead of Night has a random-number generator in the back, like the old Grey Wolf solo-adventure books.                        </div>

<p>I thought of that, too. But, if you have your book open to pages 62 and 63, which number do you use?</p>
<ul>
<li>if you use the tens digit, you have the potential for players to bias their "roll" by stopping early or late.</li>
<li>if you use the ones digit, which page indicates the result?</li>
</ul>
<p>You have two options to make the results more reliable: only use odd results (or even results) and build that into the system, or print your dice in the margins. I already need results of 0-9 for this game, which makes the choice seem obvious to me.</p>

God lord man, don't worry about being looked at as a curmudgeon, hit us wwith some cold, hard numbers!!!<br/><br/>If you've looked into it, tell us what you found out. That way, all of us can start scheming. <br/><br/>It's the unknown that's scary. Once known, things can be dealt with. Please, do tell me more about it. What were the costs, the hassles, the price points?<br/><br/>Individually, I doubt any small producer could pick up the tab. But, I regularly deal with folks in a co-op mindset. maybe this is something exploitable?<br/><br/>What did it look like? Where were the sweet spots on numbers? How much were 40 card sets? Was there a way to reduce costs compared to projected sales?                        </div>

                            Robert, here's some quick numbers, gleaned from net searches.<br/><br/>Indie roleplaying books in the UK cost, very very roughly, between 7 and 15 pounds. So, if you were selling a boxed game, you'd want to be <i>somewhere</i> around that range.<br/><br/>Let's say you wanted to do it as cheaply as possible.<br/><br/>Boxes start at about a pound. For that, you'd get a cheap, corrugated cardboard box, good for sending through the post and dull to look at: think Cheapass Games, but a bit bigger. You'd want to put labels on it, or a little cardboard sleeve, or something, to make it look professional, but it'd be OK.<br/><br/>Now, if you're using a box, let's assume you've got dice or counters or something in it too. Dice and playing pieces are, very roughly, 10p each. A griplock bag to put them in is about 5p. So, a couple of dice in a bag is 25p; a bag of 20 counters is around two pounds.<br/><br/>Then there's the book. Perhaps you'd want to print it. Since it's in a box, you could probably get away with just paper, folded in half and stapled down the middle: like a board game instruction leaflet. <br/><br/>Then add a bit for shipping all of that stuff to you so you can put it together.<br/><br/>It's <i>possible</i>, I think, to put the game together for about five pounds, and it'd look <i>okay</i>. And you'd be able to sell people a boxed game, ready to go. Of course, for that price, you could have a book which looked much slicker. But still.<br/><br/>(This is all speculative, so experienced publishers are welcome to rip my figures apart.)<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Wow. Since it's that much of a hassle, why did RPG publishers almost always do it anyway through the 80s or so (feel free to correct me on dates and such)?                        </div>

                            There's an economy of scale, for sure.  Beyond that I don't exactly know - some of it may have been consumer expectations emerging from wargames, where a box makes a lot of sense.  You'll notice that, whatever the reason, it largely stopped happening at a certain point.  Boxed sets are nice and I've always enjoyed them- I bought a boxed set of Call of Cthulhu (which cost a heart-stopping $20) that was packed with awesome, back in the day.<br/><br/>BTW I'm trying to round up our numbers to share.                        </div>

                            Also remember, Neko-and-Jason, that you're talking about the pre-POD days of printing, where books were significantly more expensive to make, so thus a boxed set would not have been as much <em>more</em>.                        </div>

                            Joshua -- that's inaccurate.  Books are (and always have been) cheaper on an offset printer.  They were simply only available in larger amounts, which has nothing to do with the cost of boxes, etc.<br/><br/>I'm poking vaguely at a "starter kit" for Bliss Stage with 20-25 Fudge dice, the book, a pad of useful sheets (character sheets, group sheets, mission sheets, and hope sheets), and a quickstart guide.  I'm thinking that to save on boxes and assembly nonsense, it would probably be available only through mail-order (sans box) or maybe at cons where I can assemble a few kits.  It would cost about $50-70, roughly the same price as role-playing box sets from the early eighties (factoring inflation.)<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>

                            Ben, would it be possible to have a price breakdown of that starter kit? You've obviously thought about how much those individual elements will cost and how much to sell it for. Any chance you could take us through that?<br/><br/>Alternatively, if anyone else has a similar breakdown, that would be good.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            See, I put "POD" in there as shorthand, and I knew I shouldn't have.  Books are cheaper to make now than they ever were, thanks to a host of new technologies which is commonly and inappropriately called "POD technologies".  One of the larger differences is in creating plates directly from the computer, rather than shooting film.  There are better ink regulators now.  There are others.  Point being, new printing technology makes books lots easier to make than boxed sets today; back in the early 80s, the difference wasn't so extreme and thus a boxed set was a more viable alternative to 'just a book'.  Today, the margin is wider, and it's a greater financial risk to do a boxed set as opposed to a book -- a risk that some folks are willing to consider, sure, but a risk, nonetheless.                        </div>

That's a very good point, but packaging is an interesting question too.<br/><br/>Hrm. A split packaging approach, depending on whether the game was going to end up on store shelves or be sold from the author's own home site?                        </div>

<p>I think this idea hasn't been <em>rejected</em> by the people who have considered it â€” we're just waiting for it to be fully feasible. If something's supposed to be self-contained, there are a lot more elements to it and the interactions between those elements are more complex.</p>
<p>Here's a thought: Steve Jackson Games used to sell these little plastic boxes. Car Wars came like this, and it was great; I could jam it in my pocket and take it over to my friend's house. I don't know where they got those boxes, if they were custom manufactured, or what. But DVD cases have a slot to hold a modest book and many types have a removable disk nipple. You could put small dice, sheets, even pencils in there with ease. I think the biggest challenge with these is that they look like DVDs. That presents a real challenge when marketing them. It has to be <em>really</em> clear that it's not a DVD. Maybe put the box sideways or something.</p>

                            OtherJoshua has the right idea, here.  It's not in getting a custom-made box for your purposes; it's finding a box that's already made in massive numbers and figuring how to use it for your game.  I mean, remember when blank CDs were expensive?  Now they're not, cause they're mass-produced.                        </div>

                            I suspect Joshua's right that using already available materials instead of trying to have custom ones made is going to be more feasible.  We're planning a box set for <i>Four Nations</i> and one plan was to find boxes that already exist and just print a cardboard or paper strip to wrap around the box with the name of the game on it, like 1/3 of a sleeve or slipcase.  There's plenty of different types of boxes out there, you'd think that you could find some appropriate ones without too much work.<br/><br/>Edit: Crossposted with JBR.                        </div>

                            Regarding the price point, I think it's useful to point out that when people buy a boxed game they expect to pay more. To me the idea of boxed sets is not about presenting a product to the existing market for the same cost that market expects to pay for a book -- it's about presenting a product to a different market that expects to pay significantly more for anything called a 'game.'<br/><br/>I mean, I don't know what Monopoly sells for now, but I bet it isn't $15. As Ben pointed out, the boxed sets of the 80s translate into current prices well above the usual indie game, and probably most mainstream RPGs as well. When I go to the game store to buy a board game as a gift, or for myself, I expect to pay at least $30 for prettymuch anything that comes in a box. Usually more. And yeah, some of those boxes will contain much prettier things than just a few dice, but still. The price target should not be compared to another indie RPG book, it should be compared to existing boxed set board games in the same way those indie books are compared to d20 or White Wolf stuff.                        </div>

                            So here's the rough cost of things:<br/>25 custom dice: $10<br/>The actual book: $7<br/>Color quickstart book: $5<br/>Pads and stuff: not sure, haven't found a place that will make pads, but maybe just not looking hard enough.

                            Ben:<br/>Are there any ways to cut costs? For example, are custom dice essential? Does any of this cost come down with volume purchase? Can any of this be split with another game maker Co-Op style?                        </div>

                            What Mike said.  I see these as special products, like <i>untitled</i>.  Maybe someday they'll be easy to do on a shoestring budget, but not any time soon.  Selling 30-50 copies would be cool.  Retail is nuts.                        </div>

                            Probably not, Mike, but then shipping costs are also higher here with direct distro of a box and stuff. In any case, with Indie, you look for an even higher profit margin percentage than with distro. That is, to ensure profitability with an indie game sold direct, often you charge as much as 5 times your cost for the product. You're proposing droping the margin to less than 2 times. That's extra dangerous.<br/>

                            Mike:<br><br>There are only two reasons to do such a project.  The first is gamer nostalgia, which is an admirable goal but not really what I'm doing with Bliss Stage.  If I'm selling to veteran gamers (my primary market for online sales), I expect them to be able to provide the fudge dice, etc themselves.<br/><br/>The second is outreach to new people, so everything that they need to play is together under a single box.  This would be my goals with such a "quickstart kit."  For such a thing, it is absolutely essential to get it into toy stores, game stores, comic books stores, and special interest anime stores.  Since the core book is my only product (there never will be a "line") I'm not willing to take a loss on sales to stores.<br/><br/>Bob: That's exactly it.  My conclusion is not "this is impossible."  It's simply, "I don't know if this is feasible or not."  Whether or not it is feasible will depend exactly on how many corners I can cut whilst still keeping it a saleable product.  What I am saying is that it is unrealistic to sell an RPG boxed set for under $50 -- the economics now are not so different from the economics of the 1980s, and that's the same cost modified for inflation.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </br></br></div>

                            I read an anecdote once that when TSR finally got a good accountant to look at their business, they came back with a good news/ bad news report.  Good news: We finally know exactly how much a boxed set costs to produce.  Bad news: It costs more than we've been charging for it. <br/><br/>That said, I suspect there's room in the market for well-respected game designers to market a limited edition of their game, with all the necessary widgets and some additional cool stuff, for a big ol' markup.  <br/><br/>Using Ben's last post as an example, I probably wouldn't buy a quickstart kit for Bliss Stage, I've got Fudge dice and stuff.  I might buy <b>Bliss Stage: the Neon Edition</b>,if such a thing were to exist and if I had sufficient disposable income that month.                        </div>

                            Seems like there's a couple reasons to include everything you need to play:<br/><br/>1) Accessibility for non-gamers.<br/>2) You need special stuff to play. Like, y'know, the roulette wheel in <i>Fastlane</i>.<br/><br/>Frex, Ben's boxed set of <i>Bliss Stage</i> is not exciting to me.  I only need the book to play and don't need the other stuff, but I could see how that might look like a more attractive buy to non-gamers.  But if Ben designed a game that required special stuff, I might pay a bunch of money for that, as long as the special stuff made play awesome and weren't just gimmicky things.                        </div>

                            See, here's what it comes down to for me: we're talking a lot of effort, a lot of expense, and a higher ticket price for the end customer.  And what I'm not seeing is much increased value or utility in such a product.  I mean seriously, we're talking dice and pads of character sheets.  They'd have to be <em>really cool</em> dice and <em>really cool</em> character sheets that I couldn't just download and print myself... otherwise, what's the point?<br/><br/>And before you answer, "gamer proselytizism" or "getting games in the hands of non-gamers" then you've got a MUCH bigger problem, and one that Ben points out, of getting this hypothetical box in places where non-gamers will pick it up and buy it.  If you can solve that problem, putting the stuff in a box is cake.                        </div>

                            Well lots of this seems to come down to <br/>Volume<br/>Slow Build Up<br/>Broader markets once buyers are familiar with your products and are confident about them<br/><br/>Maybe an indie designer/seller simply can't do this staright out of the gate. Maybe an indie guy will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">never</span> be able to do it. I'm just looking at the idea that this needs to be examined, not taken as a given.<br/><br/>Right now, though, the only market for these games that use gamer components are gamers and only a subset of those.<br/><br/>Believe me, as someone interested in miniatures game designs, I feel for anyone trying to get even a decent box and some dice together at a reasonable cost. I do think that there are some other possibilities worth exploring.<br/><br/>If there are 6 designers, all of whom are making a game that uses d10s maybe it's worth considering grouping up rather than having each of those designers either skip the d10s altogether or try to pay the higher cost-per die that is  associated with a small order. Does every designer need a shrinkwrap machine of their own? Can standardized boxes be bought at a lower bulk purchase price? These are all real-world possibilities.<br/><br/>Just sayin'                        </div>

                            It may also pay to do some market research (anybody going to an anime con soon?) and actually ask non-gamers what non-gamers would want/need out of a game product.                        </div>

                            There's also getting the game to non-gamers.<br/><br/>Off the bat, this is what I'm thinking of:<br/>Anyone with an interest in the same subject matter as that of the game.<br/><br/>Anyone who supports small independant craftspeople/indie publishers of any kind.<br/><br/>An E-Bay presence. Does anyone sell their games on E-Bay? Does IPR have an E-Bay store?<br/><br/>Tangent:<br/>Has anyone explored the possibility of making the money off the pieces instead of the text?<br/><br/>Ben said:<br/>"What I am saying is that it is unrealistic to sell an RPG boxed set for under $50 -- the economics now are not so different from the economics of the 1980s, and that's the same cost modified for inflation."<br/><br/>I dunno. Something about that equation is hinky. I bought Arkham Horror last year, off the shelf for $50+tax.<br/><br/>Right now, my Erol Otus Cover Basic D&amp;D set is on a shelf near it.<br/><br/>Somehow, I can't be brought to believe that those two should both sell for $50 if they were modern contemporaries.<br/><br/>Something doesn't match up.<br/><br/>Again, it may be as simple as the fact that a sigle person operation with realistic monetary resources simply can't put up the money to do a full on boxed set, especially starting out.                        </div>

                            Ok, since I'm actually in the middle of doing this, I'll talk. First, see the <a href="http://cc.crngames.com/inuma" rel="nofollow">game-in-a-container</a>. You've got three books, 20 custom dice, 100 stones, a bag, and some character sheets, with room for pencils and other stuff.<br/><br/>There's plenty of reasons to do this:<br/><br/>1) You're not making an RPG. This is a great reason to do this. When I try to explain to other people that I make games, they see my books and think they're the instructions to the game, and wonder where the game is. Only role-players have a built-in expectation that a game comes in a book.<br/><br/>2) Your game requires custom components. My dice are not available in stores, so I have to include them.<br/><br/>2a) Your game requires a lot of components. I have three books.<br/><br/>3) You want a distinctive look.<br/><br/>4) You're not planning on making a ton of these. In my case, I plan to produce 50 sets and then see if it's feasible to make more. Each set will probably retail at $65 or 70.<br/><br/>To make something like this affordable, you have to think of new ways to produce. My dice are wooden blocks, bought in bulk super-cheaply and then painted through a revolutionary new process I invented.                        </div>

                            Joe,<br/><br/>All of this is uncertain right now. The box I'm using is from a local craft store, but for production, I'm hoping to get boxes from <a href="http://www.dahou.com/" rel="nofollow">Dahou Wooden Box Company</a>, which has my favorite website of the week. The time is really in the dice manufacturing, which is about 3 hours/set, although that was for the first set, and I bet I could increase that to about 1 hour/set.<br/><br/>In my rough current estimation, I will end up paying:<br/><br/>$5-9 : box<br/>$5 : stones<br/>$1.50 - 2 : dice<br/>$6-8 : 3 books<br/>$1 : included character sheets<br/><br/>That's $25 on the high side and $18.50 on the low side, which is super-expensive. Add shipping for components and sending to, say, IPR, and that's putting me around $27/copy. The time involved will be 1-2 hours per set, which, at a pretty minimal wage, is about $11 of my time, putting the base cost at $38.<br/><br/>At this point, the economics are insane, which is why I decided, screw it, this is my art project instead of a business venture.                        </div>

                            I wonder if we're overlooking something here. The value of something like Ben's proposed <b>Bliss Stage: Perfect Collection</b> box might be in the way it enables "influentials" to increase <i>Bliss Stage</i>'s penetration. Here, in a box, is everything you need to play. Your game club, anime club, whatever, spreads the cost over multiple people and over time.<br/><br/>This is how it works for wargames today, mostly. This is how it works for miniatures gaming. There are a few people who spend a LOT of money to have the cool thing. They are the evangelists for the hobby, because people see the cool artifact and want to play with it. They may never buy the high-price-point toys themselves, but they buy the $15 book, etc. so they can play with the other guy's toys. Clubs and the like purchase the toys out of pooled funds, so that they have a draw to recruit people.<br/><br/>$75 is competitive with lots of things people spend hobby money on. You just can't market it like you would a book. You market it (a) as a cool artifact in its own right, something that people will notice and want to ask about/play with, and (b) something that's meant to be purchased/used by a <b>group</b>.                        </div>

                            Mark, <br/><br/>These are interesting points. <br/><br/>It's also worth nothing that that's about how it works in my life with, say, Days of Wonder games. I play those things with just about everyone in my life, and when people see the boxes they often want to know what its about, and when I get excited about it, want to play. <br/><br/>It's also worth noting that it'd change the assumed dynamic of purchase from that RPGs traditionally hold. Many RPG publishers (I don't know about Indie folks expectations) want everyone in the group to buy at least the core book for their RPG. Board game publishers, otoh, know that most of the time one box is going to get shared around the whole group -- and not just the people playing at any given time, but all their friends who borrow the box too. <br/><br/>When I want to play Ticket to Ride: Europe I never actually think about buying the game. I think about borrowing my sister-in-law's copy.                        </div>

                            Unless your game is completely killer, Brand.  I know I've helped sell copies of Carcassonne to people who could borrow mine if they wanted.  Settlers, M44, TTR, BattleLore, Bang!, the list goes on.  This works with RPGs, too - my weekly group is poised to place a massive Shadow of Yesterday order, and you can get that <i>free</i> if you want.  But it's killer.                        </div>

                            More data points on box costs: <i>Pieces of Eight</i> boxes (4 color + coating set-up boxes, roughly 6" x 9" x .5") eventually cost about $.66/ea, not including set-up costs (about $500 for the print run) and freight (widely variable depending on the distance from the manufacturer to you). We also got many higher quotes. This was for a run in mid-thousands.<br/><br/>If you're looking for stock packaging to which you can apply labels or sleeves or what-have-you, lots of companies do this. See, for example, the <a href="http://www.greatlittlebox.com" rel="nofollow">Great Little Box Company</a>. Of course, custom-printing sleeves just gets you more of the same problem you were trying to avoid by using stock boxes.                        </div>

                            Jason, <br/><br/>I don't think you get more killer than Ticket to Ride, Shadows Over Camelot, Carcassonne etc. And those are the games I'm talking about -- folks don't pick them up when someone else in the group has them. <br/><br/>RPGs are different. I have TSOY print, and so do several folks in my group, despite both being able to borrow mine and it being free online. <br/><br/>Now why they are different, that's an interesting question, but trust me -- from this little data point over here, they are.                        </div>

This is also the case with everyone I know. If we have a hot board game, especially if it is large and annoying to carry, most of us want to make sure we have it at each of our houses. The other thing is many people I know play RPGs in 1 location but boardgames all over the place.                        </div>

                            Absolutely you should do this. <br/><br/>I can't think of any reason why you wouldn't, actually, especially if there are a few different things.<br/><br/>Like this:<br/><br/>What You Will Need <br/>Playing the Game of Masks requires the following equipment:<br/>1.	A standard pack of playing cards.<br/>2.	A standard Western set of 28 dominoes ("double six" - the ones which go from blank to six pips). <br/>3.	A number of "Face" and â€œHidden Faceâ€ tokens per player, perhaps 20-30 of each. These can be poker chips, draughts/checkers/backgammon pieces, plastic discs, glass beads, dried beans or whatever is available. Stacking ones (like poker chips or draughts) are probably best, as it is easy to compare quantities based on how tall the piles are.<br/>4.	One relationship tracking sheet per player (see the end of these instructions).<br/>5.	Optionally, cardboard masks (or distinctive hats) to act as signals of which mask your character is wearing. You should decorate these with symbols indicating the characterâ€™s qualities.<br/>6.	A number of players preferably between about 5 and 10. Fewer than 5 will provide little scope for webs of relationships, while more than 10 will slow the game too much. <br/><br/>(From City of Masks.)                        </div>
