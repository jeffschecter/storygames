It's not the type of design I'm into because I don't like simulationist RPGs, but if you like most RPGs being published by the big publishers you'll probably like the system. Tone wise SOTDL was an attempt to go into the more dark fantasy area, but I think that if you want this type of game tone (in the simulationist arena) ZWEIH\xc4NDER Grim &amp; Perilous RPG is by far your best bet. I'm not sure if ZWEIH\xc4NDER Grim &amp; Perilous RPG is out yet though. If you want a Story Game, of course, you would want to go a different direction.
