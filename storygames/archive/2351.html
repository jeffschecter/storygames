<p>So, uh, this is a lame form of bibliomancy, I suppose. I'm just going to talk about different possibilities here.</p>
<p>One that springs to mind is, you name a number and flip the book open. You can derive results from how different the named number and the page numbers that appear are.</p>

<p>I think that would work better if, say, you picked an odd digit (1,3,5,7,9) and ignored the tens digit for the page number. You could generate a couple different results this way: Four Away, Two Away, or Dead On.</p>
<p>Another possibility is a specially-designed book where you flip to any (even) page in the middle and read the results on the page. This would be good as a variant on the old "Choose Your Own Adventure" books.</p>

                            A game where the page number itself is mechanically significant. When it's resolution time, the GM starts riffling through the book. As soon as the player comes up with an appropriate response, the GM stops and sees what page he's on, then compares/add/subtracts/etc. that number to a number on the character sheet or a challenge rating or something. The idea is that the longer you wait, the worse it gets.<br/><br/>EDIT: Obviously, this would only work in a frenetic, fast-paced game.                        </div>

                            If we're thinking of unusual approaches, how about an animated flipbook image that you stop as close to a specific point (based on your intent) as possible.  The image would go through, say, four different transformations.                        </div>

                            You could have a few different numbering systems going on throughout the pages. I'm thinking specifically of the overlapping cycles of the Mayan calender's days, months, years, centuries, millennia, and eons. The problem with page-flipping is that you need a fairly substantial page-count and your results are almost always going to be in the middle of the book. Also, the page-results could be influenced by subtle inconsistencies in the book's binding, but I can see how you could make that a feature instead of a bug.                        </div>

                            The main difficulty with using page numbers is the ability to greatly influence the kind of number selected.  If you know you need a small or large number then you flip to the beginning or end of the book.  So the mechanic would have to divorce the size of the number from the result.  I presume that is why Shreyas proposed a naming a random number and then performing math with the page number to get a result but really that just delays the problem until the players know right combinations they need.  To really keep a sense of randomness you would need to reference a table that had results in random order that the numbers referred to so that a difference of 8 was a great success but an difference of nine meant instant death.<br/>
<br/>
A simpler possibility would be to simply add all the page numbers together into one number 24 becomes 6, page 117 becomes 9 that sort of thing and then compare that to your target number for success.<br/>
<br/>
Of course you could go completely bibliomancy and assign a tarot type meaning to each number so that page 62 means the situation is colored by Misfortune and Hope but then you still are able to accurately aim for the first meaning at least.<br/>

                            There's a thing here.

</div></blockquote>
<p>This fits in with Rich's idea, a little (if you assume each page had interpretations for the page number.) Also fits a little with what I'm actually using for that solo dungeoncrawl game I've been talking about. The reason I'm committed to the digits 0 through 9 is because I plan on grouping things that can be generated (monsters, treasures, traps, chamber types, and so on) in groups of ten, so that if the traps are on pages 20-29, and you roll a 7 for trap type, you look on page 27.</p>
<p>That doesn't seem to be what Shreyas wants, here, but there may be a problem with thread focus. Let me see if I can help refocus the thread. Shreyas has stated he wants to use page numbers to create results, but does not want to use gimmicks, like re-numbering or printing additional items on the page. Also, it should be something new, rather than something that's been used before, and it should not be merely forcing page-numbering into the mold of another procedure, like die-rolling. It should be something that uses the features of page-numbering in books to create results.</p>
<p>So maybe we can think of the features of page-numbering first.</p>
<ul>
<li>the numbers are sequential;</li>
<li>they're in a known range;</li>
<li>when a book is open, two page numbers are visible: even on the left side, odd on the right;</li>
<li>the units digit runs from 0 to 9 and repeats;</li>
<li>the tens digit does not repeat unless the book has more than 99 pages;</li>
</ul>
<p>Things you can do with pages of a book that give you a page number:</p>
<ul>
<li>let the book fall open at random, or flip it open at random, to a pair of pages;</li>
<li>riffle the pages and look at the page number, which will have an even or odd bias;</li>
<li>compare another number to the previous two results;</li>
<li>add a number to the first two results, or to the current page number, to get a new number;</li>
<li>do another calculation, like convert to modulo 9 (the numerology trick Rich mentions;)</li>
<li>adjust number using some kind of look-up table (also mentioned by Rich.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Things you can use those techniques for:</p>
<ul>
<li>compare result to a target number;</li>
<li>look up result in a table (includes using memorized tables, like numerological qualities;)</li>
<li>move sequentially through pages, skipping numbers based on results.</li>
</ul>
<p>What are we missing, as far as page features, page-number manipulations, or applications?</p>

                            It would have to do something different to dice in order to be worth doing, so I don't think "how can we make a book act like dice" is going to go anywhere useful.  I mean, page-flicking is pretty inefficient as unbiased random number generation goes, so don't use it for that - play to its strengths.  <br/><br/>What strengths are those?<br/><br/>Ah.  <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Awkward</span> good question.  All I can come up with is if page numbers had a significance beyond simply being a number; page 34 is a page in a book - presumably <i>a</i> particular book - and that page has <i>stuff</i> on it and that stuff matters somehow.  How to do it?  Another <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">awkward</span> good question.<br/><br/>Constructive?                        </div>

                            Hmmm.  A mechanic that allows a player to greatly influence the number generated but still benefits from randomness.  <br/>
<br/>
Well for task resolution, the main thing I came up with is to turn what would be a dice roll in other systems to a mini-game involving the book.  A target number is named, the book is flipped, the player tries to stop his flipping as close to the target number as he can and how close he or she got determines the success of the action.  Skills and stats would determine the range of success so a guy with a strength of 10 has a twenty page span around the target number that he is aiming for.  I am picturing opposed tests with two players standing poised with the thumbs on the books like cowboys at high noon staring each other down.<br/>
<br/>
One of the features of a book as opposed to dice is the ease with which one could influence which pages it would naturally fall open too.  So a game around a "fixing the dice" mechanic could be used with opportunities to bend the book to influence it more towards selecting your victory numbers.  Of course, a game that required you to destroy the book wouldn't be all that marketable.<br/>
<br/>
Now if we move on from numbers all together, the original libromancy technique is to choose a book that you believe contains truth, stand it on its spine, let the book fall open to whatever page it wills, and then with your eyes closed pick a passage of the book with your finger.  Whatever words are there should be read as an indication of your future.  That makes for a rather interesting resolution mechanic when literally any book you have lying about could be used to determine your fate.  <br/>
<br/>
I will ponder further on this.                        </div>

                            here's my aproach. <br/><br/>You have a very simple set of rules (because it is easy to visualize, lets say a combat mechanic, where in i make one roll, if I roll my attack above your defence i hit you for a specific amount of abstract damage.<br/><br/>If on each page of the rules there was a more intricate granular combat manuever (stop thrusts, ripostes, sand-in-the eyes). in a fight you don't have any of these stats you just have a "combat worth" every round you can spend away some of that combat worth to activate a pages rule (i spend 15 points, i can use the rule on page 15). clearly the end of the book rules are way cool (also a good reason to get through the game text)<br/><br/>I don't think this is what shreyas is looking for, but that's what i thought of.                        </div>

                            I almost think you have to include something else in/on the pages. If you use book pages as sequential numbers, then you don't really need to pages. Everyone knows what sequence numbers are in.<br/><br/>Now, say that every time you use a page for resolution, you have to rip that page out of the book, and no-one can use that page number again. Say that this has something to do with Kevin's idea, and once you lose a page you can't use the rules on that page.<br/><br/>Or you could dogear the page over the number, and you can only use that number if you know which number it is. So, each number basically gets 2 free uses (the first when you can see it, and then a second when you can see the number on the facing page), and after that it becomes a memory test.<br/><br/>Or say you take out pages and rearrange them (shuffle them), and then you go from the top down to generate random numbers.                        </div>

                            As I read this thread, I keep thinking "But that doesn't really work if you have a bookmark in place, which is a likely case in an RPG."<br/><br/>It seems that one of the bits that has come up here is taking a weakness with the idea and turning it into a strength.  So, with bookmarks, here's mine:  you have a bookmark in the book, and can even choose its starting place.  Everyone has a book with a bookmark.  When you get into a conflict, you and your opponent (say, you as a PC vs. a GM's NPC) tell each other how many pages back or forward to go from the bookmark.  On that page, there's a number or whatever resolution determiner the game uses.  Example:<br/><br/>PC:  I want to knock the guy out.<br/>GM:  Okay, move three pages back.<br/>PC:  You move five pages forward.<br/>[GM &amp; PC move &amp; look.]<br/>PC: I got a 6.<br/>GM:  I got a 5.  You knock him out.<br/>[Both move the bookmarks to the new locations.]<br/><br/>It doesn't address the original question, but since the thread seems to also be covering alternative ideas, I thought I would toss out what it got me thinking of.                        </div>
