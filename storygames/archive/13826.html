Neither does it fix most problems that your game might have. It is not a replacement for skilled writing, a creative and technical vision, editing, inspiration, or game design work. It is a very specific tool for finding very specific problems, and attempts to use it beyond that are detrimental both to your own game design and to design culture in general.<br/><br/>It is also important when we embark on a playtest that we respect our playtesters' time and attention. Relying on playtest to point out textual, procedural, and mathematical flaws which could be more easily spotted with simple analysis is degrading to our playtesters and also simply bad game design practice. Stop it.</blockquote>\nRead the rest here:<a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=565" rel="nofollow">http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=565</a><br/><br/>How do y'all do playtesting?

I've been lucky enough to mostly playtest with people who (I think) honesty want me to succeed and are willing to go out of their way a little to make that happen.<br><br>Also, if you can, playtest with other game designers. They are very helpful in being able to pick apart why a game did or didn't work.<br><br>Some people really are just better playtesters. I know a few of them, and I think they all share:<br>-The ability to articulate what they're feeling<br>-The interest in gaming to want to try something new<br/>-The flexibility to think about new ideas<br/>-The creativity to see where something could be better<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>So all that is great advice if you happen to be able to find people like that, which I know is kind of a lame point. If you already have those people, you probably don't care. As far as actually running a playtest session:<br/><br/>Don't force it. If people are only playtesting your game to humor you, they're not going to give you good feedback anyway. If you don't think your game is at least at the point that it'll be fun to play, it isn't ready yet.<br/><br/>Don't formalize it too much. Chatting with people is, I've found, way better than having a questionair or something.<br/><br/>Play with people you know, at least at first. This is just controlling the variables: a new game and a new group means more variables when you try to analyze why something did or didn't happen.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I kind of treat a playtest like science. I go into it with a hypothesis about how the game will turn out. I try to limit the number of factors beyond the game that affect the result. Once I feel like I have evidence that my hypothesis happens, I look for peer review and confirmation (outside playtesting).                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks" title="CamBanks"><img alt="CamBanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks">CamBanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313100/#Comment_313100" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-17T16:04:07+00:00" title="February 17, 2011  4:04PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For Smallville, Josh and I wrote up a system reference document with a series of basic mechanical systems, some illustrative characters, and a few other things and began using that for alpha testing. Josh's group as well as a handful of others would try the systems out and give feedback. A great deal of good stuff came out of this period, including the idea of getting rid of Attributes and Skills and instead keeping the Relationships and Values traits as core.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur other designers came on to design and develop additional sections of the game: how Abilities and Distinctions work with each other, the Pathways system of making characters with the charts and collaborations, and so forth. All of it was shared with alphas and then, when we had a stronger scenario, our beta testers. We wanted to see how the rules worked at table, how fans of Classic Cortex reacted to the changes, and how newcomers to Cortex handled it. We collected feedback, digested it, used it to resolve outstanding problems, and helped to create a stronger product.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can redefine some of this as "collaborative design" or you could say it wasn't really playtesting, but to my mind this is exactly what I want out of playtesting groups. Alpha testers who are committed to breaking the game and seeing where it works well and where it doesn't. Beta testers who shake it out in actual play with characters of their own. Testing, testing, testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did this over the span of a few months; Smallville's production cycle was crazy short. But the end result is much stronger as a result, and without any of this, I honestly don't think it'd be anywhere near as good as it is. I don't think this is us lacking in design focus or suffering from bad editing (Amanda's a kick-ass editor and reined in a lot of issues), I think it's a key factor in our overall production success.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/worldnamer" title="worldnamer"><img alt="worldnamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/60/224926835_32ff7cf58d_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/worldnamer">worldnamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313103/#Comment_313103" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-17T16:18:08+00:00" title="February 17, 2011  4:18PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We playtest internally, especially as we're trying to form in our minds what it is we're building. Mostly we just play a session, then after we're done for the evening, we talk about what did or didn't work for us. That works partially because there's enough of us to practically be a gaming group by ourselves. And in some ways, it's essential, because there's three of us writing rules and playtesting is a good way to get us all on the same page.<br><br>So far, our external playtesting has been with me as a GM and people unrelated to the game development as players. Having a second group of people take a look at your work and tell you where they want to go with it really helps at first, because it forces one to get to the point where the idea you want to communicate is well-formed. That's reason enough to pitch it to another group. But it's not like it's a big deal, and the value diminishes over time. <br><br>I think the important thing is that playing the game one's designed changes something from idea to reality. Once something's real, you can see the edges - how it's shaped - and you can make changes if you want it to look differently. But like any aspect of game design, overfocusing is destructive.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313108/#Comment_313108" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-17T17:15:09+00:00" title="February 17, 2011  5:15PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I go to conventions and play with different groups of people.

I've thought a bit about what's made it so effective.<br/><br/>1. Monsterhearts is a hack of Apocalypse World, though pretty wildly divergent (it's about supernatural teen heartbreak drama). But having the core mechanics already in place, and already in players' heads, did a few good things: it gave the game immediate buy-in, it made the first playtests <i>not sucky</i>, and it garnered attention from potential playtesters. You might not <br/><br/>2. Before releasing anything to playtesters, I spent a lot of time immersing myself in my genre. I watched all of True Blood (S1-S3), lots of Buffy (S1-S4ish), Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse, An American Werewolf in London, The Craft, Ginger Snaps, Jennifer's Body, and Cursed. I was also living with my teenage siblings at the time. I kept these inspirations close to my heart. I didn't just ruminate on them: I learned to breathe them, to pump them through my veins, to become them. I made myself into an expert, before I started looking for outside feedback. I made myself as knowledgeable as possible before I asked others to support my endeavors.<br/><br/>2a. In general, I think that's good advice where observable: turn yourself into an expert, before you start requesting the help of others. Otherwise, you're asking others to support your laziness. You're asking others to do the heavy lifting, to be the sources of competence on a project that boasts your name. Not fair. Become the expert.<br/><br/>3. With external playtests, the people who were playtesting the game provided some really awesome bits of feedback: where the rules clashed with their expectations<a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=1008.0" rel="nofollow">(example: feedback on The Infernal's Darkest Self)</a>, where the rules got in the way of their interactions, how the players' relationships affected the characters' relationships<a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=1015.0" rel="nofollow">(example)</a>.<br/><br/>3a. An example: External playtesters noted that the When You Shut Someone Down move was interrupting conversations in a way that was frustrating. They'd have this dysfunctional argument, and it'd be interrupted, and the rules would take it down a less interesting avenue. At first, my reaction was, "Pfft, you're clearly just doing it wrong." But I managed to move past that reaction and actually observe my own table: I was noticing that When You Shut Someone Down was making arguments less interesting and less dynamic. It wasn't about the rules not working, it was about the rules interfacing with the players' imaginations in a frustrating way.<br/><br/>4. There have been a few times when players naturally did something (like, during pre-play, making notes of certain relationships, on the corner of their character sheet), and it felt like the perfect thing to do. In those cases, I've tried to look at their behavior and assess: should that practice/process be a part of the game? Is that something I can codify?<br/><br/>4a. An example from <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=681.0" rel="nofollow">here</a>: Steve said, <i>"Ellen chose to play a Fay, which immediately brought the idea of promises into play. Not only did I write that down, I actually added it to my list of MC moves ('Make a promise to the Fay')."</i> Man, that was a good call, Steve! Can I codify that? Yes! I can add a section to the list of MC moves, with a single move for each of the character Skins. If there's a Witch in play, it opens up a move for the MC. That way, the MC knows how to tug at each type of monster, without having to study them rigorously.<br/><br/>5. When you playtest, watch for: people's reactions to different moves, whether their expectations match what you're delivering to them, whether a given rule makes the situation at hand more interesting or not, whether people are excited about failures or dismayed, which rules and ideas players latch onto.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313161/#Comment_313161" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-18T06:16:09+00:00" title="February 18, 2011  6:16AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, so it seems like everyone supports <i>some </i>type of playtesting at some point in the design process.

This is great.<br/><br/>What I'm hearing is that most folks are using two different stages of playtest:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Internal/Alpha:</strong> The designer(s) play with a core crew while working out the rough edges</li>\n<li><strong>Beta:</strong> The designer(s) play with a new group of folks, perhaps strangers, and note their reactions and use of the rules</li>\n<li><strong>(not always) Gamma:</strong> Total strangers take the text and run with it, reporting back on their experiences</li>\n</ul>\nBoard game folks seem to say that the game hasn't been playtested until it's been played without the designer present.<br/><br/>For one early board game project, I wrote down everyone's move each turn so that I could go back and "see" the game as played at any point to get outside my own perspective a bit. I've read about video game companies recording playtesting sessions to identify player emotional (and mechanical) responses to bits of a game. Both of those seem a bit extreme, and not necessarily productive, for story-games. It sounds like most folks here use something closer to the Narrative inquiry method (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_inquiry" rel="nofollow">wikipedia link</a>). In fact, <br/>Sage (thanks!) you wrote: \n<blockquote>Don't formalize it too much. Chatting with people is, I've found, way better than having a questionair or something.</blockquote>\nCould you elaborate on that? Is it more about the human response to a questionnaire, or is there a particular technique or set of questions you use to draw out more information in the post-game chat?<br/><br/>With the growth of actual play podcasts, has anyone tried recording playtest sessions to pinpoint problem (or glorious) moments? When I tried this, I found myself too self-conscious to play normally because of the mic.<br/><br/>Mcdaldno: You rock. That's great feedback. When you say external playtesters, it sounds like you mean people playing without you present. Is that right? Did you get much of your feedback via the forums to which you linked us?<br/><br/>[Edited: had to give mcdaldno a shout-out. Everyone else who's posted deserves one too.

More importantly you don\u2019t draw conclusions by asking for people\u2019s opinions. Instead you watch how well and how easily people use something. You study and record their actions. Actions speak louder than words!<br/><br/>Specifically you want to measure performance, accuracy, recall, and emotional response. Techniques for gathering data vary from simply taking notes to recording hand or eye movement, using think aloud protocols, and tracking stress levels. Recording the session is recommended so you can have a 3rd party confirm your observations. <br/><br/>Typically once we have something we can test we\u2026<br/><br/>&gt; identify who\u2019s our audience<br/>&gt; determine what we want them to accomplish<br/>&gt; identify specific priority tasks to test<br/>&gt; create natural scenarios encompassing those tasks<br/>&gt; recruit at least 3 uninitiated users<br/>&gt; run people through scenarios<br/>&gt; take caution not to influence people\u2019s action (asking leading questions)<br/>&gt; record data using any of the techniques mentioned above<br/>&gt; create a report identifying problems discovered<br/>&gt; debrief<br/>&gt; decide what to fix<br/>&gt; fix before next round of testing<br/>&gt; test again using different people<br/><br/>If it\u2019s unclear which fixes will work best you can perform A/B or Multivariate testing. For example, with A/B testing, you distribute different versions of a test (including a control test) with a single variable changed to see which change moves you closer to your goals. But for these specific tests to be effective, you need to reach a large enough audience that there is a reasonable chance of detecting meaningful differences between the distributed tests. Difficult for a small game with a limited audience but very useful for websites. <br/><br/>Even with Usability Testing you have to be careful. With such a small sample size the sample group is unlikely to be representative of a larger population. So it\u2019s difficult to draw larger conclusions about the population itself. But these techniques are excellent for quickly identifying problems with what your testing and taking action to fix them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313193/#Comment_313193" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-18T09:46:40+00:00" title="February 18, 2011  9:46AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Finally went back and dug up this article on the playtesting (more or less) of <i>Halo 3</i>, from back in 2007:<br/><a href="http://www.wired.com/gaming/virtualworlds/magazine/15-09/ff_halo" rel="nofollow">Halo 3 Playtesting Article at Wired</a><br/><br/>If you find it interesting we can discuss where it might be relevant and not, but I got a lot of ideas and renewed clarity after peeking at Bungie's process\u2014and this was 2007, I'd been involved in a lot of playtests by that point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313197/#Comment_313197" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-18T10:15:11+00:00" title="February 18, 2011 10:15AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Will Hindmarch</cite>Finally went back and dug up this article on the playtesting (more or less) of<i>Halo 3</i>, from back in 2007:<br/><a href="http://www.wired.com/gaming/virtualworlds/magazine/15-09/ff_halo" rel="nofollow">Halo 3 Playtesting Article at Wired</a><br/></blockquote>\nWe used Microsoft's usability labs for <i>Schizoid</i> and they're the bomb. You sit behind one-way windows and watch people play your game and listen to their brutal honesty and want to tear your eyes out. That said, it's only marginally more useful than just watching newbies play your game and keeping your mouth shut. You can be in the room with them - keeping your mouth shut is the essential part. (Though you can open it again once it's clear they are stuck and you're ready to make a fix.)<br/><br/>In videogames, we call it "Kleenex Testing" - because you use a tester once and throw them away - to differentiate from QA testing, which is about playing the game over and over again to find the bugs. QA testing finds crashes, stop-shipment issues, but is terrible for "make it more fun" - because the QA guys represent the top fraction of a percent of your players, and the improvements they suggest won't matter for 99% of your players.<br/><br/>Kleenex Testing is <i>really unpleasant</i>. Seeing my game fail before my target audience hurts a lot. I'm not good with criticism. But it makes the game better.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: john</cite>Thanks, y'all! This is great.<br/><br/>What I'm hearing is that most folks are using two different stages of playtest:<br/><br/><strong>Internal/Alpha:</strong>The designer(s) play with a core crew while working out the rough edges<br/><strong>Beta:</strong>The designer(s) play with a new group of folks, perhaps strangers, and note their reactions and use of the rules<br/><strong>(not always) Gamma:</strong>Total strangers take the text and run with it, reporting back on their experiences<br/><br/><br/></blockquote>\nKleenex testing is not Beta - because you don't play the game with them. You watch them open the box, read the rules, and try to figure it out by themselves.<br/><br/>Kleenex testing is not Gamma - because you don't just get a report back. You watch them play. (Though maybe a recording of their play, preferably video, would suffice.)<br/><br/>I think In a Wicked Age and Misery Bubblegum, in particular, would have been greatly improved by some Kleenex Testing! From reading old forums on the Forge and here, it sounds like these games came out, people couldn't figure out how to play them, and then a large amount of forum posts and faqs cleared things up, but by then it was too late - a great number of people were already turned off. Maybe an editor could have saved those games without kleenex testing, but kleenex testing would have been a wake-up call.<br/><br/>My personal, biggest problem is I ignore the results of kleenex tests!<br/><br/>With Spider-Man 2, we saw that people were grinding on repetitive tasks to get to the next mission. We recognized it was a problem. But it was the last few days before ship. Pete, the president of Treyarch, wanted us to fix it. I said No - the point of the kleenex testing was to find the "Shelf-Level Events" - the parts of the game that are so frustrating people put the game on the shelf. Only a Shelf-Level Event was worth the risk fixing at that late hour. I was wrong - grinding through boring missions is a shelf-level event for a lot of people. Wish we'd fixed it.<br/><br/>And with Schizoid, I remember vividly when our game went from way too easy to way too hard. We did a kleenex test with a class at UW, and they just sailed through the game - they didn't have to learn the strategy, tactics, or nuance - but they were having a great time, laughing and bubbling over with joy. But we didn't want people to be able to sail through the game in an hour - they'd feel gypped. So we introduced checkpoints and having to complete a certain number of levels before the next checkpoint and our next kleeenex tests - at the Microsoft usability labs - were brutal. But we didn't double back on the difficultly - we gradually dialed back, and never took it far enough.<br/><br/>So, um, don't be like me. Act on feedback - admit that these people have a negative perception of your game and take responsibility for fixing their (obviously wrongheaded) misconceptions.<br/><br/>I think Halo 3 may be the only videogame that has been usability tested too much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/john" title="john"><img alt="john" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/john">john</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313199/#Comment_313199" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-18T10:17:24+00:00" title="February 18, 2011 10:17AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Will and jenskot -- <br/><br/>That's the sort of thing that I think about for playtesting.

I listen to a lot of AP podcasts and I've found them very instructive.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: john</cite>Have you learned any tricks panning for gold in the stream of actual play recordings?</blockquote>\nI don't know if I've learned any tricks, exactly. Tone of voice tells you a lot about player engagement. Confusion over procedures is something that's easily forgotten once the confusion is resolved, so it's easier to pinpoint problem areas in a recording without relying on human recollection. Identifying steps that people skip or forget is useful for figuring out problem areas in your design -- no one is going to report later that they forgot to employ a procedure (because they don't know they're doing it), so a recording is the only way to get that info. You probably want to give yourself a little time and distance from the test before reviewing the recording so you can listen objectively without the subjective experience of the game overwhelming the data. The biggest lesson I've learned is that my subjective memory of the games I've played in is unreliable -- I remembered one playtest as so problematic that I had virtually given up on my game, but when I edited the audio for my podcast I discovered that I was blowing the problems way out of proportion and forgetting about the fun parts of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lin_fusan" title="lin_fusan"><img alt="lin_fusan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lin_fusan">lin_fusan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313207/#Comment_313207" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-18T11:14:52+00:00" title="February 18, 2011 11:14AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was in-charge of recruiting playtesters for a small board game design studio in Berkeley called TableStar Games. Our process was informally divided up as the following (note that this is all from memory, so it is probably unreliable):<br><br>Internal: Rough, cardboard chits and hand-drawn boards. The designer would sit the employees down (other designers, the producer, the owner, and me) and explain the rules (but refrain from the goals) and play about 30 - 60 mins. Afterward there was a discussion about what people liked and didn't like, as well as questions on rules process and edge cases. We tried to have this Internal trials once a week, but an individual designer might take 2-4 weeks to come up with a new iteration.<br><br>This Internal testing was also the approval process. If the Producer or Owner really liked the game, it would go ahead for further iteration. If they didn't like it, it would die there.<br><br>In-house: This was my job. I went to game stores and message boards to recruit playtesters. This was rather difficult since, unlike video game testing, you have to gather three to six people all the same time to sit down and devote three to four hours trying a game that was "not complete". (For us, this was technically not true. Every game we were testing was playable out of the box. I should never have to walk into a testing situation knowing that something was broken.) Since I'm teaching them, we are not, at this moment, testing the rules text or the writing or whatnot. We are looking for player behavior (what slows people down, what do they think is "fun", etc) at this moment. On more complicated games, we are looking for optimal player strategies too.<br><br>I'm watching people, taking notes on the questions they ask, and answering questions because at this point, we're not testing their understanding of the non-existent rules text. <br/><br/>We had questionnaires for the playtesters to get their initial impressions, but then a conversation afterward to see what they think as a group.<br/><br/>I would explain the game to the playtesters, and then they would play. (On the rare occasion, perhaps due to lack of numbers, I would play also. I tried to avoid this as much as possible. <br/><br/>Out-of-house/beta/black box: This is where we create an accurate mockup of the game with as many shiny bits as possible, ship it with rules text and some basic instructions and questionnaires, and ask teams to play the game as is. Now we are listening to feedback about the rules text and seeing how teams "patch" rules. Now we are focused on "fun" and player comprehension/understanding, and the marketing-speak of "pop" and "flow". <br/><br/>I'm not there, and we are dependent on a volunteer to organize, coordinate, and run a session (with instructions not to play unless absolutely necessary).<br/><br/>For me, the comments from the In-house testing was the hardest to parse. Players are trying to process new information and trying to give criticism. if they are running on an emotional level (and most are), they will cite confusion because the rules are new. So I have to thin-slice that info; are they confused because the rules are confusing, the "flow" is confusing, I'm not explaining the game well, or because they are just overloaded with new info?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313286/#Comment_313286" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-18T18:13:19+00:00" title="February 18, 2011  6:13PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 18, 2011 6:23PM by jenskot.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: john</cite>Will and jenskot --<br/><br/>That's the sort of thing that I think about for playtesting. I'm not sure how to apply those techniques at a smaller scale (and budget). I would love to discuss it further.</blockquote>\nThis is how I would do it\u2026<br/><br/><b>Answer these questions\u2026</b><br/><br/>1.\tWhat is your game? What problem does it solve? What makes it unique?<br/>2.\tWho is your game for? <br/><br/>Without the above, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re playtesting. You don\u2019t know who should playtest your game. Additionally, you won\u2019t know which playtest information to take seriously and what to ignore. And finally, you won\u2019t know if you even need to playtest. <br/><br/><b>Why are these answers important? </b><br/><br/>- If you don\u2019t know what your game does and doesn\u2019t do, how do you know what feedback to listen to? You can\u2019t succeed, if you don\u2019t have goals. You won\u2019t know what direction to walk unless you know where you\u2019re headed. You won\u2019t know when to stop unless you know what your final destination looks like.<br/><br/>- If your game is just for your personal gaming group, why bother with outside playtesting?<br/><br/>- If your game is just for you, why does it matter what anyone else thinks?<br/><br/>- If strategy and tactics are important to your game, why send a playtest copy to freeform gamers?<br/><br/>- If you don\u2019t know what problem your games solves, how do you know what rules to write?<br/><br/><b>You can\u2019t please everyone! </b><br/><br/>Ultimately, no matter what you do, thousands maybe millions of people will disagree with you. You can\u2019t please everyone. Fortunately, if you know who you are trying to please\u2026 you don\u2019t have to care what everyone thinks. If you reached 1% of people currently playing D&amp;D\u2026 that\u2019s 60,000 people. A lot of design, not just game design, is about focus and eliminating anything that distracts from that focus. With focus, you know who and who not to listen to. <br/><br/>Once you identify what problem your game solves, you can nail down whose problem you\u2019re solving. This is your audience. This is who you want playtesting your game.<br/><br/><b>I can\u2019t find playtesters! </b><br/><br/>If you can\u2019t find anyone to playtest your game, that might be a warning sign to go back and revise what problem your game solves and for who. If people don\u2019t want to playtest, maybe it\u2019s because your game doesn\u2019t actually solve a problem they have. Or you\u2019ve misidentified your audience and are talking to the wrong people. Or your audience is very busy and needs fair compensation to make playtesting worth their time. If you can\u2019t compensate them, maybe the project is too small to warrant all the time, energy, and resources dedicated to it as a commercial project and would be better off released non-commercially. <br/><br/>Every roadblock you hit is a sign that you may need to rethink your strategy. It\u2019s a gift. It will force you to step back, sharpen your focus, and ultimately learn from your experience to make you even stronger. <br/><br/><b>Even if you find playtesters, be realistic about your expectations\u2026</b><br/><br/>Sometimes people volunteer to playtest and never come through. If 1 person out of 3 who volunteer actually deliver\u2026 I would consider that a success! If you need 6 playtesters, find 18. <br/><br/><b>Create your playtest\u2026</b><br/><br/>Decide what you need playtested. Think small. Start with the absolute bare minimum rules your game needs to achieve its goals. Identify the top 1-3 things you need tested. Ignore everything else. Create scenarios that will allow playtesters to focus and test these top priorities. <br/><br/>Design your scenarios so what you\u2019re testing isn\u2019t obvious to the playtesters. Your scenario might be, \u201ccreate a character\u201d but what you\u2019re specifically testing is \u201chow long does it take\u201d, \u201cis stat allocation frustrating\u201d, \u201cdoes character creation give the GM enough information to design an adventure.\u201d Don\u2019t tell your playtesters what you are actually playtesting. <br/><br/>Take caution that your scenario doesn\u2019t influence your playtesters actions. Don\u2019t ask leading questions or make leading statements. If you want to test \u201chow long does this take\u201d, in your scenario, don\u2019t say \u201ccharacter creation is super fast\u201d. Don\u2019t influence! <br/><br/>Run through your scenario before you give it to playtesters. Make sure it\u2019s clear and error free, otherwise you tests may fail for reasons unrelated to your game. Check your grammar, make sure any jargon is clearly defined, give clarifying examples, and cut out anything that isn\u2019t related to your test that could distract from your goals.<br/><br/><b>Running playtests\u2026</b><br/><br/>Make sure your audience is uninitiated. Don\u2019t test the same scenarios with the same people. Ideally, don\u2019t run multiple tests with the same people at all. And run each test with 3 separate groups of testers.<br/><br/>Record all your tests. It may not be possible for you to be present for all your tests. And even if you are, in the moment you may miss something. <br/><br/>Ideally your scenarios are prepared so playtesters can run through them without your involvement. Your goal is to observe and not interfere. If your rules are in the pre-alpha state (more ideas than solid procedures), feel free to guide the playtesters through your scenarios but recruit a third party to observe the test or absolutely make sure to record the test so you can make observations later. Don\u2019t multitask. <br/><br/>Train your playtesters to think out loud. If you\u2019re recording audio, you\u2019ll miss all their revealing facial expressions. Talk to them, make them feel comfortable, run through practice scenarios first (not your actual real scenarios) so people get used to thinking out loud. If people are quiet, ask them what they are thinking. If people talk out loud, nod along and give them encouragement. Reassure them that the playtest is a safe space, they can say anything, just be honest. Make sure they know that they aren\u2019t being judged. I know this will sound funny\u2026 but it\u2019s probably best not to tell them you\u2019re the game designer! That alone will bias the test.<br/><br/>If you\u2019re taking notes while people playtest, do so in a way that people can\u2019t see you. <br/><br/>Don\u2019t ask playtesters for their opinions. Especially after the test is over. People are unreliable self-reporters. Plus their job is to playtest, not observe themselves playtesting or trying to fix your problems. Your goal is to make observations by studying what people do, not what they say they did. In playtesting, actions speak louder than words! <br/><br/><b>Creating reports, identifying problems, solutions, and more tests!</b><br/><br/>Review your recordings and notes to create a report identifying all the problems (even if you don\u2019t think they are actual problems). Take special note of any problems or unusual behavior that happen more than once. <br/><br/>If you can, get a second person to create a report by reviewing the recordings and identifying the problems independently of your observations. Compare the two reports.<br/><br/>Compare these problems to your goals. <br/><br/>Decide which problems actually need to be solved.<br/><br/>Fix these problems.<br/><br/>Create new scenarios to confirm your fixes work.<br/><br/>Run additional playtests with new people.<br/><br/><b>Playtesting your text is more important than playtesting your rules!</b><br/><br/>When someone buys your game\u2026 all your rules become guidelines to be followed or discarded at the whim of your audience! <br/><br/>And even if they decide to follow your guidelines, the rules don\u2019t matter unless they understand what the rules are, how to use them, why they are important, when to use them, what will happen if you don\u2019t use them\u2026 and then actually remember all this when it is time to play! <br/><br/>This is where your game text comes in and why playtesting text is more important than playtesting rules. Your rules have no power at anyone\u2019s gaming table. You must persuade players to use them (this is true even in boardgames). Your text is your only tool of persuasion. Use it wisely! <br/><br/>Your text needs to do more than teach. Your text needs to turn its advocates into teachers to spread its message. Your text has to arm its readers with the tools to teach other people who will never bother to read your text! This is where handouts, character sheets, and reference sheets all come in. They not only help people who haven\u2019t read the rules to learn\u2026 but also remind everyone what the rules are, when, and how to use them. <br/><br/><b>I don\u2019t know how to write my rules\u2026</b><br/><br/>But you probably know how to verbally teach others how to play them. So do that and record yourself. Then listen to the recording and create an outline. What order did you explain things? What questions did people ask? What rules needed extra explanation? What examples really helped people understand how to play? What confused people? <br/><br/>And then do it again but this time, as scary as it might sound, video tape yourself doing it! Why? Because when you\u2019re teaching people how to play, you\u2019re probably using body language and visual cues (pointing to specific rule pages, charts, character sheets, rolling dice) to help people understand what you\u2019re talking about. And your text can do the same thing with the help of images. <br/><br/>And hire an editor!<br/><br/><b>Editing isn\u2019t just fixing grammar and spelling mistakes! </b><br/><br/>Editing is also about content. What\u2019s the best way to express an idea? What order is the clearest and most effective way to express your ideas? Which ideas need to be reinforced with examples? Which ideas aren\u2019t important and need to be cut out? <br/><br/><b>Editing is not enough!</b><br/><br/>You need to playtest your editing just like you would playtest any rule changes. Grab someone and watch them read your rules out loud. If its\u2019 painful, don\u2019t turn away\u2026 find out why it hurts and fix it.<br/><br/><b>If I do all this, will my game sell? </b><br/><br/>Does a contract protect your rights? Not absolutely. My friend Chris who\u2019s an IP lawyer once described contracts as a +2 circumstance bonus in a d20 law roll. Nothing is guaranteed but just like in D&amp;D when you\u2019re facing a red dragon, you\u2019re going to want every bonus you can get! You might attack unprepared and get lucky rolling a natural 20! Or watch in despair when that die reveals that cruel critical miss\u2026 a natural 1! But the game isn\u2019t about just 1 roll. It\u2019s about trying again and again. Learning from mistakes. And arming yourself as best you can.<br/><br/><b>I hope that helps! </b><br/><br/>It all sounds harder than it actually is. And even if you can only do 25% of the above\u2026 you\u2019re ahead of most game designers! Hell, if you just clearly know what problem your game solves and who your audience is\u2026 that alone puts you way ahead. Focus on doing what you can. Be honest with yourself. Remember that getting started is the hardest part. And doing the first 10% is the first step in doing the next 10%. <br/><br/>Rock,<br/>John                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313310/#Comment_313310" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-18T21:13:40+00:00" title="February 18, 2011  9:13PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, that is great, great stuff.

Since I'm relying on volunteers to playtest my game <i>at all</i>, I feel really awkward asking them to change their behavior once they are engaged in the process, so usually I just quietly seethe when they do things suboptimally. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Here are the biggest things I think people need to learn to become good playtesters: 1) It's human nature to want to hear the designer say "I will change my game to accommodate your feedback", but a good playtester should only be shooting for "I heard and understood the feedback you were giving me". 2) Don't harp on things. Once an issue has been noted, move past it and try to get to the next issue. Hammering relentlessly on a single problem doesn't do anyone any good. It takes skill to look beyond issues, but in a medium like RPGs where running a single test takes so much time and energy and the cycle time on revising a game is so long it's a good idea to try to get as much as you can from a single test -- for example, if your bitching about problems in chargen is interfering with effective observation of what is or isn't working in the resolution mechanics then you're doing it wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/john" title="john"><img alt="john" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/john">john</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313532/#Comment_313532" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-21T11:56:22+00:00" title="February 21, 2011 11:56AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dan: I see you do playtesting via Skype, and are a participant.

I don't have local friends that are interested in playing story games so I have turned to Skype for my gaming (I just do audio, not video). My playtesting has just been an extension of that. You need a certain number of people to be involved to have critical mass for a game session. My theory is that it's easier to find a group of people willing to do that if you cast a net over the entire planet rather than restricting your search to your immediate local area, but there is a bit of an anti-Skype-gaming stigma in this community so my approach isn't as effective as I might hope. Over on Praxis I pitched the idea of several designers getting together to form a group to playtest each others' games and several people took me up on the offer, and those sessions are the ones I've been putting out as the past few episodes of my podcast. Up until recently I hadn't been confident that my rules were solid enough to warrant playtesting without my participation, but my last round of playtests convinced me the game was solid enough to move from internal testing to external, so I've been <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/2011/01/10/playtesters-needed-for-storied-age/" rel="nofollow">soliciting people to play the game</a> without my involvement (hopefully recording the sessions and sending the results to me, but beggars can't be choosers).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
