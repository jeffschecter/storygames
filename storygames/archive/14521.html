I would especially like to hear from people of color, but don't feel like you have to post (obviously). <b>White people, don't answer yet, please - </b>I'd love to hear from you, too, later, but don't want this thread to be overrun by "us". If this thread dies because nobody feels like answering, that's OK, too. <br/><br/>I'm from one of those Viking countries - Norway, in my case. I've laughed at the responses to Idris Elba playing Heimdall in "Thor" (I think it's a cool thing, and funny because it's unexpected, and I love it, even though I don't care about the movie). I've designed a Viking scenario for use in schools, and made a point out of incorporating people of color &amp; women as main protagonist characters.<br/><br/>Now, let's not discuss historical settings - let's talk about <b>fantasy </b>vikings. If you're playing a game where (for instance) characters have fake-sounding Nordic names, horns on their helmets, keep going berserk all the time, and have a bunch of generic fantasy spells with Viking-ish names tacked on - you're not really going for historical correctness. What would you think of playing a dark-skinned character in such a game? Or meeting dark-skinned NPCs? Would it need a justification, or could it be presented with no further comment?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330707/#Comment_330707" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-19T04:03:39+00:00" title="June 19, 2011  4:03AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dumbass tokenism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330785/#Comment_330785" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-19T22:42:11+00:00" title="June 19, 2011 10:42PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Someone asked about my skin color in a whisper.

Some African guy is pretty unlikely to simply be there 'with no further comment'. I don't see no black people in <i>Beowulf</i>.<br/><br/>What we're dealing with here are the insecurities of, essentially, American culture. For example, that's why we're casting these things largely in terms of black-white. That's why it's seen as desirable to throw a black actor into a quintessentially white setting, just to have a symbolic representation of part of the population. Let's turn that around and imagine a film about a tribe of Zulu who <i>just happen</i> to have a white guy amidst them, completely unexplained and uncommented on. WTF?<br/><br/>We could instead be seeing films, or playing games, that tell the stories of black people (or Asian people, or Aboriginal people, or...), if in fact we wanted to see and hear more about them. We do not, and thus the existence of black faces in white films is in fact <i>predicated on</i> racism and white privilege.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AusJeb" title="AusJeb"><img alt="AusJeb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AusJeb">AusJeb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330803/#Comment_330803" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-20T06:24:08+00:00" title="June 20, 2011  6:24AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Vikings mean sea raiders and traders. <br/><br/>Actually, it is a very good question why the Swahili or others in East Africa didn't have a larger role in the Indian Ocean trade over the last 3,000 years.

I'm curious to speak with her and see what she has to say about the issue.

I guess it walks the line, and unless there's no logical explanation as to why this or that Viking is so dark, it's uninteresting. On the other hand, blond haired blue eyed children could be slaves in the US. Blackness was defined by parentage, not skin color. The lightness and darkness of one's skin certainly had social advantages and disadvantages, and I could imagine that the difference in skin color of a dark skinned Viking would have advantages and disadvantages.<br/><br/>What would be really awesome is if a fantasy Viking game didn't pander to the colorstruck, but used a character's place or circumstances of birth in an interesting, accessible way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331002/#Comment_331002" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-21T11:22:33+00:00" title="June 21, 2011 11:22AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Verisimilitude trumps just about everything else.

The vikings were slavers.  Many of the slaves they took were black.  While not numerous, its quite likely that (depending on the time period in question) most vikings had at least seen a black man in Scandinavia, Britain, or Ireland (Ireland especially was a cornerstone of the slave trade).<br/><br/>The ancient world was far more ethnically mixed than most modern folks realize.  There was an entire district of Chinese in the city of Cairo.  Phoenician ships regularly traveled to Britain for tin.  The Gauls raided all the way through Greece and settled in central Anatolia.  Indo Iranian people reached all the way to Ireland (The Eire of Ire-land is the same root as the Eire of Ir-an).  Goths wound up in Spain and North Africa.  Normans wound up in Sicily and Italy.  Merchants from as far away as East Africa, India, and Indonesia crossed by sea to the Persian Gulf, up the Tigris, and across to the Greek cities of the Decapolis.  Those guys traveled.  Whether as merchants (logging many thousands of miles), raiders (logging many thousands of miles), missionaries (logging many thousands of miles), or captives...you could pretty much make a case for finding just about any ethnicity anywhere and it wouldn't be that much of a stretch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331049/#Comment_331049" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-21T15:50:21+00:00" title="June 21, 2011  3:50PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, yes, I know all that, but Matthijs is asking about something different.

They're not about historical people, they're about "us".<br/><br/>Who counts as "us" is, of course, a vexed question, but to my mind, fantasies about a whites-only "us" are fantasies of white supremacy, of the erasure of non-white people.<br/><br/>So I'd be cool with black vikings. The vikings are, after all, a stand-in for our own society, which is multi-ethnic. How you present that of course is more complex. "Mixed in without comment" seems like the least interesting approach. I'd like to see the black vikings as a distinct clan or moiety, but that would be difficult to do well. What "blackness" signifies on TV shows is pretty problematic, so it would be hard to make a setting in which blackness pointed to a distinct ethnic identity, without that identity being a stereotype.<br/><br/>Jeff raises a good point though, about why we tend to go to a faux-historical Europe for our fantasy milieu, and not a faux-historical Africa or China or whatever. I guess it's about the way that the dominant culture's traits are "normalised" such that we don't see them. We can project what we like onto fantasy vikings, because they're "us".

In other words, just because we don't have to abide by historical realism doesn't mean we can bust out the racist stereotypes, or erase non-whites from our stories.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331096/#Comment_331096" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-21T21:06:28+00:00" title="June 21, 2011  9:06PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: droog</cite><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>What do you think?</blockquote>\nI think you should play it and see.<br/><br/>Good call!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331101/#Comment_331101" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-21T21:45:13+00:00" title="June 21, 2011  9:45PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "turning black people into cool objects."<br/><br/>Ah, see, that was my thought. <br/>I think putting lots of different ethnic groups next to each other in a city or something, and giving them <i>reasons</i> to be there, is interesting. But a lot of American movies are engaging in Orientalism a fair bit of the time. Or, you know, all the time. <br/><br/>I actually had a situation a bit like that, once, and it brought out some interesting stuff in the game group. <br/>We were making characters for Freemarket, and I had an image in my head of a little Arab girl with a hijab. I explained it to the other players, and they said, "Okay, what were you going to do with her as your character?" I couldn't think of anything. I eventually scrapped the idea in favor of creating an 8-year old Buddhist nun. <br/><br/>When they asked why I chose that as a replacement, I said, "I'm interested in cross-gender play and I'm a Buddhist." There was an element of seeking approval in how I chose to make the change, but it occurred to me that it was kind of hollow (and, potentially, weird and racist in play) for me to be fixated on playing the little Arab Muslim girl. <br/><br/>Come to think of it, what if I had been obsessed with playing Kareem Abdul Jabbar, circa Enter the Dragon? Total pre-blaxploitation stuff, right? What is happening at the table when someone who looks like me acts that out? \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>To talk about historical accuracy in fantasy is to miss the point.

It can also be an attempt at understanding someone else, even just a little. When I played a Vietnamese woman in 60's America, I spent some time doing research, trying to get into her mindset. It was interesting. Of course, she was just a fictional character, but I learned a little from it. <br/><br/>If I played a little Arab Muslim girl, I might learn something from that, too.

Just one or a very few black viking would have a tiresome whiff of tokenism (as droog says), but if you put in a nice hodgepodge of physical types all running around brandishing their axes, fine.<br/><br/>(Pseudo-)historically, I guess you could base something on Ibn Fadhlan to get an arab or moor, but other than that, whiff of tokenism. However if you want to play with ethnicities, there's plenty of interesting stuff in RL norse history. Lapps and Finns vs. Norse, Slavs and Balts vs. Norse, Inuit vs. Norse, Irish/British/Celts vs. Norse (&amp; germans, french, whatever). Of course none of those are actually dark-skinned, but those have interesting stuff to play with.<br/><br/>As regards whether we're playing with old stuff or it's really just us in disguise, I'd say both, ideally, if we're doing historical stuff. Hitting McDragon for a burger in your "historical" game gets old pretty quickly, and not a historical sort of old. Doing detailed and tortuously faithful historical simulations also get rather old. Historical gaming has two things going for it, as I see it:<br/><br/>1) Plundering history for cool stuff. Seriously, there's a world of awesome exotic stuff, plots, gimmicks, macguffins and whatnot, ripe for the taking.<br/><br/>2) Using the ways in which people and customs were different to reflect upon how they are now.

I wanna hear more about this.<br/><br/>Example: Lots of our (western/european) concepts of honour, revenge and forgiveness have historical roots. We're now at a considerable remove from those roots. A game of, say conflict between the demands of honour and the need to make peace, set in the old, bloody version of it without much of a state to put up guarantees of either justice or peace make both peace (how about not having everyone you love wiped out by the ensuing blood feud?) and honour (how about doing something about it when your asshole neighbour steals your horse and murders your brother?) intensely personal things. Which can make for kick-ass gaming.<br/><br/>Also, point of arbitrary black viking interest: Back in the day, the Irish called the Norwegians "White Danes" and the Danish "Black Danes".
