I'm looking for ideas for how to write up instructions and play tips for something a bit peculiar, as noted in the title.<br/><br/>Basically, the concept is that some players in a game format with many players (think parlor larp with maybe two dozen people) are going to take on what are normally NPC villain type roles in a tabletop game.<br/><br/>For genre emulation reasons, it isn't desirable for these characters to ultimately "win" the scenario ( although minor victories along the way are desirable, and possibly consolation prize type victories at the end of the scenario. )<br/><br/>What kinds of instructions can I give those players that get this across?<br/>What kinds of fun is there for these players?<br/>What kinds of tips can I give them for playing those characters?<br/><br/>Since these players are basically NPCs, can or should I also give them some GM type player level mechanics they can employ, and of what sort?<br/><br/>A recognition ceremony for the villain players?<br/>I'm thinking about this as part of the scenario session wrap up. While their characters ( for genre emulation reasons) cannot win in-fiction, I feel there should be some kind of award or recognition for these players. What sorts of categories of recognition and for what sort of behavior or activities in-game?<br/><br/>I realize there are all kinds of potential scenarios, so I'll give you something to work with.<br/><br/>Imagine some sort of adventure fiction. Let's just use the Star Wars universe, since those movies are fairly well known. The setting is some sort of planet on the frontier, Rebellion Era, and the players I'm talking about will run characters like various Empire officers, gangsters/pirates, and so on.<br/><br/>What do I tell those folks? I need something I can print up that they can refer to even when I'm not personally there, as we'll assume actual play time is at a premium ( say a gaming convention time slot.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426424/#Comment_426424" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-01T10:51:13+00:00" title="January  1, 2014 10:51AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob, I think this is easier than you think.

I'd give very different advice for playing those as opposed to, say, the Emperor.  With a main villain, players may have opportunities to develop them, add nuance, and gain some audience investment in the villain's endeavors and fate.  With a token imperial officer, on the other hand, all the player can really hope to do is add some amusing color to their role as prop or plot device for the protagonists.<br/><br/>With real characters, I might tell the players something like, "Your goal before you lose is to make everyone else truly fear what would happen if you succeeded.  When you die or are defeated, everyone should say, 'Whew! Thank god!'"<br/><br/>With prop characters, I might tell the players something like, "Your goal is to come up with a unique and entertaining schtick -- accent, tic, way of speaking, prevailing emotion or disposition -- that you can grab some spotlight with during your few moments on screen."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/arscott" title="arscott"><img alt="arscott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/arscott">arscott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426449/#Comment_426449" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-02T00:23:44+00:00" title="January  2, 2014 12:23AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is there something about the characters and the situation that would make it really easy for the villains to win if they tried?

This is achievable whether or not the villain succeeds -- and it adds obvious pathos to the villain's inevitable failure, and complicates the protagonists' success in interesting ways.<br/><br/>Depending on how your game is set up, you might provide more specific goals, like 'die with This Important Item clutched in your hands' or 'do at least one major wound to Protagonist X, your rival' or whatever. <br/><br/>You can also do fun things with goal scope, like for example making all of the Protagonist goals external and concrete, while the villains have exclusively emotional or interpersonal goals. But I'd say the default is to have the scope of the villains' goals match up with the scope of the protagonists'. So however specific you're being about guiding the protagonists, that's how specific to be for the villains.<br/><br/>Other classic self-conscious villain goals (some of these would be purely player-level goals, unless the villain is extremely meta) could include: <br/><br/>* bring out the best in someone else<br/>* convince protag X to betray protag Y<br/>* explain your secret plot to at least five people<br/>* tie somebody to the railroad tracks  (or otherwise place them in indirect peril)<br/>* never tell the truth; bonus points for every person that notices<br/>* seize The MacGuffin at all costs -- it is crucial for your plan! (it's not, actually)<br/><br/>I mean, the list goes on, and ultimately it depends heavily on the scenario you are creating, and to what degree you intend to steer events or possible events.<br/><br/>Another possibility, similar to giving the villains primarily emotional goals, is to give villains all of the Bangs -- each villain has goals which involve making specific offers or revealing specific secrets about various protagonists, or otherwise forcing an open-ended decision point. 'You know who really killed the butler -- tell somebody at an unexpected moment, bonus points if they act rashly as a result.' Etc. As the scenario designer you will presumably have a bunch of these mini-situations and dilemmas in mind already, so distribute them to the villain PCs in a way that makes sense.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426511/#Comment_426511" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-02T22:49:37+00:00" title="January  2, 2014 10:49PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Check out <a href="http://wonderlarps.com/wreckers/question.html" rel="nofollow">wonderlarps.com/wreckers/question.html</a> for a questionnaire I filled out recently.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Crunch" title="Crunch"><img alt="Crunch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Crunch">Crunch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426525/#Comment_426525" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-03T07:21:58+00:00" title="January  3, 2014  7:21AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Oh, yeah, some sort of measurable victory condition would be great, if the system could support such things!

Again, casting questionnaires help. There aren't guarantees, but some GMs get quite good at this, especially when they know the player base. Fr'ex, when we ran larps at Columbia University, there was a couple who would find some in-character excuse to kiss. Okay, we can work with this -- give them the appropriate PCs. There were some who would exploit every power we gave them. Okay -- be very clear about the limits of such powers, and don't give them PCs doomed to lose. There were some who were very clear about not wanting to lose. Okay, this is useful -- we'll cast accordingly.<br/><br/>Yes, if players cheat, you're fucked. But, for honest players with limits, you can work with that. The tricky parts:<br/><br/>-- Players who don't know themselves as well as they think they do<br/>-- Miscasting due to honest information that's just not as helpful as it seemed<br/><br/>But, communicate as well as you can. Fr'ex, in a Broadway Musical Mash-Up larp, I got a look at someone else's character sheet after the game. It read like this:<br/><br/>Goal 1: Blahblah. You will fail at this. You have to try anyway.<br/>Goal 2: Blahblahblah. You're probably going to fail at this one too.<br/><br/>There were a couple of actually achievable goals -- but the goals weren't as much the point for this character in this larp. Scenery chewing and running about trying to keep a lid on chaos and failing were.<br/><br/>Another guy played a couple of different characters, as one of them was the dentist from Little Shop of Horrors, and he knew full well where that plot line was going. Again, the questionnaire asked "How do you feel about playing a doomed character?" and "How do you feel about playing a series of different characters?"<br/><br/>And, if things go wrong, don't beat yourself up. As Straightjackets Optional's Fearless Team Leader once said, all larps are failures, in a way. The key is to learn from each, to fail better, and to give everyone -- including yourself -- a good time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426597/#Comment_426597" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-04T08:57:57+00:00" title="January  4, 2014  8:57AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great info.
