I've got some free time and a desire to try to expand the universe of people I've gamed with, so I'm going to try to kill two birds with one stone: Would anyone out there like to playtest some RPGs over Skype with me? It only takes a handful of people getting their schedules lined up to form critical mass for a game. Some people are understandably nervous about gaming with people they haven't met before, or gaming over Skype if they haven't done it before, but I'd encourage people to think of this like a convention game: there's no need for long-term commitments, but it's an opportunity to try a new game and build contacts with people you might like to game with again.<br/><br/>Here are the constraints I'm working with:<br/>I live in the US Pacific time zone, but my schedule is pretty flexible. I have regular commitments every Monday and Thursday night, but I can make a lot of other times work.<br/>I find that three hour sessions over Skype tend to be the best.<br/>There are plenty of games that work fine with just Skype and Googledocs, so I don't like to bother with any virtual tabletops. For games that use dice, we can just read our results off to each other (I personally like the tactile experience of rolling real dice in games that use them).<br/>I'm planning to record the sessions so I can make the audio available to the designer, since it's potentially very useful playtest info.<br/>I'd like to have the option of <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/podcast/" rel="nofollow">podcasting</a> the session, but won't do it if any participants are uncomfortable with the idea.<br/><br/>If this sounds like something you'd like to try, let me know (either with a public reply, a whisper, or e-mail to dan.maruschak at gmail.com), and let me know what kind of schedule availability you have (please be specific) so I can try to get a session organized. I'm assuming that I'll take the GM or facilitator role, but if someone else has a game they want to run I'd be open to considering it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324995/#Comment_324995" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-17T16:35:35+00:00" title="May 17, 2011  4:35PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 17, 2011 4:36PM by stefoid.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great idea.

Thanks to all of you for taking the game out for a spin - this was actually super useful for me. Having three people who've never played together before sitting down with the text and trying to play it cold, with no input or interaction with the designer is great for finding all the places where things are broken. I've already given the recording of the session a listen through once, and I'll be sitting down shortly to go through and take more notes to incorporate into the next draft of the game.
