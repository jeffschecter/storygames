And think of how insanely specific the setting for PARANOIA is!)  Paul specifically wanted to create a new setting that fostered long-term play and developed the Degringolade, the minotaurs, Silence and everything else to do that.<br/><br/>I made the Golem connection too, Potemkin!  I can assure you that the setting will not thwart you, it's designed to do the opposite.  Paul was tapping into his old school roots when he designed The Clay That Woke.  There are tons of old games that have brilliant, beautiful settings that make you want to play... and then the rules suck and don't give you the ability to engage with that setting in the way that inspired you.  The Clay setting is intended to inspire you and the mechanics are designed to support your engagement with it in play.  The entire game is built with that intent in mind.  So what he's saying is that the games that inspired him to make clay thwarted <i>him</i>, and he's designing in response to that.<br/><br/>I'm going to come back in a little bit and write about what minotaurs actually get up to, but I wanted to get this part posted first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429167/#Comment_429167" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-06T09:42:35+00:00" title="March  6, 2014  9:42AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 6, 2014 9:43AM by Marhault.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Can you tell me more about surreal jungle life and what Minotaurs actually get up to?

I mean, okay, it's probably best to not just go around killing folks, I'll give you that!<br/><br/>There are two locales in the game.  The first is the Degringolade, which is an enormous, crumbling city grown in and ingrown by the surrounding jungle.  In the Degringolade, yes, the minotaurs are subjugated and work menial, shitty jobs.  They're newcomers to human society (only a few generations since they arrived) and their greater physicality and ability to withstand hardship is being taken advantage of by that society.  So what do you do when you find yourself playing a character in that kind of circumstance?  This game isn't about taking shit from your human "masters", it's about finding ways to change a society for the better from within.<br/><br/>Just as important is the jungle, which surrounds and encroaches on the Degringolade.  In the jungle, you'll face fantastic monsters and mad Voices (the Voices are not gods, and <i>do not</i> let them tell you differently).  This is more classical "adventuring" is done in Clay.  Minotaurs who go frantic from breaking Silence (you can go voluntarily too) will find themselves in the jungle, having to deal with strange circumstances in order to refocus themselves before they return to the city.  For the minotaurs of the Degringolade, the jungle and the city are linked; they gain consequence and experience there that will allow them to be more than the cleaners of stables and subjugated underclass that they begin the game as.<br/><br/>I'm not sure that answers your question.

Let me just express a tiiiny misgiving that I'm having (although it's probably a misunderstanding on my part, seeing as I have no idea what "<b><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">S</span></i></b>ilence" is): So, you're a Minotaur (are they called that in-game? The Island of Minos is kinda far from any jungles...), you have quiet little chats with other Minotaurs about how terribly tragic your underclass lives are and then generally get worked up about living conditions until you break your caste's Silence tenement and have to go on a mystic journey to face the dangers out there in Jamanji-country to... attone(?) for your sins before returning to the city (manful adventures and enlightenment being found en route)?  I like the concept but I'm picturing there being a heavy-handed points system that's forever forcing you in and out of the city. Too many "rage" points? Looks like you're off for some time-out in the Jungle, guy. ...maybe I'm worried that breaking Silence and having to go on your bull-man pilgrimage will be too artificially enforced? <br/><br/>I'm super interested in how this'll work out. I'm totally into the powerful-but-outcast vibe - I'm writing something similar about Irish giants resisting Oliver Cromwell, so, youknow, similar.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429172/#Comment_429172" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-06T11:31:29+00:00" title="March  6, 2014 11:31AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>We know the first four minotaurs appeared on the riverbank, but where have all the others come from?

First: my favorites, for Jason.<br/><br/>Mechanically, my favorite thing is the Krater of Lots resolution mechanic.  When certain circumstances occur (dangerous situations, the presence of the supernatural, etc.) the GM calls for a draw from the Krater.  Both the GM and the minotaur player add tokens from their supply to a bowl (or a bag, let's be honest) based on the circumstances and what the desired outcome is.  The Krater's outcomes are NOT success/failure, they're much more interesting.  "Your efforts change the mind of the opposition", for example.  Clearly that indicates a success in some conflicts/circumstances, but it also indicates what type of success AND there are situations where it may not be success at all.  The outcomes also change your token supplies and affect other mechanical elements of the game.<br/><br/>My favorite part of the setting.  Ooooh man.  <i>The Voices.</i>  They're a trio of insanely powerful, disembodied entities that exist in the jungle.  The Voices seem to be interested in the lives of minotaurs (or perhaps minotaurs are their pawns to influence the future of the Degringolade?) but they're unknowable and, well... crazy.  The voices may come to you in the jungle, they may give you supernatural gifts of great power, they may use you to their own ends.  They may get you killed.  The very best part is that, by their very presence, they necessitate a Krater draw; and they're unique and important enough that each has its own special token to put in the Krater when it is present.  I always wanted to do a D&amp;D campaign where the gods were directly involved with the affairs of the world and the adventurers.  Clay does that out of the box.<br/><br/>Epengar, since those first four minotaurs appeared on the riverbank, the minotaurs have integrated into Degringolade society.  There are no female minotaurs.  All minotaurs are the offspring of a male minotaur and a human woman.  The minotaurs now make up a substantial but small minority of the population a few generations on.  Are you thinking about how that interbreeding must create conflict and tensions for the minotaurs within society?

Since there is no ancient Greece in the setting it must have different origins.  Silence is the minotaurs code of conduct (think of it as a form of honor), and yes, part of Silence is not expressing your desires.  That doesn't mean they're not permitted to want, or even to act to bring about those things that they want; they just cannot express themselves.  Why not?  Well... Silence allows a minotaur to control himself.  When he breaks silence, he may lose it and go frantic (like... a berzerker or a werewolf).<br/><br/>So, yes, if my Advocate minotaur spends a scene counseling your Soldier minotaur, that might be a quiet chat.  But the game is as much about actions as it is about words.  Let's say your Soldier works as a caravan guard for a spice merchant.  You return to the mansion with a supply train filled with merchandise and find that the merchant has beaten and maimed his wife in a fit of rage.  You have loved her, you call her Weeps Only For Children because to speak her name is an expression of your own want, and you have lain with her since you first took up employment with the merchant.  He beat her because he found out that she bore within her a minotaur to be.  <br/><br/>Your rage knows no bounds, but to break Silence would mean you run for the jungle.  You would escape the pain of the situation certainly, but the merchant would face no justice if you ran.  By the time you returned (perhaps bearing a new Name and a Gift from the Still Voice) the merchant will have laid the blame at your door, terminated your employment and placed a bounty upon your head.  But can you bear to stay?  To return to work for this man?  To count on the paid justice of the Empyrei to do right by Weeps Only For Children?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429179/#Comment_429179" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-06T12:51:00+00:00" title="March  6, 2014 12:51PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, Epengar, what Christopher and d.anderson said.

Given that the PCs are members of a literally-inhuman underclass in the city, I feel like the setting evokes tropes about racism, Othering, and systemic oppression that could be problematic if not handled deftly. Similarly, I can't tell from the descriptions given if the the code of Silence functions as another form of systemic oppression within the culture Paul is portraying.<br/><br/>How mechanically bound are the PCs to follow the tenets of Silence and/or obey the culture's laws? Is it mechanically possible / thematically appropriate for one or more of the PCs to utterly reject the tenets of Silence, or attempt to lead a revolt against the human society?

I interpret this as meaning that Minotaurs, culturally, are really invested in the City (the <i>only</i> civilisation) as their religious centre and place of enlightenment/realisation. That being said, if you were an orphan Minotaur raised as a vicious pit-fighter you might not have the same civilisation-centric commitment to Silence as a Watchman or Servant. Although, thinking about it, that's the origin story for Conan. And he found Krom, so maybe it's not all nurture over nature. <br/><br/>Man, I'm catching the crazy real fast.<br/><br/><i>[We're whispering behind the scenes here and a few Europeans have spoken up - still looking for more UK storygamers to get excited and form up the herd.]</i><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429209/#Comment_429209" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-07T10:44:31+00:00" title="March  7, 2014 10:44AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Herd?</i>  I think you mean stampede!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WMSkyfall" title="WMSkyfall"><img alt="WMSkyfall" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WMSkyfall">WMSkyfall</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429211/#Comment_429211" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-07T12:06:24+00:00" title="March  7, 2014 12:06PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the reasonably-reassuring answers.

Paul talks about several regions and locations, etc. in the book, but they're not plotted together at all.  In fact, the idea is mostly to teach you, as a prospective GM, how the setting works and allow you to create your own elements and tweak the ideas in the text to your own ends.  It's high setting, but low canon.\n<blockquote>What do the characters do in the game? ... These don't seem to be characters with power to change things, or even to live independent lives. Do characters gain power and independence as the game progresses?</blockquote>\nCharacters live out their lives as best they see fit.  They engage with NPCs and situations thrown at them by the GM.  They develop goals and hopes and seek to bring them to fruition and cope with the loss if they fail to do so.  And <i>yes</i> they absolutely gain power and independence as the game progresses in exactly the way you're wondering.  That's done by the Name mechanic which is some cool shit (and it requires engagement with the whole Silence/Degringolade/jungle dynamic).  Shall we discuss Name?\n<blockquote>I've a similar question to Epengar here. Given that the PCs are members of a literally-inhuman underclass in the city, I feel like the setting evokes tropes about racism, Othering, and systemic oppression that could be problematic if not handled deftly. Similarly, I can't tell from the descriptions given if the the code of Silence functions as another form of systemic oppression within the culture Paul is portraying.<br/><br/>How mechanically bound are the PCs to follow the tenets of Silence and/or obey the culture's laws? Is it mechanically possible / thematically appropriate for one or more of the PCs to utterly reject the tenets of Silence, or attempt to lead a revolt against the human society? Or are such actions "simply not part of <i>Clay</i>'s story?"</blockquote>\nSkyfall, Epengar's got the right of it.  Once you read the book and think it through a bit, I think, you come to the conclusion that <i>without</i> Silence, minotaurs aren't capable of co-existing with a human civilization.  I think they would be savage (in literal sense, uncontrolled, violent, etc.).  I think that's why they don't have Names to begin with too.  There's a lot going on in this area, thematically, with the game; we're not going to be able to tease it all out in this thread.<br/><br/>Mechanically, if you forsake Silence, you end up in the jungle all the time.  It might be fun to have lots of jungle adventures, but you'd never be able to affect life in the Degringolade or, certainly, bring the civilization to a new age of greatness.  You'd just be this random, uncontrolled, bull-headed Conan dude.<br/><br/>As for your concerns about systemic oppression, othering, etc... that's dicey stuff.  I've typed and deleted this part of the response several times.  Here's what I'll say:  The Clay That Woke isn't about slavery.  This is thematically significant territory that I don't think I should (and am probably not qualified to) speculate on.  Powerlessness and hope and weakness and strength, etc.  Don't worry that angle to death too much, give the game a read and see if you still have concerns, is my advice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429214/#Comment_429214" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-07T12:24:45+00:00" title="March  7, 2014 12:24PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 7, 2014 12:24PM by Marhault.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Man, I'm catching the crazy real fast.</blockquote>\nThank God.

As you go on, your minotaur will (should) grow in Name and become more and more able to make changes in the world of the Degringolade.  I find that kind of ability compelling, especially when it's baked into a game.  I always wanted a D&amp;D game where my adventures changed the course of nations and resulted in real, tangible differences to the campaign world.  I think Clay delivers on that, if you run it right (and for long enough).\n<blockquote>What do I get to own in play, what can I control?</blockquote>\nYou get to own your character (and the appurtenant token supply) and <i>that's it.</i>  When we say Paul was tapping into the trad style of gaming, this is one of the things he worked toward.  GM controls the world and NPCs, Player controls their character.

Trad elements have a proud legacy, yo.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429446/#Comment_429446" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-13T12:45:56+00:00" title="March 13, 2014 12:45PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you haven't backed and want to do so, you're running out of time!<br/><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/252728880/the-clay-that-woke-an-rpg-about-minotaurs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/252728880/the-clay-that-woke-an-rpg-about-minotaurs</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429459/#Comment_429459" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-14T03:35:52+00:00" title="March 14, 2014  3:35AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 14, 2014 3:36AM by Potemkin.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, still didn't quite organise a Euro-herd yet!
