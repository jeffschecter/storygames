You come to a branch in the corridor. After some thought you decide to follow the left corridor. For whatever reason, you never come back and explore the route to the right.<br/><br/>Does it make a difference to play whether there was content to explore behind the un-explored branch? Does it matter to you as a player?<br/><br/>Let's say, for example, that the game has  GM, and the GM has prepared the next encounter. You'll get that encounter no matter which choice you make at the crossroads.<br/><br/>For a coutner-example, you're playing a store-bought module. There are rooms behind the branch that are detailed, but are never explored.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185498/#Comment_185498" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-31T11:58:07+00:00" title="December 31, 2008 11:58AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No to both questions.

Everything that is out of their sight has only theoretical reality - it can, will, and should be changed to suit the needs of the story. While you might have detailed huge swaths of the setting that the players will never see, it doesn't really matter until it impacts them directly. Even if it impacts them indirectly - and it should, or why the hell did you bother writing it? - it's reality is vague and amorphous until the moment it enters their perceptions.<br/><br/>That is: gaming is an ephemeral medium of art.

In real play what you propose wouldn't even be a choice unless you gave some hints about the nature of the corridors before the choice were made. The only meaning two identical routes offers is that one might backtrack and explore both, but even then you're not actually giving the players a choice over the order of exploration if you don't give some information about the destinations of the two routes.<br/><br/>(Note that the players can generate this sort of information themselves in real play, if you allow it: they might send a scout to look at one of the routes and come back with a report, for instance. Then the choices would become real, as the players had at least some basis for making the choice.)<br/><br/>Barring that sort of reality-based argument against your set-up, though, I'd have to say that whether there were genuine content in the never-explored branch only matters as a basis for the contract of play - if we were playing a game where the GM has an opportunity to cheat and switching stuff around like that would be cheating, then it most certainly matters to me as a GM and player whether the GM was actually cheating. In some other games it wouldn't matter, or would even be expected. And no, I don't buy it for a second that cheating doesn't matter if it was never found out - the cheater himself knows what he's doing, and it affects himself even nobody else knows about it.<br/><br/>You ask about differences in play, though, and that's a bit trickier - of course our trust in the procedures of play matters, so if we're suspecting the GM of illusionism, say, and he's actually doing it or not doing it, that influences how we react to his play. Or if we're playing a store-bought module, that influences things quite a bit - we have reasonable faith in there existing solid preparation for the dungeon, and thus we're going to take the choice of corridors seriously. On the other hand, we're aware of how fragile such modules are, so we're not going to pick any third route - we pick a route that keeps us comfortably in the module space.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185505/#Comment_185505" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-31T12:15:32+00:00" title="December 31, 2008 12:15PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 31, 2008 12:24PM by Graham.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Loads of difference!<br/><br/>What was that thing Vincent said on his blog, a while ago?

Graham loses.]<br/><br/>Simon: Hah! I knock the gun out of your hand!</blockquote>\nVincent's point was that "I shoot you in the face" is an important part of the fiction, even if it didn't happen.<br/><br/>This is similar. That <i>something</i> behind the door, that you never discovered, is a strange, shadowy, important part of the fiction. It's more important if you know it actually was <i>something</i>.<br/><br/>And you know this intuitively from playing D&amp;D, right? When the GM says "Ah, if you'd been through that door?". And you say "What?". And he says "Ah, we'll get to it another time".

I think if stuff from the untaken branch suddenly intruded into the story in a really nasty way - e.g. "Well, the group of dark priests down the other corridor finish the demon summoning they were performing and the world ends in fire. Roll new characters." I'd have an issue with it.  Otherwise I'd probably be ok with missing some content.<br/><br/>I'd be even less concerned as a player (or as a DM for that matter) about what's down the other corridor if I knew we could probably come back to it later in another story. Assuming a volcano doesn't explode and destroy the dungeon ("In the Dungeons of the Slave Lords", anyone?) you can always reuse the material later.<br/><br/>As for the scene that happens no matter what, it would really depend on how the DM made the scene happen. Would he have to fiat my actions or bend reality in some totally absurd fashion?  If so, I doubt I'd be happy.  Is it something that's going to happen in the fiction that my character simply can't change? I might be ok with it, but it had better be a pretty damn cool scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185509/#Comment_185509" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-31T12:36:47+00:00" title="December 31, 2008 12:36PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with Eero and Graham.

I erroneously framed the experiment to include illusionism. That was a mistake. Let's say we're talking of the situation where there really is content and it really is skipped as a consequence of the choice. Maybe it's a 10 page write-up of a whole culture, maybe it's just some notes about a pack of kobolds with a wand of Evard\u2019s Black Tentacles.<br/><br/>Eero calls out an important point: the choice needs to make sense or it\u2019s meaningless. But look here: \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>(Note that the players can generate this sort of information themselves in real play, if you allow it: they might send a scout to look at one of the routes and come back with a report, for instance. Then the choices would become real, as the players had at least some basis for making the choice.)</blockquote>\nThat's interesting to me! In some social context, it's perfectly OK for me to give you a seemingly random choice. It's a challenge to you to find a way to make it meaningful. This is like <i>Storming the Wizards Tower</i> (which I'm reading today), where Vincent says to set up the situation without charting a solution. It's the players' job to craft a solution.<br/><br/>I like Jason's point. The content is skipped, but not wasted. It's not wasted because it's <i>alive</i>. Stuff can still be generated out of it into our shared world, even if, at certain points, the GM is the only one who knows it. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite><br/>And you know this intuitively from playing D&amp;D, right? When the GM says "Ah, if you'd been through that door?". And you say "What?". And he says "Ah, we'll get to it another time". That's much different from saying "Ah, if you'd been through that door, we'd have made something up."</blockquote>\nOK, I love this. The content behind the door is alive, and it's alive in a mysterious way. We haven't even decided when/where/how/if it will ever come up again. But just by being there it adds something to our game play experience. It makes the world wider. It feels wider to the players because there are real mysteries that haven't been explored. It's wider to the GM because there's an element lying in wait to be reincorporated later. There are good and bad ways to do this, but doing it in a good way provides some positive value to play.<br/><br/>Thank you, everybody.

If we are skipping color than there are no consequences. OTOH if we're skipping situation than it builds up drama. Saying "Choose a door, once opened the other door will disappear. Both eventually lead to the evil overlord's room but one is packed with goblins and other packed with kobolds" is very different from "Choose a door, once opened the other door will disappear. One is the cell of the wizard, once released he'll teach you the secrets that only he knows and the story will become one of power and quest for knowledge. The other door is the cell of the princess, once released she'll fall in love with you and you'll become the heir of her kingdom, the story will become one of politics, tradition and hard choices". As a player or GM I don't give a damn if I miss color or replaceable challenges, OTOH I like the thrill of a random decision that opens up possibilities while closing others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186887/#Comment_186887" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-08T13:34:16+00:00" title="January  8, 2009  1:34PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 9, 2009 3:11AM by Ajax_Aldwyne.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just had this experience as a player in a trad game (Nephilim,French version) - think classic Call of Cthulhu and you'll have an adequate image of the system -, playing a huuuge bought module ("Les chroniques de l'Apocalypse"). I am really impressed by the quality and the profusion of material in the module. This is important.<br/><br/>Our characters came to a door to another world/plane, a very nasty one probably created by a very ancient, powerful and probably hostile sentient creature. The characters knew that, and knew (a very lucky dice roll on my part) that our guide was trying to trap us, so they declined, stayed in their world and asked their guide to lead them to the real sport they were searching, which he did. End of session.<br/><br/>Between that session and the next, and at the beginning of the next session, I tried hard to convince the GM to allow us to explore the obviously wrong and deadly choice, as a kind of alternative <del>story</del> - that is allow us to drive our characters to their (very probable) demise and then rewind and go play the other choice. In video game terms: save and restore. I didn't convince the GM. I think the other players were interested, but not to the point of backing me up.<br/><br/>So, yes, to me, as a player, it makes a difference.

Left or right on a hallway in the dark is pretty irrelevant.<br/><br/><b>Point Two:</b> I don't see how a game world can not be a Schrodinger State World. The real world is, too, from a certain perspective. You never know what's true until you know it. I prefer a world that reacts to my character's actions, so I feel protaginized. Otherwise, if I make a - not wrong - <i>unexpected</i> choice, you might end up with "ok, three weeks later the world ends. Everyone having fun?" After all, the world isn't Schrodinger State, it's a living, breathing game world, and you guys just did something I hadn't accounted for and fell off the plot!<br/><br/><b>Point Three:</b> I see your point for certain values of tactics, but for me the details don't matter, at least not on such a minute level.

The branching hallway thing is actually a pretty poor starting point, because it's such an irrelevancy. The question we're really debating is this:<br/><br/>Should a campaign world be fully realized, where things are happening in a fully internally consistent way, or should a campaign world be a narrative construct keyed to respond to whatever the players of the game think is fun? Or (and this is the real question - both extremes are pretty much straw men) should it be some combination of the two, and if so, in what proportion?<br/><br/>Now, I will never call your fun bad - it's against my religion - but I am curious as to how you respond.<br/><br/>My opinion? It's about the <i>illusion</i> of consistency. I don't want my game world to be really happening, with my character simply plugged into it and hoping for the best. I get enough of that kind of crap in the real world. I want the campaign world to be about me and my issues. However, I agree that a game needs the <i>illusion</i> of consistency. Even though I know full well that X happened to my character because I used a narrative system to make it happen, or even because I said the GM "hey, wouldn't it be cool if..." there need to be compelling in game reasons for it to happen, otherwise my suspension of disbelief is strained, and everyone knows what happened if your strain your suspension of disbelief...<br/><br/>On some level, this may be a GNS question (for all that I don't 100% approve of leaning too heavily on GNS theory...). Narrative play, as a rule, tends to require that the setting respond to the demands of the story, whereas Simulationist play is more interested in consistency and verisimilitude. I want just enough realism to beat that little voice in the back of my head that says "stupid stupid stupid! Horses can't fly! No one will ever love you!" to death, but I don't need any more than that. Other gamers might be different. Remember, no one's fun is bad.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187252/#Comment_187252" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-09T14:19:49+00:00" title="January  9, 2009  2:19PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that skipped content only matters to me when I've been given a <i>taste</i>.<br/>\n<br/>\nWay, way back (1989, in fact) I hung out at a room party where Tracey Hickman (sp?) was holding forth, and the only thing he said that I remember (from, like, an hour of discussion) was roughly this:  "Every once in a while, when you've got some guy guiding your adventuring party through a forest, throw in a spooky looking tower off on the horizon.  'Oh, that is the Black Keep,' the guide says, 'a place of great sadness, and great pride, for my people.  But our path does not lead us there today.  Come!' ... and then never mention it again."

I was and it was good and for all Graham's teasing comment made me laugh, it didn't stop me immersing in my character or enjoying that.<br><br>And I get a similar feeling here. Is the enjoyment of the game so fragile that it hinges on whether the GM has put something behind a door or not? If your watching a film and the hero is in a corridor frantically searching for the MacGuffin, he tries one of the four doors and it's not there, but he finds it on door 2, does it spoil the film that you never know what was behind doors 3 and 4?<br><br>It's perfectly legimtimate to wonder what might have happened had anothe door been opened, would the zombies been lurking there, or he arrived too late to get the MacGuffin. All that kind of thing is fine. But it seems pointless to me to worry that director hadn't covered those bases.

Don't offer a choice unless it means something to choose, and both choices are meaningful.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you've got one encounter planned (or none!) <i>don't offer a choice</i> if either choice leads to the same place.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this case, if you offer the choice, you should at least have considered what will lie down either path, even if it's not a fully planned encounter.. and there should be some indication. One path leads downward, and the faint smell of decay drifts up toward you. The other path has a faint flickering light, and you hear the distant sound of rough merriment. This gives the players a frame of reference. Sure, they don't know (and you might not have really decided) what's down either path.. But if they go down the first path, they can reasonably expect to face undead, or some sort of darkness loving creature in it's den, scattered with the remains of previous victims, and the other path shouldn't surprise them if they come across a bunch of goblins feasting on human flesh, or another party of adventurers having a good laugh around the fire.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis can still allow for a completely improvised game, if that's your thing. You had no more idea of what they may encounter than they did before you presented the choice. Once they make the choice, it's meaningful, even if you then make up the specifics on the spot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187284/#Comment_187284" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-09T16:15:27+00:00" title="January  9, 2009  4:15PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 9, 2009 4:41PM by Graham.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So if you've got one encounter planned (or none!) don't offer a choice if either choice leads to the same place.</blockquote>\nWolfe, in my opinion, you're missing the best things in this thread, by reducing them to something you know. (This happens <i>all the time</i> and I'm sure I do it.)<br><br>Sure, illusionism is bad. But that's not the thing. The thing is about bits of the story that were <i>promised</i> but don't happen.<br><br>Steve, the point about what the story excludes is interesting, but I think the comparison with film is inapt. For me, the undiscovered-story-behind-unopened-doors is specific to roleplaying games. It doesn't mean you should plan everything, behind every door: just that if you do, it changes things.<br><br>For example, let's say we're looking for secret passages. If you're improvising a game, we all know the outcome: we haven't decided whether there's a secret passage there, but we'll decide after the roll. If you're running a scenario, something subtler is going on: there might be a secret passage there and, if we succeed, we'll find it. To me, that's exciting. Even if you don't find it exciting, I think it's different.<br><br>(Tony explains it beautifully, I think, with his Black Keep quote, above).<br/><br/>Graham                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187307/#Comment_187307" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-09T18:12:26+00:00" title="January  9, 2009  6:12PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham,<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter re-reading your post a few times, and scanning back through the thread, I believe you zoomed in on the least important thing I said, and decided that it was my whole point. Which, really, is easy to do, considering I said it was the important point. But it wasn't, really. Or rather, it wasn't a complete thought by itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you say "bits... that were promised but don't happen" are you referring to what exists behind those doors that never get opened? Because your phrase suggests entirely something different to me. It suggests that you said "this <i>will</i> happen" and it doesn't. The things behind the unopened doors is more of a "this is a <i>possibility</i>; Do you choose to see it for yourself?"<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, improv doesn't necessarily mean that it's decided after the roll. In my own gaming, I'd say that was the case less often than not, unless the game rules specifically said that was how things should work. Running more traditional games, or games that didn't specifically offer player authorship, it was more like the player would ask if there was a secret passage. In the moment before answering (I might stall by pretending to check notes or roll a die, or I might simply be more open about it) I would decide the answer to the question. Does it make sense? Would it be more interesting? If I decide there is, they'll roll for it, as appropriate. If I decide there's not, I may simply tell them no, or I may have them roll, if that seems more interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point I was attempting to make was more.. Make it meaningful. You don't have to have fully developed the content down the unexplored path, but make a decision about what the choice means before you offer it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to answer Tony's questions directly:<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Does it make a difference to play whether there was content to explore behind the un-explored branch? Does it matter to you as a player?</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nIt can make a difference to play if you choose to make it so. As a player, I rarely care about what didn't happen, but I do care about what *could* happen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188301/#Comment_188301" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-14T12:55:07+00:00" title="January 14, 2009 12:55PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One interesting side point to this whole discussion:<br><br>In my gaming experience, I've seen many, many instances of GMs working hard to maintain the illusion that "there was something behind every door". It was a weird sort of pretense, since everyone (usually) knew it wasn't likely, or maybe even possible. <br><br>The players would say, "Oh, man, I wonder what was behind door <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>!"<br><br>The GM would answer, "Well, I guess you'll never know now that you've left the island!"<br><br>...but really, the GM was thinking, "Oh, thank goodness. I couldn't think of anything to put there," or maybe, "That was a close one! I would have had to make something up on the spot, and they would surely have caught on <i>this time</i>."<br><br>And from the players' perspective, it was a bit like calling the GM's bluff: well, <i>maybe</i> she did have something prepared, and maybe she didn't... I wonder which?<br><br>I remember the day when I realized that, as a GM, I didn't have keep up this sort of pretense. It was very liberating.<br/><br/>I think now that the players will generate their own suspension of disbelief, if they're into the game. If the game is awesome, no one seems to wonder or care so much about this stuff.<br/><br/>(That said, let me also second the "Black Keep" idea: always, always give some kind of hint or taste. That makes those choices meaningful and interesting, and brings the world to life. It also limits the GM a little in terms of railroading power: it forms a creative constraint to further developments. Very powerful tool! You'll notice Tolkien uses this all the time in Lord of the Rings.)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188304/#Comment_188304" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-14T12:59:36+00:00" title="January 14, 2009 12:59PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 14, 2009 1:01PM by Paul_T.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, someone made another important point:<br/><br/>You never really know what the GM has made up. <br/><br/>Here's my take on it:<br/><br/>If you know I have nothing prepared, but then I pause to think for 5 seconds and say: "Okay, there's a huge iron door, and the handle is covered in scratches, gouged about two inches deep."<br/><br/>Well, I <i>might</i> just have invented a funky door.
