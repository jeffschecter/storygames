Since it's got a universal resolution mechanic (ability score + card + possible trump vs difficulty + modifier), and combat is just a factor of that mechanic, I'm thinking social actions could be handled the same way. The score to beat would usually be average difficulty + presence or wealth. The damage is properly abstract - wounds don't kick in unless a dragon card was played, otherwise it's how you interpret it, and depending on the cards in your hand you have more or less capacity to handle it from round to round. If you pull it off successfully, such as by spreading a rumour or after a debate, after they lose they would be shaken by the result, fuming or otherwise preoccupied with the loss, and the reduction in hand size would reflect that. For NPCs, if sufficient damage is dealt to bring them to 0 essence or social status, they're somehow down for the count - not necessarily unable to fight, but socially or politically ineffective.<br/><br/>For PC vs PC combat, it could take on a quality like A Dirty World, in which words can hurt as much as weapons, for PC vs NPC I'm thinking perhaps subtract damage done from the difficulty of actions.<br/><br/><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071006190939/portnell.net/bob/games/mskit.zip" rel="nofollow">Click Here for a streamlined version of the SAGA rules, if you're unfamiliar with the system but are intrigued by the thread</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
