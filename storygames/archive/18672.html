That is because fictional positioning is just using narration in place of what GURPS players call a "physics engine", so the move mechanism parses very well. Also because moves work well as action-based instead of stakes-based resolution.<br/><br/>I very much  like to combine elements and ideas from "old" &amp; "new" school, without really caring if it was the authors intention to use it that way. The move abstraction really hits a sweet spot there for me: to the point where i can see a thread about technical move design to facilitate move improvisation and move interpretation . And playbooks encapsulate simple but extensible character designs like in "hero kids"&amp;others (or rather these others learned that trick from AW).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419359/#Comment_419359" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-01T08:01:32+00:00" title="August  1, 2013  8:01AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno, man, my answer in that thread was entirely predicated on a certain construal of what yuz all meant by "challenge-based play" which might have been totally tragic.

Is the GM a player? Are we competing to attain extra-fictional scores, or are our objectives defined in terms of the fiction and our positioning within it? etc.). And, like, if it's straightforward we shouldn't have to <i>presume</i> what it means!<br/><br/>My first thoughts are,<br/>a) the MC in Apocalypse World has an objective, an agenda, and is exhorted to Step On Up to pursue it in play (and the players have their own agendas as well); and<br/>b) that agenda is expressly NOT to just kill off, harm or frustrate the players, so the fact that the MC has a full arsenal of hard moves doesn't detract from what I'm saying, because hardness alone isn't what the MC need to attain her objectives. On the contrary, the challenge is to use the moves, be they harder or softer, at the right time with the right finesse.<br/><br/>But, yeah, I mean, I'll reflect on it more and I'll post again if something shakes loose.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419366/#Comment_419366" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-01T09:41:05+00:00" title="August  1, 2013  9:41AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm pretty sure that "challenge-based play" is just what I've been calling a certain type of gamism in an attempt to avoid unnecessary GNS terminology. I've used it in a pretty obvious way, it seems to me: play where the creative agenda is concerned with determining and resolving challenges. It's a wide conceit, of course, but it's worked for me because I've utilized it in an array with other concepts like "adventure gaming" and "D&amp;D" that, when brought together, slice down into a pretty specific sort of game. Of course the "challenge" is not just any creative challenge in playing a roleplaying game, but specifically the sort of challenge where it is entertaining to see whether somebody might succeed or fail with it; I wouldn't call it a "challenge-based game" if we played say Dogs in the Vineyard and everybody found it very challenging to portray their characters credibly.<br/><br/>As for Apocalypse World, I can't really parse what using a creatively well-defined game like that "for" some completely different purpose would mean. Would it be like taking the dice mechanics from it and slotting in e.g. a D&amp;D challenge framework? If we're just talking of the rules mechanisms (ability bonuses, 2d6 rolls, comparison against pre-determined "move" arrays), it doesn't seem to me to be a difficult proposition. If we're talking about the entire game, then the MCing routines and a bunch of the specific moves used in the game come in the way, I would expect.<br/><br/>Probably the deepest single issue that would come up would be in the fact that a lot of the choices in AW are either arbitrary or obvious in tactical terms; this is because they are choices about the value-set, and not about challenges. A different game, such as D&amp;D, might deal with this sort of thing by having the value-set (the mission parameters, in other words) be very clearly pre-established, so that during execution of the scenario there isn't that much ambiguity about it. AW, on the other hand, has plenty of crunch that specifically attempts to question who your character is or why they do things or what they should even be doing. Of course a lot of this could be stripped out by rewriting the moves to be more relevant tactically, and less relevant thematically.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419367/#Comment_419367" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-01T10:40:31+00:00" title="August  1, 2013 10:40AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's quite right. Eero, you're the one I got the term from (and maybe the only one to use it, for all I know). It's not terribly specific; but hopefully the people reading this thread who have had experiences with Apocalypse World in a playstyle which sounds like it could fit in this category can tell how they did and how it went.<br/><br/>Adam pointed out one issue with using AW-style rules for a challenge-based style of play. I feel that the rather pragmatic approach to resolving difficult situations, through static moves and static ability bonuses, make it difficult to play for positional advantage: it would seem to me that in a challenge-based game you'd be stuck with either always playing to your character's strengths (if you have a particularly unusual advantage of some sort) or trying to avoid rolling altogether. There aren't all that many ways to influence the outcome of the moves or the odds of the dice, which are designed to create interesting and dramatic events rather than to reward the players for clever positioning. (I'm happy to be proven wrong if that is the case: this is a fair bit of conjecture on my part, and the only reason I mention it is because at least a few people have chimed in to say the see it the same way.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419373/#Comment_419373" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-01T12:06:37+00:00" title="August  1, 2013 12:06PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 1, 2013 12:13PM by J_Walton.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Murderous Ghosts is explicitly challenge-based at its core.

Also, many of the Sundered Land games, such as Doomed Pilgrim, are competive. The crowd players in Doomed Pilgrim are trying to stop the protagonist from reaching their goals. And both Murderous Ghosts and Doomed Pilgrim are really difficult to survive.

Take Dungeon World as an example. Maybe it's the giant armored centipede from the other thread. I view this as a big challenge for the players to overcome. We don't really care about how they feel about it or what it signifies or whatever. We want to know will the PCs overcome the centipede or will it kill them; pretty basic challenge.<br/><br/>If I'm the MC, when can I damage the PCs? Well, (1) when the fiction allows me to, which doesn't work if they stay far away from it or if the centipede isn't in position to harm them; this seems exactly like D&amp;D; (2) when they roll 7-9 or 6- it's possible that I could do damage to them, but it really depends on what they're doing; if they do something really safe, then I can't harm them, but safe things are also probably less likely to overcome the armored centipede. So there's a trade-off of the PCs accepting risk in order to try to achieve their goals. Again, that seems exactly like D&amp;D, at least in my experience.<br/><br/>How much can I damage the PCs? Well, if it's a monster or a trap or something, I'm restricted by the damage listed for that thing. I'm also restricted by the fiction, in the case of things where the damage isn't explicitly specified. Things that would do only a little damage do a little damage. Things that do a lot of damage do a lot of damage. Again, just like D&amp;D.<br/><br/>So I guess I don't see the problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419384/#Comment_419384" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-01T13:03:18+00:00" title="August  1, 2013  1:03PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno nuthin about this GNS crap, but I have used the Apocalypse World rules to run what was essentially old-school D&amp;D, for the people I play old-school D&amp;D with.

(I believe that falls under challenge-based play, but it wouldn't subsume it.)  Sure, ogres hit X hard, but nothing but sense stops you from having infinite ogres attack, or having the ogre secretly be a drow wizard in disguise.<br/><br/>I would say that it is common and more likely that in challenge based play if the fights are too easy the GM will modify them on the fly to keep things interesting.  Hell, if they don't, they're probably having less fun -- unless the majority of fun had at the table is an exercise in character mastery and just watching the havoc they wreak.

It can be confusing if you're just looking at the moves and trying to do what they say.<br/><br/>In every AW-based game that I can think of, when you get a 7-9 or 6- result, it's NOT that some totally new bad thing happens (that would be zany and random!), but typically that the PC suffers whatever danger or peril or choice or whatever that is ALREADY HAPPENING. So, if it's clear in the fiction that the monster and the PC are battling on the edge of a cliff, then it's totally cool for a failure to mean you fall off the cliff. As a fan of the characters, I might say "roll Defy Danger/Act Under Fire to see if you can grab hold of something as you topple," but you wouldn't necessarily have to do that, depending on the context. But if the cliff was never something that was clearly important in the fiction, then it's not really fair for the GM to suddenly introduce it. Likewise, I could have a totally unseen and unmentioned trap open up beneath the characters feet, but only if we're in a place where traps like that are obviously something that we all might suspect from the tone of the fiction, like a dungeon or someone's secret chambers or something.<br/><br/>Basically, the risk is usually the most obvious thing and only in very rare cases a danger that hasn't been discussed in play before. Even in the case of the trap, it's possible that the presence of traps could have been hinted at or explicitly warned about earlier in the game. If the dungeon is called "The Mechanical Mazeway of a Thousand Deadly Perils," then I can probably make trap moves whenever I want!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419390/#Comment_419390" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-01T14:36:41+00:00" title="August  1, 2013  2:36PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah: AW itself, hard to run in challenge-mode.

For one, moves don't deal harm exactly (at least not a specific amount), only the fiction does. The two Hard moves just tell you happens in the fiction and then you have to convert it into harm and remember to roll the harm move, which gives you more fiction (and sometimes harm). I still find fights (and other situations) to be incredibly challenging and strategic, but there's less of a focus on hard numbers and perhaps even more uncertainty than in a DW fight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419399/#Comment_419399" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-01T16:39:57+00:00" title="August  1, 2013  4:39PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thinking a bit more, the things I find to be really tactical in AW are not single fights against one or more opponents but, like, strategic objectives.

Here's what worked and here's what didn't."<br/><br/>Those of you who have played World of Dungeons in this mode, how did it go? You know, in actual play, not in theory.<br/><br/>In particular, I'd love to hear what a typical "disarming a death trap" situation looks like in WoD. It seems to me that, were I running WoD and this happened, it would come down to trying to avoid the roll at all. Because I'm never going to get really great odds of success, and rolling to avoid a death trap is something I should never do if my goal is to survive as long as possible.<br/><br/>I have no doubt that a game like this CAN be designed using the Apocalypse engine at its base (thanks, Vincent!). I'm curious what in the design helps that process and what hinders it, and how that comes up in an actual game.<br/><br/>(Murderous Ghosts is a great example of a *World-powered game which can played in a Gamist mode. However, it hasn't been my experience that players who survive do so because they were really smart and tactical, whereas those who fail made stupid choices. It seems to be mostly a matter of luck -- I know the Gamble is a part of Gamist play, but it's not what comes to mind when I think of "challenge-based play". Incidentally, I think the reason Murderous Ghosts works as a Gamist design has a lot to do with how constrained the MC's role is, compared to most *World games. The MC spews forth fiction and adds Color to events, but the fate of the protagonist is almost entirely up to the cards.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419406/#Comment_419406" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-01T19:35:19+00:00" title="August  1, 2013  7:35PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>when you get a 7-9 or 6- result, it's NOT that some totally new bad thing happens (that would be zany and random!), but typically that the PC suffers whatever danger or peril or choice or whatever that is ALREADY HAPPENING. </blockquote>\nI don't think I knew that, but it makes perfect sense.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419408/#Comment_419408" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-01T21:05:07+00:00" title="August  1, 2013  9:05PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>when you get a 7-9 or 6- result, it's NOT that some totally new bad thing happens (that would be zany and random!), but typically that the PC suffers whatever danger or peril or choice or whatever that is ALREADY HAPPENING. </blockquote>\nI don't think I knew that, but it makes perfect sense.<br/></blockquote>\nSo I have a hunch... and it might be wrong, so check my thinking on this:<br/><br/>a) We're playing Apocalypse World. Someone's fighting on the edge of a cliff, a dangerous situation, and they miss a roll. The MC can: <br/><br/>* Say they fall of the cliff! (Including relevant damage and/or death.)<br/>* Say they're now in danger of falling off the cliff, and they must roll to Act Under Fire to avoid that sorry fate.<br/>* Say they're now in danger of falling off the cliff, if anything else goes wrong, because they've been maneuvered to the edge. "What do you do now? Do you keep fighting, know you're only one misstep away from death?"<br/>* Make an even softer move (including "offer an opportunity": "You're near the edge now, with your back to the abyss. But your opponent is charging towards you, and if you can get them off-balance, they might be unable to stop themselves in time. What do you do?").<br/><br/>All of these seem like perfectly legit moves to me, under very similar fictional circumstances.<br/><br/>I think an MC could choose option 1 in one "deadly cliff" scene, and option 4 in a similar scene much later in the same game, without that striking anyone as "cheating" or inappropriate. I also don't think the players would get involved in this decision under normal circumstances.<br/><br/>Now:<br/><br/>b) We're playing an old-school D&amp;D dungeon crawl (in the style of the "<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/7917/quick-primer-for-old-school-gaming-is-blowing-my-mind/p1" rel="nofollow">Old-School Primer</a>"), same situation.<br/><br/>My feeling is that the GM will be expected to make a ruling on how to resolve the situation, which may vary from GM to GM and game to game (with potentially just as much range in possible rulings . However, I think that once that ruling is made, the players will expect the GM to abide by it in similar future situations, judging it as setting a precedent for that game group and that particular campaign. <br/><br/>It's also possible (but not as universal, in my experience) that the players will get some input into this ruling ("Hey, in other life-or-death situations, like death spells, curses, deadly traps, and so on, there's almost always a saving throw put in as a last resort to save the character's life. Wouldn't it make sense that a hero in danger of falling off a cliff would also get to make a saving throw?"). The idea is to produce the most "fair" ruling possible, and stick to the expectations that creates for the remainder of the game/campaign: after all, in a "challenge-based" playstyle, it's important that the players can accurately estimate the threat present in various dangerous situations in order to make strategic decisions.<br/><br/>Eero's various threads on "challenge-based adventures" are a really thorough examination on this play-style, and it looks entirely unlike a *World game in a very fundamental way. <br/><br/>This is just one example, of course. But what do you think? Am I barking up the wrong tree? Is this some kind of brain damage talking here?<br/><br/>What would that same situation look like in your Gamist World of Dungeons game (if you've done this yourself)?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419411/#Comment_419411" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-02T00:00:27+00:00" title="August  2, 2013 12:00AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2013 12:00AM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I can't imagine how that works.

You can define, and invent details (because now that PCs are inspecting the map you made, they will probably want details), but you can't just add 20 wraiths.<br/><br/>Kind of the point of the original D&amp;D rules is that the DM has a dungeon, that is "real" in that it's already described and written down before play begins and that doesn't suddenly change in the middle of a game. Random tables produce spontaneous results and all, but those are also written beforehand. The DM may have to define aspects of the world in more detail for the players than is written down, but can't just make shit up and add it on the spot.<br/><br/>This kind of breaks down once characters are off the map, ie in civilized areas and whatnot, and obviously not everybody played D&amp;D like this all the time, but OD&amp;D is pretty much Dave and Gary using wargaming rules in order to do this, and this is the old-school/OSR D&amp;D that I am familiar with.<br/><br/>So in using AW rules to do this, obviously some things are a little different, but not horrendously so.<br/><br/><b>Different from normal AW:</b><br/><br/>- Play a game about exploring an unfamiliar place. So, don't use the first sessions stuff, don't follow the PCs around in their life. That stuff is not important unless and until they go back to town/civilization and it becomes important because you are expanding the game beyond simply "exploring a dungeon." Outside of blatantly allowing players narrative authority, there's one good reason to get them to contribute setting and stuff is so they can role-play characters in a familiar environment. And these characters aren't in a familiar environment be definition.<br/><br/>- You don't use principles like "draw maps and leave blanks," or "ask provocative questions and build on the answers," but you do "always say what your prep demands." I mean, you're still portraying a world and all that. It's just the primary focus of D&amp;D is the DM's map, while the primary focus of AW/DW play is the PCs -- in AW that's the PCs and their lives in this dangerous and hostile environment, in DW that's the PCs and the adventures they are on.<br/><br/>- You can still use fronts after the first session, but it's not really necessary. if the PCs have caused a ruckus in the dungeon, you might think about how the inhabitants react and how things change because of what they did, but you don't really need more than that (although it's worth pointing out that a game focused on thwarting the GM's fronts/threats is also a kind of challenge-based game).<br/><br/>- Typical old-school players don't use read a sitch or read a person that much, at least not the ones I play with. If they like gonzo science fantasy settings, they might use open your brain a lot, though. They don't tend to care much about Hx (or bonds) either. Sometimes we use random tables to generate prior relationships between D&amp;D PCs, but these are mostly for entertainment value.<br/><br/><b>Different from the old school D&amp;D I play:</b><br/><br/>- There's no rules for searching for and finding hidden things, so you either have to do it like the Old School Primer says and give it to them whenever they look for it, or try and adapt read a sitch or something.<br/><br/>- Fights are way faster (which is kind of the main reason I did this, actually). AW fights are faster then DW fights which are faster than D&amp;D fights.<br/><br/>- PCs are tougher (ie they can survive longer) and so they're a bit more defined at the beginning of play (unlike a 1st level D&amp;D guy who has a name and a class and nobody cares what his stats are). I'm not a particularly killer DM though, I tend not to care how deadly a dungeon is when I'm running it, so that didn't seem like such a change. Planet Algol Blair runs dungeons that are way deadlier than mine (although he allows resurrection in his games and I do not, so it sort-of evens out).<br/><br/>There's probably some other stuff that I just take for granted, but that's the stuff that matters from my perspective.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419418/#Comment_419418" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-02T06:57:15+00:00" title="August  2, 2013  6:57AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are pretty significant departures from AW RAW!<br/><br/>But aside from the Principles/Agenda stuff, I think there are a lot of <i>subtle</i> ways that Move resolution in AW points away from Gamism (and away from Sim, for that matter).

When the MC's agenda is to provide dramatic coordination and apply pressure to the protagonists, there's no conflict of interests. When the agenda is to fairly present and adjudicate challenges, I'm not sure that the MC has the right tools to do so.<br/><br/>Johnstone, how would the "miss while precariously close to a cliff edge" scenario play out in one of your dungeon crawls? How would you, as the MC, choose what hard move to make? Would you make an effort to be consistent in these rulings or not?<br/><br/>What if the players were competing with each other, as well as trying to "defeat the dungeon" (or whatever)? Would that change things?<br/><br/>It's always seemed to me that the unpredictable and dramatic nature of the AW system was an important feature of the design: it sends a clear message that no one's ultimately in control and things can go any which way at any time. One time you might go aggro on poor old Dremmer, and it's a piece of cake: you totally get the jump on him and he's begging for mercy. Another time you miss the roll and suddenly he's got a knife to your neck before you can even draw your gun. This is perfect for what the game does -- when we care about the characters getting into tough situations and being badass in them some of the time and going under completely some of the time -- but if you're trying to present meaningful and consistent challenge to the players it seems to be lacking in options to me. In Ron Edwards's terms, for example, there seems to be a strong element of the Gamble involved, but fairly little clarity over the Stakes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419432/#Comment_419432" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-02T10:02:14+00:00" title="August  2, 2013 10:02AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2013 10:03AM by J_Walton.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Paul:</b> I kinda get what you mean in terms of AW itself (it's not set up to be super-focused on challenges and overcoming them, though that's part of the game, sure), but for all possible *World games?

Monsterhearts you can't use to play old school D&amp;D at all (edit: by which I mean I personally wouldn't want to try it because I think it would be a train wreck). But I honestly don't know what "Gamism" and "Sim" actually look like in play, so I can't really speak to them.<br/><br/>Paul, yeah, I try to be consistent in rulings like that, whatever game I'm playing. Here's an example of what is different in D&amp;D and AW:<br/><br/>We're playing D&amp;D, our party enters a room in the dreaded Fortress Eibon. Blair the DM rolls some dice and discovers that we have encountered some monsters. He rolls a die for us and a die for the monsters and finds out that the monsters are not surprised by us, but we are surprised by them. So he rolls to see which of us, based on our marching order, the monsters attack. Some of them hit. One PC is wounded, and the 1st level Dwarf is even murdered outright. This is his first fight in the game ever and he has died, through no definite actions of his own aside from the vagaries of planning and random chance. Blair then stands up and announces he is going to have a smoke break and he will tell us what the monsters look like when he gets back (the general consensus is that this is hilarious).<br/><br/>In AW, you have to present the situation first, and allow the PC to react to it. They have several options: do something automatically effective, do something that requires a move, do something that is futile, or they can ignore the problem. The MC must then react appropriately. This is the formula I work with when running the game. So it works out like this:<br/>"The man-wolves rush you from around the corner, howling and beating you with their enormous clubs. What do you do?" There's no damage yet, but there's those four options:<br/><br/>1. Maybe the cleric has a magical Fire Shield amulet--the player says she activates it with a word. Okay, the man-wolves are engulfed in flame and retreat, probably. Probably no move is triggered. As the MC, I don't have that many options here, I have to give it to the player, she had a defence and she used it.<br/><br/>2. "I fight them off!" Okay so it's seize by force or hack n slash, depending on the exact rules set. So I go with the move.<br/><br/>3. "I try to talk them out of it!" Dude, everybody knows man-wolves can't be reasoned with. It's futile.<br/><br/>4. "I'm trying to dig the holy water out of my backpack." Uh, okay, but they are attacking you too. "Yeah, yeah, but I need to get this stuff out of my backpack!"<br/><br/>So in the case of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a>, or if the combat moves allows me to make a hard move, the man-wolves attack as normal. They do whatever it says they do when they attack (3-harm? 1d10? whatever).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419436/#Comment_419436" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-02T10:58:03+00:00" title="August  2, 2013 10:58AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1 to Johnstone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419437/#Comment_419437" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-02T11:00:40+00:00" title="August  2, 2013 11:00AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2013 11:04AM by Johnstone.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now if we move over to the clifftop fight situation, I agree with your assessment of the way the DM makes a ruling in old school D&amp;D. But I don't necessarily agree with everything in your AW/WoDU assessment:\n<blockquote>The MC can: <br/><br/>* Say they fall of the cliff! (Including relevant damage and/or death.)<br/>* Say they're now in danger of falling off the cliff, <b>and they must roll to Act Under Fire to avoid that sorry fate.</b><br/>* Say they're now in danger of falling off the cliff, if anything else goes wrong, because they've been maneuvered to the edge. "What do you do now? Do you keep fighting, know you're only one misstep away from death?"<br/>* Make an even softer move (including "offer an opportunity": "You're near the edge now, with your back to the abyss. But your opponent is charging towards you, and if you can get them off-balance, they might be unable to stop themselves in time. What do you do?").<br/><br/>All of these seem like perfectly legit moves to me, under very similar fictional circumstances.<br/></blockquote>\nI don't agree with the part I bolded, at least the way it's worded there (which might be for the sake of brevity, and if that's so, bear with me and I will explain). There are some moves in AW that say "act under fire" on a 7-9, but as the MC you only call for moves based on the fiction. Is the PC actually acting under fire in this situation?<br/><br/>So, for me, it is the same as the ambush situation. When the PCs are fighting at the edge of the cliff, I make it clear that the cliff is a danger right there. However, if falling off is guaranteed death, it's not really fair to make the PC fall off before introducing that as an actual danger/threat that the PC gets to react to. So, two characters engage in melee, the player rolls a miss. They can take damage from their enemy, sure. But if I decide they go over the cliff, then it's perhaps more of a soft move, or "put someone in a spot." They're going over the cliff, I ask what they do. I don't say "act under fire to stop from falling over," though. I find out what they are doing first. Maybe this character has a ring of feather falling? Maybe they want to catch themselves on a tree branch far enough down that their enemy can't reach them? We figure out what move they are making (if an) after they describe their actions or reactions to the situation at hand, and it doesn't become totally and completely irrevocable or unsalvagable for their character until they get that chance. In any case, I (try to) run all dangerous situations in this manner.<br/><br/>Present the situation, allow the PCs to react, then follow through on the consequences. This may be an incomplete explanation, of course, and the times when as the result of a miss I throw in a rather hard move from what you might consider a peripheral avenue, but this is my general mindset. And this is explicitly quite different from the wargames rules that D&amp;D uses, as illustrated in my D&amp;D ambush example above.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419438/#Comment_419438" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-02T11:36:59+00:00" title="August  2, 2013 11:36AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Johnstone,<br/><br/>Fair enough on the cliff fall thing: I just meant it as a shorthand for some kind of "put someone in a spot". Maybe in real life the MC would say, "The rock crumbles under your left foot, and suddenly you're tottering over the edge, your feet can't find purchase on the edge of the cliff. What do you do?"<br/><br/>The point is that, the MC can choose to have the PC fall off the cliff, or they can choose a softer move which gives them room to make another move first (and, yeah, it doesn't have to be Act Under Fire, of course).<br/><br/>So, sloppy writing on my part, but I feel my point still holds.<br/><br/>Now, you make a great point about the "MC move + what do you do" potentially putting more agency into the players' hands, and many versions of old-school D&amp;D potentially devolving into a series of die rolls (as in your example). But that's not what's in question for me here. I'm asking:<br/><br/>* In the AW framework, how does the MC's level of choice interact with the necessary agenda of creating fair opposition?<br/><br/>and<br/><br/>* How does the system provide the players with meaningful decision points which aren't arbitrary or too obvious?<br/><br/>I think talking about possible deep AW-hacks (including Murderous Ghosts) is a bit of a tangent. Of course we can design a deep hack of AW which does something like this, if we try hard enough. That doesn't tell us much about this question (unless we find that we HAVE to change everything, of course, which would tell us something).<br/><br/>If we need concrete examples, let's stick with World of Dungeons, AW, or DW.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419439/#Comment_419439" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-02T11:51:45+00:00" title="August  2, 2013 11:51AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Paul, I'm going to bow out because I don't really know what we're talking about anymore.

I thought that some people (including you and Johnstone) were saying that you had experience playing in a certain mode (Gamist, challenge-based, whatever you want to call it) with minimal changes to the AW engine.<br/><br/>Johnstone is referring to Planet Algol, which, as far as I know, is just reskinned AW (pretty much same moves and principles).<br/><br/>You mentioned playing old-school dungeon crawls with World of Dungeons.<br/><br/>So I just want to know more about what that's like. It's hard for to imagine how you get a hardcore challenge-based adventure approach out a system like AW/WoD (which seems to me to be designed in a very different direction), so I want to get a glimpse into your world.<br/><br/>I feel pretty confident that if I tried to play that way with either AW or WoD, I would fail pretty hard. As an MC, I would have to construct some different structures for myself in order to be able to "play fair" (such as using a pre-written module, for example). As a player, I would feel that I had no grasp over the Stakes of various game moves and thus I'd be shooting blind, so to speak.<br/><br/>So I want to know how you guys do it! That's all.<br/><br/>(And I'm speaking to you because you've engaged me in this thread.

I know Vincent claims to do better in the game than other people, but it's hard to see how that can be done without very deep knowledge of the game's design: the fiction itself does not provide sufficient clues for most -- if not all -- new players.)                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419441/#Comment_419441" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-02T12:21:08+00:00" title="August  2, 2013 12:21PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2013 12:22PM by Johnstone.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Oh, crossposted.</i>\n<blockquote>But that's not what's in question for me here.

The fair deployment of opposition, fairness in adjudicating, portraying, describing, running opposition, yes, and that's what I explained above. But in actually determining what the opposition is and what it can do? It is the same in D&amp;D as in AW: describe the world as it is and how you (the DM/GM/MC) think it should be. The only caveat is that the PCs have to have options. Even if the opposition is really powerful, it can't just come and kill all the PCs right away. But aside from that, it's not the GM role's responsibility in either game to make sure the opposition is weighted properly with the PCs.<br/><br/>But I'm not sure if that's what you mean at all.<br/><br/>I'm also not sure what you mean by the second question. The fiction itself provides all sorts of decision points which aren't arbitrary or too obvious maybe? Like, you can't solve real post-apocalyptic problems with the basic moves in AW. You can only solve movie problems. Which is similar to OD&amp;D, where you can only solve wargames problems with the rules. For the fictional problems, you have to use fiction. I dunno if that has anything to do with your questions though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419445/#Comment_419445" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-02T12:38:08+00:00" title="August  2, 2013 12:38PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2013 12:45PM by Johnstone.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It might be good of me to throw in a few caveats?<br/><br/>There's tournament style D&amp;D, where you've got characters appropriate for the module, and it's the module designer's responsibility to make sure the opposition of the module is in-line with certain character levels. I play the other style, which is usually called sandbox but I hate that word because it has several different definitions. So yeah, you put the 1st level characters in surroundings that 1st level characters can handle, but you wouldn't have much of a game if you didn't. They can still go places where there's much stiffer opposition if they want to risk it, though. Many times this is telegraphed to the players, like in the case of dungeon levels -- the further down you go, the tougher the monsters get. But if you don't keep pushing up against more and more powerful threats you won't level up because: treasure.<br/><br/>Also, I maybe don't keep the agenda, principles, and moves out in front of me as much as other people (or as much as people say you are supposed to?) or use them super-strictly when I run a game? I dunno. I see them as a sort-of recipe, sure, but I am more concerned with the actual game that they are supposed to provide, so I tend to keep that in mind before everything else. Like, I'm not looking at the MC rules thinking "as long as I follow these, the game I want will naturally happen, born out of them." I look at them, think "oh, so the game is like X and not like Y," and then I use the MC rules as backup when I'm struggling to stick to that overall vision. So I feel like the biggest change there is familiar vs unfamiliar environment, whose prep matters and how, and character goals, maybe.<br/><br/>Oh and yeah, it was Planet Algol, in both my original 2011 draft and with some of the newer rules that are in the draft I finished last month. I ran Dungeon World for my D&amp;D buddies too, once, but I ran that as improvy Dungeon World (+Dungeon Planet), though, not as old school D&amp;D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419446/#Comment_419446" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-02T12:40:18+00:00" title="August  2, 2013 12:40PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2013 12:42PM by Paul_T.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Johnstone,<br/><br/>Yeah, sloppy writing on my part. By the first I meant "fairness in adjudicating and running opposition". I'm not sure how this can be done (hence the cliff fall example, but it applies to a much more broad range of issues -- let's say there's a goblin who twirls a chain with spikes: do you need to Defy Danger just to get into range to attack it, or not every time? How does the MC stay consistent with these judgement calls? When combat could require many, many rolls but social contests usually just take one or two, are the various classes balanced? And so on).<br/><br/>By the second I meant: given the simplicity of the design of the moves, and the way the probabilities work, it seems like most of the time the players' choices are either arbitrary or simply too easy to make. It's incredibly coarse-grained: if I fight this enemy (or disarm this trap), will the MC decide that I'm a) making a move that's dangerous for me (e.g. Defy Danger or die), b) making a move which is pretty favorable to me (e.g. Defy Danger or you don't get an advantage in the fight), or c) I get to do it without a roll. It also seems like the latter is always the best choice, so I would imagine this type of play would turn into trying-to-avoid-rolling-the-dice, like low-level Thief skills in Basic D&amp;D. There's also no real way to model minor advantages or disadvantages (e.g. the high ground) or unlikely events, so it often seems like the recourse is to roll with the odds you already have or not to roll at all.<br/><br/>As yet another example, how would handle a group of characters competing in some kind of contest (e.g. a sprinting race, an archery contest, etc)? It all seems rather counter-intuitive to me, and I've always reasoned that this was because AW just wasn't designed to answer those kinds of questions.<br/><br/>If there's ways to work around these issues, that's what I am here to learn about!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419451/#Comment_419451" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-02T13:22:40+00:00" title="August  2, 2013  1:22PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2013 1:26PM by Johnstone.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh! Those kinds of problems. Hmm.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I can add more to address the first, then. I use the method I described above. I try to describe the situation in as much detail as the player needs to make an informed decision. If it's hard to get close to the goblin without taking a chain in the face, I try to make sure they know about it, so they feel like they have some agency. Like, you still have to actually learn how to be a good GM, you can't just follow rules, right? And you have to find a balance that your players will accept, too.<br/><br/>For the other issues, the easy way around them is to play Burning Wheel instead? Or a wargame? Well, lemme try these a bit at a time.\n<blockquote>By the second I meant: given the simplicity of the design of the moves, and the way the probabilities work, it seems like most of the time the players' choices are either arbitrary or simply too easy to make.

Act Under Fire/Defy Danger, sure, but many other moves have pretty specific triggers. But see, here I think you are looking at it mostly from the perspective of rolling well for moves = solving a problem. If all you are doing is "fight this enemy (or disarm this trap)" by employing a move (or other resolution thing) then you're basically playing a board game. What I see in the games I run/play is: You have a fictional problem, made out of fiction, and you use fiction to defeat it, stuff you make up. Rules get involved, too, and they determine results along the way, but it's the sum of everything that determines the end result, whether the problem is overcome or what. I don't see this as arbitrary, because it builds on what we know about the fiction that already exists. It's not making up stuff in a vacuum. That said, this still depends on what the people at the table think about it, and maybe we come back to the issue of fairness above. But the challenge in this type of game is more than just manipulating probability and mechanical resources and whatnot. It involves creative problem-solving in the fiction, too.\n<blockquote>It also seems like the latter is always the best choice, so I would imagine this type of play would turn into trying-to-avoid-rolling-the-dice, like low-level Thief skills in Basic D&amp;D.</blockquote>\nIf all the moves are like act under fire, then yeah, actually, not rolling is the best outcome. You want to avoid rolling dice as much as possible. Especially if you remove highlighted stats or XP for failure (after 4 sessions of World of Algol, the PCs had all 10 advances, so yeah, advancement needs to change a bit). But what about read a sitch or read a person? As the MC, I can lie to you about certain things--secret doors, skillfully deceitful NPCs, invisible people, etc--if you just look around. But if you use a perception move, I have to answer those questions honestly, and tell you what's hidden. Or see Hold Steady for example, you get more on a 10+ than just your fiction. Also, a 12+ in WoDu.\n<blockquote>There's also no real way to model minor advantages or disadvantages (e.g. the high ground) or unlikely events, so it often seems like the recourse is to roll with the odds you already have or not to roll at all.</blockquote>\nOh man, this one.

Unfortunately, you are in the dark, in a dungeon filled with hazards and monsters. So doing stuff without taking risks is going to be very challenging! (and, very satisfying when you pull it off)<br/><br/>EDIT: Oh, and I guess I also need to say this:<br/><br/>In WoDu, the GM doesn't invent challenges and risks for the sake of inventing challenges and risks. The GM invents the fictional landscape, according to the <i>style of fiction</i> we've all agreed to explore , which, by its very nature (horror/survival dungeon adventure) includes challenges and risk. The GM's only job is to bring <i>that style of fiction</i> to life in the shared imagination of everyone playing -- and we have chosen a fictional landscape that includes features like dangerous battles, vicious monsters, hazardous environments, evil sorcery, etc. because that's the sort of fiction we want to engage with.<br/><br/>Therefore, any challenges and risks encountered must be evident to all of us in the fiction as established (even when they're a surprise to our characters, they are always a feature of the style of fiction we've chosen). They're not limitless or arbitrary, and they don't need to be "consistent" (as in, "you <i>always</i> Defy Danger with DEX to close in if they have long reach"). They spring from the concrete fictional details, established in play moment-to-moment -- plain to see, ongoing, enthusiastically ratified by all players.<br/><br/>Our characters, of course, will seek to win their goals but avoid these risks by careful maneuvering and bold gambits, and in doing so will encounter yet other challenges and risks (due to the nature of the fiction we have chosen -- dungeon delving is <i>inherently risky</i>; the well of troubles is bottomless, so to speak).  We all delight in this tension and in discovering through play which challenges and risks are faced or avoided, overcome or failed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419453/#Comment_419453" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-02T14:02:54+00:00" title="August  2, 2013  2:02PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, we may have had some terminology confusion.

Like, are the players or groups of players who really suck at it and so they consistently die all the time, versus other players who are genuises and always survive and prosper (or at least tend to)?<br/><br/>(My hunch is that in these games, if this gradient exists, it has more to do with creative energy and enthusiasm and taking risks and entertaining everyone -- not so much straight-up cleverness and wits and one-upmanship. Kind of like Murderous Ghosts, the actual death rate is more of a gamble than a straight-up measure of your skills as a player looking to survive and prosper.<br/><br/>If your experience is different, I want to hear about it in as much detail as you can manage! That's what I'm curious about.)<br/><br/>My questions here are highly inspired by Eero's D&amp;D/challenge-based adventuring threads here on Story Games. A different way to phrase my question here might be: "Have you ever done <i>that</i> with World of Dungeons? If so, how?"<br/><br/>I certainly understand that all these things (like tactical challenge) *can* be involved in the game; my concern is that they don't seem to be very well supported. Consider a situation where two opponents agree to meet for a duel. You learn through investigation that your opponent will be wearing chain mail, so you scrap your plan to bring your sword and you bring a spiked mace instead, figuring your opponent's chain mail will be pretty much useless against that, giving you an advantage. As a WoD MC, I'd get a headache trying to figure out how to make that meaningful in their fight! (And especially doing it in any kind of consistent way in future situations.)<br/><br/>Eero's description of play had as a very important feature the communal establishment of certain norms: clear expectations allowing the players to gauge the risk inherent in certain situations, and decide on a course of action accordingly. It's pretty hard for me to imagine challenge-based play without that feature, and establishing it in a WoD context appears to me to be fairly difficult. ("Ok, the boulder is coming towards me. How will we handle it if I duck to the right, under the bridge?" "We'll roll to Defy Danger." "What if I try to hunker down between two tree trunks instead, to see if it will miss me." "We'll still roll to Defy Danger, unless you can come up with something which would convince me you don't need to roll at all." "Well, crap. So I'll do one of those, I guess.")<br/><br/>The rules appear to me to model unpredictability more than nuanced risk, which makes this kind of situation difficult (sure, not impossible, but difficult). And the granularity is huge, which means various possible solutions to fictional problems could have exactly the same mechanical odds and/or consequences. (Again, not impossible: it just seems like a poor match.)<br/><br/>Johnstone, <br/><br/>I'm super excited to find out there's finally a new version of World of Algol! I'll go check it out right away. I really enjoyed the original.<br/><br/>You also make a good point about certain moves by-passing the skills of the players (like various Reading moves: you don't have to be smart, you just need to have a good Sharp or Wisdom or whatever and you can roll and get the goods). Dave mentioned this earlier, upthread, as well. That seems like another potential hitch in trying to make this kind of game work.<br/><br/>akooser,<br/><br/>Can you relate how the game went?

If there's a single hallway, can a fighter Hack N Slash against all of the advancing goblin horde at once, holding them off a bit? Maybe! If an enemy sneaks up from behind, can it just stab you through the chest, without you being able to do anything about it? Maybe!</blockquote>\nThe question is, for you in practice, what does that "maybe" for extra opponents depend on?  For example, Gwen the fighter is off by herself in a wide hallway when two orcs rush out of the darkness at her.  She backs up towards the wall to defend against them while lashing out at them with her sword.  Does the second orc do damage regardless of roll (i.e. the usual in John Harper's games, as I read it)?  Does the second orc do damage only if she fails her Hack-and-Slash roll (i.e. the usual in my games)?  Or something else, like making her roll both Hack-and-Slash (for one orc) and Defy Danger (for the second orc)?  </blockquote>\nIt seems to me that there's a) no clear answer, and b) no reliable Principle the MC can use to make a call.<br/><br/>I'd consider this a feature in a Narrativist or drama-driven playstyle, not a bug. But adapting it to a competitive game designed to challenge players seems to be going against the grain a little. (I'd love to hear how I'm wrong, if that's the case, of course. I haven't played these games as much as you guys have, so I'm ready to have my perspectives broadened. But be specific, please!

Also with the tropes of D&amp;D, maybe. I am the most skilled and dedicated strategic player I know. I gather the various map fragments and photoshop them into a coherent megadungeon composite and study to figure out where we should go next. I think about the odds of raiding different sections of the dungeon and come up with longer-scale plans than other players. Most of the other players are more reckless than I am, which sometimes comes with really big payoffs, but also means they lose 5th level characters more often than I do. They also tend to know the specificaly D&amp;D things, like monsters and iconic spells. But gauging difficulty applies to more than just the action-level (and often doesn't really apply to the action-level at all except for combat). It's not so much "how dangerous is this trap" but "how dangerous is this whole area?" Also the challenge part of it has to do with getting the treasure out of the map. I don't really think there's that much "one-upmanship" per se, because it's not a (direct) competition between anyone. It's just that the map is a difficult puzzle, and we are trying to defeat it. So outright cleverness can definitely be a factor. What I remember of Eero's threads was that, well, he was playing old school D&amp;D, so I thought he was talking about the same stuff?

There is a pretty huge difference in play between the two.<br/><br/>If you haven't read the "Old School Primer" it would probably help the conversation (assuming we are talking about old school and not new school) -- because I feel that is fairly close to how Dungeon World or World of Dungeons <i>can</i> be played. A lot depends on how the group itself is playing though too!<br/><br/>There was also a thread a while ago on EnWorld about "<a href="http://www.enworld.org/forum/showthread.php?317715-Very-Long-Combat-as-Sport-vs-Combat-as-War-a-Key-Difference-in-D-amp-D-Play-Styles" rel="nofollow">combat as sport vs. combat as war</a>".

The strategic aspects move up to the higher level in this style of play: it's more about deciding whether to delve deeper and whether to fight or retreat, and where there might be hidden areas of the dungeon, and so forth. That's exactly the kind of challenge-based adventure dilemma I'm talking about!<br/><br/>I suppose this is one good way to get a handle on a proper, challenging approach to this style of gaming, and, as irminsul points out, not all that different from old-school D&amp;D. I'll keep this in mind! Those higher-order strategy decisions were definitely always a part of old-school dungeon delving: why shouldn't they be present in a WoD game or something similar? Great point.<br/><br/><br/>irminsul,<br/><br/>I'm certainly familiar with the Old-School Primer (you'll see I mentioned it above), and that's exactly the style of play I'm talking about.<br/><br/>The main difference I see is that in an "Old School Primer" type of game there's a native tendency to make fair rulings and then to abide by them. (You see this all the time in those old D&amp;D and pre-D&amp;D publications: "In the Brownstone campaign, pointed weapons like spears and arrows received a +1 bonus to hit against chain mail, but in Betty's game Armor Class was considered an abstraction...")<br/><br/>That seems to me to be very difficult to do in WoD or a similar game.<br/><br/>Again, how would you address some of the examples, above? What principles can the MC use to make disciplined choices when faced with a) a character in danger of falling off a cliff, b) two enemies ganging up on one defender, or c) a character going for a truly "long shot", risky attempt like putting an arrow into a bull's eye in the face of a strong gale?

AW moves <i>don't</i> (necessarily) bypass player skill, because the dice don't measure the success of the abstract "seize by force" or "read a person" move, they measure the success of the actual, specific action undertaken by the PC in that moment. It's only act under fire and defy danger where you get to just keep narrating your actions on a 10+ and that's all.<br/><br/>For example:<br/>Say your AW PC is armed with a knife and is fighting a dude in an awesome 3-armour combat suit. Probably the stupidest thing you can say is "I stab him with my knife." Even on a 10+, you can only do 3-harm max, which does nothing. All you got is you can reduce his damage to you by 1.<br/><br/>What if, instead, you say "I trip him, knock him down, and pin him"? On a hit, you are supposed to be able to do this, in which case you have him pinned, and then putting that knife through a seam in his armour shouldn't require another roll.<br/><br/>Now, granted, seize by force is rather forgiving, in that it allows you to seize hold as an option. A forgiving MC might let you trip this dude and pin him even after you say you just stab him. Or, she might let you grab hold of him while you stab ineffectively, but she won't let you pin him down. Yet another MC might say this action is actually acting under fire, the fire being armour-dude pummelling you.<br/><br/>Other examples:<br/>If the duke has a secret door in his private chapel, you won't find it searching his mattress no matter how well you roll. If you have a gas mask on and you read a sitch, I don't have to tell you about the invisible poison gas until your mask-less comrade smells it an dies. If you bribe Junkie Fred with the uncut dope you got from Wisher and then you let him shoot up as part of your concrete assurances that you'll let him get high, he's still going to OD and die before he does what you want.<br/><br/>Let's go back to the cliff:<br/>Say we're playing Dungeon World, and your Fighter is standing at the edge of the cliff and I say the orc raider, steel bared, comes charging at you intent on murder. Let's think of some different possible options:<br/><br/>1. "I cross swords with him and drive him back!"<br/><br/>2. "I judo flip him over the edge of the cliff!"<br/><br/>3. "First I cut off his hand, then I cut off his head!"<br/><br/>A 10+ result for all three of these is going to be different, and they could even be different moves. Are they all hack n slash? Is the first one defend and the second one defy danger? You need to hash these things out, preferrably by asking for more detail with which to judge the situation.<br/><br/>But here's the thing, if you get a hit: First case, you will "drive the orc raider back" (meaning you don't fall off the cliff), plus doing damage, etc. Second case, you will throw him over the cliff, so it doesn't really matter that much that you don't get to deal your damage die. Third case, you will cut off his hand and send his sword flying, in addition to rolling your damage die.<br/><br/>That's what AW has instead of difficulty modifiers or bonuses and penalties for circumstantial (dis)advantage.<br/><br/>(This is also not the same as either looking for traps by asking the DM questions, as described in the Old School Primer, nor the same as just rolling a die to see if you find it when you search, but rather somewhere in between.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419470/#Comment_419470" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-02T16:38:55+00:00" title="August  2, 2013  4:38PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, I gave the clear answer and principle ("interrogate the fiction") in the other thread with John Kim.

A different way to phrase my question here might be: "Have you ever done <i>that</i> with World of Dungeons? If so, how?"</blockquote>\nThat's ALL we've done with World of Dungeons. How? The same way Eero does it. I guess I don't quite understand the confusion here. In the boulder situation, Eero might for a DEX roll. I'd do the same. Or it could be a WIS roll to spot that feature in the trees. Same thing in WoDu.<br/><br/>There are two things going on here: 1) House rules, building your game as you play and 2) "Same mechanical odds". I'll tackle both.<br/><br/>1)  House Rules<br/>When you play any old-school kind of game and you feel like there should be additional nuance and rules support <i>you add it yourself</i> as you go. House rules are a fundamental component of this type of play. You may have noticed in Eero's posts that the "rules set" used at the table is constantly being modified to accommodate the group. They invent the Paladin class when someone does a quest for it. They sometimes have non-magical first aid, sometimes not. If they all care a lot about the difference between a mace and a sword, they add it in. <i>But that feature didn't exist when they started playing.</i><br/><br/>Same thing with WoDu. You have one move to start with, and then you modify and build out your actual house rules as a process of play. We immediately added Last Breath from DW, for example. I give -1 or -2 penalties to rolls under certain conditions (like using a certain weapon against armor built to resist it). We use AW-style countdown clocks for things like quicksilver addiction and demonic influence. These additions and modifications are part of the play of the game (just as they were with Moldvay).<br/><br/>2) "Same mechanical odds"<br/>I think you're way too hung up on the "mechanically identical odds" thing. Lots of OSR-style games (Into the Odd, Moldvay D&amp;D itself) use roll-under systems, usually without modifiers. They're still totally challenge-based, obviously. In the boulder example, just because you might "make a DEX roll" in either case, the potential risks and outcomes for a given maneuver might differ <b>hugely</b> based on the specific fictional actions taken. Ducking right, under the bridge and hiding behind some trees are completely different moves that put you in different positions.<br/><br/>Maybe the bridge is closer. So it's easy for you to get cover and we roll DEX just to see if any of the shrapnel from the boulder hits you (d4 damage). The trees are far away. Maybe you can get there in time and avoid the boulder entirely, or maybe you're caught in the open and hit fully (3d6 damage). It really matters which one you choose! All fictional actions and their attendant risks and consequences are not identical (obviously) even if you make the same type of roll.<br/><br/>What you'll find when you play this way is that fiction doesn't have to mean "-1 to a roll" to have meaning. It has <i>much more meaning</i>, in fact, when the details of the action affect the whole situation around the roll -- why you make it, what you're risking, what you have to gain, what position you're in afterwards, etc.<br/><br/>If you ignore all of that, and reduce all of that nuance and detail down to "it's a DEX roll either way" you're missing what's fun about fiction-first play. This is why old-school challenge-based play is fiction-first. The tactical space is as deep as whatever level of detail you care to track. You're not limited by the "5-foot-square flanking bonus" set of options.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html

when you look at the new World of Algol, you'll notice there is no act under fire or defy danger move. All the moves have (hopefully) pretty clear triggers, and there is no "when you feel like something should be a roll, use this move" type moves. This is because when an action doesn't trigger a move, the GM decides what happens. No making a custom move on the spot! No randomizing! Decide!<br/><br/>And what you don't see is one of the GM tools: thematic principles. They're not there because I haven't bothered to write the rules for them down yet, even though I've had the idea for over a year now. So, you start with thematic principles to help you decide what happens, and you can write specific ones for specific places, etc.<br/><br/>They look like this:<br/>"All things being equal, on Planet Algol... hedonism and apathy always win out over both hate and love."<br/><br/>I remember coming up with a few more but I've probably forgotten them. Anyway, when you have to decide on something, well, you look at these, and there you are, you've already written down how your world works, what rules govern its depiction in the fiction of your game, and you can use those principles to help you decide what happens.<br/><br/>This is part of me changing AW to make it more suited for that/my style of old school D&amp;D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419473/#Comment_419473" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-02T16:45:12+00:00" title="August  2, 2013  4:45PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At least all three of us said the same thing while cross-posting <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419475/#Comment_419475" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-02T17:17:17+00:00" title="August  2, 2013  5:17PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fellows, thank you for all the great responses. One thing I should mention is that I'm very familiar with "fiction-first" gaming, both in the context of AW and in other ways (diceless play, old-school D&amp;D, FUDGE, Delve, etc). I understand how this works. I'm not looking to turn this into a boardgame. I'm just curious what "fiction-first" WoD play looks like in a challenging old-school dungeon crawl.<br/><br/>What I'm trying to say is that it seems to me that doing this kind of stuff in a Gamist environment sounds *difficult* to me, moreso than under other systems. <br/><br/>John, your example with the boulder is very instructive. You're changing the consequences of failure in response to a different approach to a challenge, and that's a solid technique. In this case, you're also specifying it upfront (normally in AW/WoD there is not required discussion of what happens on a failure, before a player has committed to a course of action). I have a vague feeling that wouldn't always be satisfying (how would you apply that to the chain mail example, in the private duel?), but if you say it is I can hold my tongue until I've tried it some more.<br/><br/>As for the toolkit approach to building up systems, I'm totally aware of that. (I have also read Eero's threads, after all!) That's actually precisely the very thing I find more difficult with, say, WoD than Basic D&amp;D. <br/><br/>D&amp;D is a much less unified mechanical chassis, there's lots of moving parts and things we can swap in and out. When someone misses a roll on a cliff, AW/WoD says: MC makes a hard move. In old-school D&amp;D, we'd probably stop and chat about it for a minute, decide on what we consider reasonable odds ("How about we handle this kind of thing with a saving throw/DEX roll? This game would be more fun if heroes always got at least some chance of avoiding certain death-type disasters..."), and then we have a solution to work with for the rest of the game (or even just the rest of the fight: the other combatants can now judge whether they want to take the risk to approach the cliff face or not, because they know how it will be handled), and roll for it. The responsibility for adjudication can be easily handed over to the entire group and then left up to the dice, and a precedent/common law is built in the process. In AW... how would we do that? It's an MC call, period, and I don't find it has a ton of support. (Again, assuming you're interested in testing the players' cleverness.)<br/><br/>Same goes for situations whose odds might be hard to model on a 2d6+stat, three outcome scale. You want to put that arrow into the guy's eye in the dark, even though he's moving really fast? "Ok, it's a -XXX penalty. Good luck!" Or maybe, "We'll use percentile dice for such unlikely cases, with the GM setting a very low percentage chance, with group input." <br/><br/>Johnstone, the cliff example as you describe is easy enough. The one I'm not sure about is the one I posted: we had the situation already, and the guy missed his roll. Now what? How do you decide whether to kill him or not? There's a huge range of possible MC moves, and no one knew what you would do before they engaged in the situation. Now what? How do you make it fair or principled? What's your decision matrix?<br/><br/>JWalt, this is not a good time for me to do this (probably until September), but I would LOVE to take you up on your offer to Hangout play this game. That would certainly clear up a lot of things, I suspect!<br/><br/>I think the thing that would help me the most (aside from playing with you, or seeing a video of you playing or something) would be if you could address my specific examples. I can repost them if it's hard for you to sort them out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419477/#Comment_419477" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-02T17:31:05+00:00" title="August  2, 2013  5:31PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2013 5:33PM by Paul_T.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the other thread (on teamwork), Jonathan posted an explanation of how he might handle an adventurer named Gwen facing down two orcs. I responded:\n<blockquote>I agree, it's hard to describe on the internet. JWalt's description is super helpful, though! That's about as good as you can get.<br/><br/>Don't you find it hard to be <i>consistent</i> with this kind of thing, though? OK, Gwen can roll Defy Danger and if she succeeds, she can just fight one of them at a time, at least for now. (For how long? Until the MC makes a move and decides to change that situation. That could vary a lot, especially if other characters were involved and the turn-taking wasn't so obvious.)<br/><br/>What if she was facing three of them? Four? What if she only had a *short* spear? What if the corridor was slippery? Etc.<br/><br/>I can't put my finger on it, but it seems to me that there's something about the whole model of Player move - MC move - Player move, roll - MC move, the AW conversation, which works against standardisation and against a clear representation and measurement of risks. It's much more art than craft.<br/><br/>For instance, if the corridor was slippery, the MC might be inspired to say she falls down ("put someone in a spot") as a Hard Move. However, in a regular, non-slippery corridor, the MC wouldn't say that, because it wouldn't fit the fiction. So she might have them deal damage, instead. (Of course, she could also say that Gwen fell down *and* got hurt, so the plot thickens...)<br/><br/>So, what? Now fighting in a slippery corridor is somewhat safer, because you might fall over and delay the death blow by another "turn" in the conversation, when the MC gets to make a hard move again?<br/><br/>This works really well in AW or Monsterhearts, where the art of handling the conversation and the moves is used to create drama and tension between characters: lots of unpredictable, rapidly snowballing situations.

Not even with the DM. In fact back in those days the DM was called the Referee and was told to be totally <i>impartial</i>. S/He simply adjucated what s/he thought was correct given the "fiction" (not a term we used back then, but still applicable).<br/><br/>We competed with the environment, dungeon, and monsters.\n<blockquote>Again, how would you address some of the examples, above? What principles can the MC use to make disciplined choices when faced with a) a character in danger of falling off a cliff, b) two enemies ganging up on one defender, or c) a character going for a truly "long shot", risky attempt like putting an arrow into a bull's eye in the face of a strong gale? (The details for the first two are earlier in the thread.)<br/></blockquote>\na) Sometimes the DM just said, "yeah, you're fighting next to a cliff and you <i>failed your roll</i> so the guy pushes you off. And you die. Guess you've learned you shouldn't fight on cliffs?". Or maybe, "I'll be nice and let you make a Saving Throw to save your sorry ass". And if the player makes the roll he's stuck hanging on by his fingernails to the cliff-face.<br/><br/>And I can see a WoDu GM saying the same things. Roll +dex or whatever. Or not, depending!<br/><br/>b) This one is principled because it not only depends on what is going on, but yeah, in OD&amp;D there are specific rules in effect here so we used those: the opponents rolled to kill each other with their murder-toys.<br/><br/>Same thing is going on in WoDu pretty much. The player is describing how they are reacting to the threat and is rolling (or not) dependant on the fiction. Maybe one opponent gets in a free hit? Maybe the GM allows a roll to dodge one and fight the other? Maybe one fighting roll is all that is needed to fight off both?<br/><br/>c) In OD&amp;D and WoDu the answer would probably just be: nope, can't happen. But maybe not. This is definitely a case of DM/GM judgement! Is the bow magical? Is the bowman super strong? Most likely the player would have to think of a better way to shoot the arrow. Me: I wouldn't allow it, because the fiction tells me not to (in OD&amp;D and WoDu).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419485/#Comment_419485" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-02T18:12:40+00:00" title="August  2, 2013  6:12PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Depends on the fiction.

I agree with that first part. Danger established, fictionally logical, then a missed roll. Totally legit to make the guy fall off the cliff. But... would you have them fall off every time? I mean, that would get boring. So sometimes you might make a different move, instead, right? <br/><br/>Let's say you had three people fighting in the same situation, all were aware that they were in danger of falling off the cliff. All three miss a roll in a fight with some bad guys. It's your turn to make an MC move. Do all three fall, or do they get different outcomes?<br/><br/>Here's where you need a principled approach which you can reliably return to, and that's what I don't particularly see in a game like WoDu (or AW). What <i>are</i> those principles you look to here? (The thematic ones are a great example, btw, and a useful tool. Not necessarily going to help you in every possible situation, though, right?)<br/><br/>The old-school D&amp;D approach is, either "DM makes a call, complain about it later if you want" or "GM makes a ruling, with implicit or explicit group negotiation, and this becomes the way to handle this kind of situation in the future". Often, the dice are used: it's easier to agree on odds and then roll than to agree on an outcome, period. So we say, "Ok, how about for this kind of stuff you've got to roll a 6 on a d6?" And that's what we do from now on.<br/><br/>I don't know if it's the best possible approach, but it's certainly time-tested and it's very clear and fair. If the GM, on the other hand, makes one character fall and die in that situation but gives another one a saving throw, all without making it clear that this is a principled decision (and how it will work in the future), I'd expect some unhappy reactions. <br/><br/>If you want to know who competes and how, it's exactly as irminsul described:<br/><br/>All the players compete with the environment, monsters, etc. The GM is a Referee. (Sometimes the players may wish to compete with each other on top of that, though.) I'm pretty sure we're all talking about the same thing here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul" title="Irminsul"><img alt="Irminsul" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul">Irminsul</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419486/#Comment_419486" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-02T18:19:53+00:00" title="August  2, 2013  6:19PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Do all three fall, or do they get different outcomes?</blockquote>\nI think it is fine for each GM/DM to have their own rulings here.

I really appreciate it! I believe there's some good fodder here, for game design, for community building (see below), and for the actual practice of roleplaying as an activity.<br/><br/>This is just a hobby and discussing it is something we do for fun. I know I'm not entitled to any answers: so feel free to bow out if this is not interesting or helpful for you. <br/><br/>I'll tell you why I stick with this discussion, though:<br/><br/>Every time I get into it (it's been a few times already, including a few years back when AW first came out), I get whispers from a variety of other posters saying, basically:<br/><br/>"I'm so glad you said this! I totally agree, but I'm afraid to say anything because I feel like I'm going up against this dedicated fanbase, and they're important people here." / "I'd chime in, but it's just too much trouble and people get their backs up."<br/><br/>So it's clearly not just me! (Other examples include Adam Dray and Eero, back at the start of this thread, but who haven't come back. They seemed to at least understand what I was talking about.)<br/><br/>One of the whisperers said I could quote some of his observations, which were quite good, and I think will contribute to this discussion, so I'll do that. Here's a message from towards the beginning of this thread:\n<blockquote><br/>Doing this:<br/><br/>   ...and then you structure the player-side moves to be about facing and overcoming challenges... (Jonathan)<br/><br/>and avoiding this:<br/><br/>   ...a lot of the choices in AW are either arbitrary or obvious in tactical terms... (Eero)<br/><br/>is kind of the whole deal.<br/><br/>Here's what Johnstone's account sounds like, to me: in old school D&amp;D, a lot of the techniques for challenge-based play have zero to do with formal rules, and everything to do with a direct GM-player interaction which rewards cleverness and punishes strategic failures. When the players opt to take a risk, or when they screw up and get in trouble, then some of what ensues is randomized with die rolls. For this purpose, AW's die rolls can replace D&amp;D's. <br/><br/>Is that correct? To me, it seems that AW rolls can replace strategic thinking. (No figuring out how important it is to hunt for an exit; just roll to know where it is!) But if you simply refuse to use them that way, then hey, rock on. I dunno if the game is helping you face challenges, but it sure isn't stopping you. I would miss my toolkit of D&amp;D spells, though.<br/></blockquote>\nHere's another one, much more recently:\n<blockquote><br/>I think I'm in the same boat as Paul. No one needs to explain to me how an "engine" of "2d6 for good/mixed/bad + some sort of GM principles" could possibly be used for tackling challenges. And no one needs to debate whether Apocalypse World istelf, as written, is particularly good for that -- it's not.<br/><br/>I think the interesting question is what the "engine" gets you for challenge-based play. If the answer is "a prompt to design your own moves and principles which are what actually support challenge-based play" then that's fine, but I can't tell if that's what people are saying or not.<br/><br/>The set of principles that work for both AW and for challenge play -- are those declared to be part of the "engine" too? If so, cool, but which ones are those, exactly?<br/><br/>"Interrogate the fiction", for example, could be seen as an MC principle, a rationale behind how to design good moves, a social contract matter, or just a habit from every trad game that ever forced you to do that to get anywhere.<br/></blockquote>\nSo, I'm willing to accept that I'm just thick and not getting it. But if that's the case, I'm in at least somewhat good company. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Given people's accounts of these games (and particularly with you three, John, Jonathan, and Johnstone), it sounds like there's some good magic at work, and people are having a great time. However, in these discussions it often feels like your advice is just, "Hey, go with the flow and it works great!" (I'm exaggerating, of course.) That obviously isn't working for everyone.<br/><br/>I'd like to get deeper into what exactly makes it work, if you're game. Is it a question of playing differently, or just having slightly different tastes/interests?

For that very reason, I encourage you very much to stay in the conversation! It's great to have you here. Sometimes the "Cool Kids" get their way in all debates, and it seems like dissenting voices are encouraged to keep their noses out of it. (I don't think it's intentional, it's just emergent human behaviour.)<br/><br/>You're portraying yourself as a bit of a curmudgeon -- is that just humour, or are you one of the "old guard", who played D&amp;D way back when, in the mists of time?<br/><br/>(By the way, for what it's worth, I'm not particularly old -- I'm 30 -- but I've stayed well away from modern versions of D&amp;D, so that's not a point of comparison for me: "attacks of swapportunity and 4.75 feet steps and f33tz" is all pretty foreign technology to me, and not terribly appealing.)<br/><br/>As for the falling off the cliff, pure GM judgement is a good option, sure. But it means your game is only ever as good as your GM. I firmly believe that good GMs do stuff which can be replicated and taught. That's one of the things I'm trying to get out of this thread. (For instance, in Eero's D&amp;D threads, he describes how the group tends to negotiate fair resolutions together, and then apply them mercilessly, which everyone seems to enjoy. That's a great technique! John Harper's "keep asking questions about the fiction until it becomes clear" is another great technique for the same thing. I feel that the former is more robust in a competitive environment than the latter, because human beings trying to "win" find it easier to agree on probabilities than outcomes, but they're both great tools in lots of various situations.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419493/#Comment_419493" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-02T19:22:14+00:00" title="August  2, 2013  7:22PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/akooser">@akooser</a>, thanks!

I'm mostly watching this thread because you're using me as a stalking horse of some sort. (Not that I mind being your old school D&amp;D example case, if you think that's useful.)<br/><br/>To me it seems that the Apocalypse World orthodoxy knows what they're talking about - several of these people know quite well how gamist games run, either from successfully implemented D&amp;D or various weird Forgean side-paths over the years; if they say that the AW rules can be repurposed for that, I for one don't doubt them. No idea if it's as good as the D&amp;D mechanical framework, but that level of comparison is probably meaningless when we're talking about heavily house-ruling and adapting a game for something that is not its intended purpose.<br/><br/>A word regarding conflict vs. task resolution, though: the fact that AW moves are largely used for conflict resolution (not always - it's the same as TSoY ability checks) doesn't necessarily make gamism impossible. You don't need to have task resolution and a tight organic conflict resolution loop like D&amp;D does it for the game to be successful in addressing challenges. In fact, even in D&amp;D it's perfectly reasonable in some situations to streamline into conflict-resolution territory.<br/><br/>If we're playing a D&amp;D-like game where e.g. combats are resolved in an abstracted manner - with a single 50/50 dice roll per participant to see if they're fine or injured after the fight, say - this doesn't mean that there is no challenge, it just means that the challenge is in managing the exterior conditions and consequences of the choice to fight: which fights do we engage in, what are the consequences of winning and losing, and so on. It could be as simple as playing <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15512/diamant" rel="nofollow">Diamant</a> (a simple boardgame - look it up, it's quite instructive), in fact, with the players merely choosing after each fight whether to press on or retreat. In this sort of game the gamble is a major element of excitement, but it's still a challenge - a challenge of nerves and sense of proportion, so that you'll take the risks that are needed, and take any setbacks in good grace.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419507/#Comment_419507" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-03T04:39:03+00:00" title="August  3, 2013  4:39AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 3, 2013 6:19AM by Johnstone.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, no worries.<br/><br/>All I'm doing is relating my experience of a thing I did, not trying to lay down some absolute truth or anything. I mean, I can't be wrong -- I did it, it's done -- so there's no argument. But that doesn't mean what I did will work for anyone else, or even that I'll be able to explain it properly, since stuff I take for granted might be a big deal to someone else. And what constitutes "using AW" vs. "using pieces from AW" is going to differ between people, and I might not even be addressing your initial question in some opinions. So I don't mind being challenged on stuff. Like, I'll back up my opinion with reasons and whatnot, but that's an explanation. It's just my perspective and I'm just some guy. I don't feel like a cool kid or even a "fan," really, I just hack AW a lot, is all. So I have experience and opinions other people may be able to use.<br/><br/>Okay, back to game design. In a whisper, you asked me:<br/><br/>"Is your question about the cliff serious or rhetorical? The cliff is there as a tactical feature, or because it makes sense fictionally, or, ideally, both."<br/><br/>So, yeah, serious, for sure! In terms of how prominent the cliff becomes in my decision-making, it kind of breaks down into two categories: Is the cliff there because I think it looks cool? Or did I introduce it as an explicit challenge to the players?<br/><br/>Really: When you decided "there's a cliff," why? Why a <i>cliff</i>? What's it for?<br/>"Cliffs look cool."<br/>"Because I want to connect these two caves but I don't want it to be too easy to go back and forth."<br/>"Because I want to call the adventure <i>The Cliffs of Doom</i>, so I need to have a cliff in it."<br/>"So characters can fall off it."<br/><br/>That last one is different. If I say up front "there is a cliff here, you could fall off if you fight here," then the space between stepping up to fight and falling off the cliff is pretty short. Like if you are at the edge of the cliff, you miss a roll, and there is an enemy right there who (when I think about his perspective) wants to push you off the cliff? Then probably you get pushed off the cliff.<br/><br/>But if I'm like "yeah, there's a cliff, it looks really cool," then it's not an explicit challenge and it's (probably) not fair to throw a PC off it until either I or the players make an issue out of it. Like, the fight starts to go badly and I step up and say "okay, the orc raider's eyes dart between you and the edge of the cliff, he grins and starts to come at you." Now I have signalled that falling off the cliff is a potential danger. The player can decide what to do about it at that point -- too risky? Run away? Trust their fighting abilities? Or if one of the players decides to throw an enemy off the cliff. It they end up struggling at the edge, it is fair for the plan to backfire and for the PC to go over the cliff instead. But if it's not a explicit threat, then the space between stepping up to fight and going over the cliff has to include that moment where it does become and explicit threat.<br/><br/>(And if it's just "fictionally appropriate" then I guess it's kind of a byproduct of a bunch of other decisions, right? So it might as well be the same as "it looks cool," until the GM calls it out as a threat.)<br/><br/>But even this is just some of what goes into the decision. This cliff-side fight is still embedded in a great deal of context. There's a whole game going on here! So, like:<br/>- What did you (ie the GM) say when you pitched the game to the players?<br/>- What expectations did character creation set?<br/>- What has the game been like up to this point?<br/>- What were the expectations going into the fight?<br/><br/>So basically, what are the expectations of the group as a whole, based on everything that came before? That's one of the main decision-making factors. You need to play to those expectations for everything important in rpgs, really, right? So if challenge is important, the whole group has to be on the same page. Even if you (the GM) are teaching the players how dangerous the game is by killing their characters a lot, they still have to have accepted the expectation that they will "learn the game by failing."<br/><br/>In normal AW, how do you set the group's expectations regarding tone and what kind of apocalyptica players get to narrate? Like when you want a gritty game, or a gonzo mutant animal game, or an action movie game? When it's your turn to introduce something into the setting, you have to gauge expectations and the mood of the group -- do those same considerations not work when you think about managing challenges, obstacles, and threats? And if not, what more do you think you need to feel comfortable in that position?<br/><br/><br/>It's possible this may be a different answer from "it depends on the fiction," and really it depends on more than that. Adam said at the top of the thread:\n<blockquote>The MC has no real limits on how hard he can hit the PCs. In Gamist mode, I'd think everyone would have to agree on some limits for creating challenges or the victories would be meaningless (and basically GM fiat). </blockquote>\nYeah, I think that's true. You have to set expectations about the aspect of challenges in the game if it's going to be important. But you still have to set expectations if you're not playing in that mode, the agenda and principles just say to make it feel real, interesting, and that things follow from the fiction. But whether or not you can have mutant clowns or aliens or rapists as a threat depends on the expectations of the group, yeah?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419509/#Comment_419509" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-03T07:13:38+00:00" title="August  3, 2013  7:13AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 4, 2013 4:45AM by Johnstone.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Here's what Johnstone's account sounds like, to me: in old school D&amp;D, a lot of the techniques for challenge-based play have zero to do with formal rules, and everything to do with a direct GM-player interaction which rewards cleverness and punishes strategic failures. When the players opt to take a risk, or when they screw up and get in trouble, then some of what ensues is randomized with die rolls. For this purpose, AW's die rolls can replace D&amp;D's. <br/><br/>Is that correct? To me, it seems that AW rolls can replace strategic thinking. (No figuring out how important it is to hunt for an exit; just roll to know where it is!) But if you simply refuse to use them that way, then hey, rock on. I dunno if the game is helping you face challenges, but it sure isn't stopping you. I would miss my toolkit of D&amp;D spells, though.<br/></blockquote>\nYeah, that sounds like a part of it, though maybe not the whole thing? I can try to outline the various arenas of decision-making, and either you or the original author can ask for more clarification. I tried to address how strategy can interact with the moves above when I was talking about difficulty modifiers, but if that wasn't good enough or doesn't quite hit the issue, and what I writ below doesn't do it either, we can go back to it.<br/><br/>When I'm dealing with challenges, as a player, these are some of the ways I go about strategizing:<br/><br/>1. Knowing the GM (DM), understanding the way they think, reading their body language, stuff like that. They are trying to communicate certain information about the game, but their effectiveness at doing that can vary, and they are inevitable communicating certain other information, which you can also pick up on. This might get derided as meta-gaming and all, but it's still a thing.<br/><br/>2. Reading the map. If we've done some exploration already, we've got an incomplete map with features on it and blank spaces. So I look at the map and try to figure out where the secret rooms are, or where links between certain areas might be. I'm also looking for the most effective route to get to where we want to go (where the treasure is), so we can get in and out with the loot while facing a minimum of hassle.<br/><br/>2a. Experience with the "actual" environment depicted by the map. Once you've been exploring a place, you get a sense of what the rules are that govern it, like random monster checks, you learn how difficult the difficult passages are (climbing down caves, fording underground rivers, etc). So along with mapping comes other information that you can use to determine exploration strategies.<br/><br/>3. Knowing the rules. So like, what <i>are</i> the rules for finding secret doors? Do we just find them when we look for them, Old School primer style? Do we use the Moldvay rules (1 in 6 chance), and if we do do we only get one roll per character or do we get to keep trying every 10 minutes? Do we get to see the die roll or is it secretly rolled by the DM? Do we use the discern realities move from DW? Knowing how the rules work allows you to judge their effectiveness in any particular situation.<br/><br/>For example, let's say I've studied the map and there's a suspicious blank spot. Knowing the DM, he's the kind of guy to fill up the whole piece of graph paper, plus there's lots of wizards around here but no wizard's lab. So we want to go check for secret doors. We mark out all the places we think we should check, then we organize our expedition(s) in a way that makes the most advantage of the secret door rules. Maybe we get one character who is really good at it (they have high WIS, they're an elven thief) bodyguard them down to a specific spot and have them search. Maybe we grab a whole shitload of mooks and have them all search (the more d6s being rolled, the more chance of a 1 coming up, and mooks are expendable if we run into trouble).<br/><br/>But I wouldn't necessarily say that the randomness is only engaged when the players take risks or when they screw up. I think the idea of players desperately trying to avoid dice is a bit overblown (although I'm sure it probably happens). In my experience, dice rolling is inevitable, so you want to manage those rules so they work to your advantage as much as possible (unless you get a rush out of reckless gambling, which is also legit, but usually results in more character death).<br/><br/>4. Character resources and tools. So we have a range of fictional and mechanical resources specific to our characters -- like hit points, iron spikes, and spells. These can be unique to specific characters or lacking in some characters. Not everyone has high HP. Not everyone carries the same gear. Only some characters have spells (and I actually did put spells into World of Algol, too).<br/><br/>Using these can sometimes include player cleverness. Find Object (the spell) points you in the direction of the nearest object you want to find, and lasts for a while so you can walk around. It doesn't say you can triangulate roughly where objects are by moving around but it wasn't too hard to convince my DM that I could do this, because it's pretty reasonable. So we pick a spot and my magic-user walks around looking for gold, and we get some leads on where gold is hidden. Or there's the time the witch turned invisible in order to shove a shrinking potion down the minotaur's throat so she could take the magic amulet off his neck.<br/><br/>And sometimes it's risk assessment, both mechanical and fictional. The guys with high hit points and low armour class take the lead. The magic-user is guarded by the fighters. Do we leave the rope here so we can climb up and down, or do we take it with us because we still need it and somebody is just going to steal it? Which doors do we spike shut, if we only have three spikes left?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419510/#Comment_419510" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-03T07:13:45+00:00" title="August  3, 2013  7:13AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 4, 2013 4:45AM by Johnstone.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, second part: Can the AW moves replace strategic thinking? How, why, etc.<br/><br/>Hmm. I think the example of "you just roll and get the info" is an easy one to go to, but I don't really feel like that's how it works in practice. I found that read a sitch and read a person were a little better than a 1-in-6 chance to find secret doors, but not overwhelmingly so. I could see open your brain turning into a move that bypasses strategy by letting the player demand useful info from the GM, although this never ended up happening in my game. The players still had to judge the map first, advocate for their fictional position second, and choose their moves third. Or that's how it seemed to me. The search move I have in World of Algol now is supposed to function more or less the way we use the D&amp;D search rules -- the dice determine if you find anything but only in the place you chose to search, so choose wisely.<br/><br/>So, in terms of info-gathering moves and PC-action moves (combat, persuasion, whatever), yeah, I think the AW moves can just replace the D&amp;D moves, and it works out fine, for the most part, at least when group expectations have been set properly. I dunno how different my game was from what John, Jonathan, and Ara have played, though, since I wasn't using World of Dungeons.<br/><br/>There IS an issue with moves that allow players to create things, though. D&amp;D gives players rules for manipulating what fiction already exists (through their characters taking action) and for obtaining more information about it (search for hidden doors rules, etc), but nothing for creating and inserting concrete elements aside from introducing a character, with a name and a description.<br/><br/>In one game of World of Algol, a village wanted to hire the two PCs (a bard and a shereshi). The bard had the move that lets him say he has been here before and that he left something behind. So he immediately takes advantage of this by saying that he left a bunch of valuables here for safekeeping and wants them back. I was kind of like "dude, this is the only dungeon I brought, you still have to do it," but that's an example of using narrative authority to erase certain challenges introduced by the GM or the game.<br/><br/>Dunno if that answers any questions, hopefully it explains what I was doing more clearly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419517/#Comment_419517" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-03T14:24:36+00:00" title="August  3, 2013  2:24PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Hey Paul:</b> I am 100% interested in really digging into these issues and helping people understand (because I care about that stuff) and 0% interested in any of this "Cool Kid" stuff.

This is all absolutely fascinating (and immediately relevant) to me, both as a gamer-player and as a game designer. I don't particularly care about the "Cool Kid" stuff, either (it's unavoidable to a large extent). The only way it's really even relevant here is the thing that Dave points out: there's a sense that asking questions about anything that's against the "status quo" (whatever that may be at a given time) requires an incredible amount of pushing and repeating yourself. Sometimes when people -- myself or others -- bring up a question like this, I get a vibe (just a little bit) that the person posting is being taken as someone who doesn't know what he's talking about, by default. So if you can do something about that, I urge you to consider it. If not, no biggie: all of you are people who are consistently cool, helpful, and full of interesting things to say, which is why I'm here in the first place. So that's 90% of the battle, good enough!<br/><br/>As for discussing the actual mechanics of how this works in the game, those last two posts by Johnstone are <i>gold</i>! That's exactly the kind of stuff I was hoping to hear. I'll be going back to reread those when I come back to this thread tomorrow, because there's a lot in there.<br/><br/>Here's what I said way back when:\n<blockquote>Guys, this discussion is really great so far, but I was really hoping for a little more of:<br/><br/>"Yes, I've done it and here's how it went. Here's what worked and here's what didn't."<br/><br/>Those of you who have played World of Dungeons in this mode, how did it go? You know, in actual play, not in theory.</blockquote>\nSo hearing what kinds of challenges were present, and how players navigated them in play, and how the GM/MC can better adjust her Principles to make judgement calls, that's what I'd like to get into here. <br/><br/>For instance, with the whole "how do you make a hard move when someone could fall of a cliff" dilemma, Johnstone posits that his approach is to establish a reliable metric among the group and stick to consistency as much as possible. That's one possible solution, and it sounds like a good one. Are there others?<br/><br/>Assuming a group already very familiar with AW/WoDu, what advice would you give to help them move the game in the direction of competitive, Gamist play, similar to [a certain type of] old-school D&amp;D?<br/><br/>I've already received some great answers, so for me this thread has been very successful so far.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul" title="Irminsul"><img alt="Irminsul" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul">Irminsul</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419524/#Comment_419524" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-03T19:28:29+00:00" title="August  3, 2013  7:28PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 3, 2013 7:28PM by Irminsul.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, I'm sad.

The prep is written in stone and there's a timetable of events.  The intersection of that timetable with the players' moves is the lion's share of the fiction.

And at the end of the session I share all the prepared materials with the players so they can appreciate the narrow paths they carve through the scenario.<br/><br/>Paul, if you want to see how I set this up, check out my Regiment scenario: <a href="http://john.aegard.com/mission-boston-v0.3.zip" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://john.aegard.com/mission-boston-v0.3.zip</a><br/><br/>I definitely found a player gradient with that scenario.  I played it with two different groups at GPNW.  Both groups recorded significant achievements. However, one was gonzo and entertaining, playing the game like a Sgt Rock comic.  They had one survivor out of a squad of fifteen and that survivor was a POW who got captured while freelancing.  The other group was methodical, thoughtful, team-driven.  They made plans and gathered resources, set up covering fire, manoeuvred as a team.  Seven out of fifteen survived, none were captured.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419546/#Comment_419546" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-04T09:04:50+00:00" title="August  4, 2013  9:04AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Regiment is a great example for this thread!

I've run six(?) sessions of WoD in the style we're discussing (not 100 or whatever) and I haven't faced the exact sorts of situations that are being discussed.  But I do have some basic grounding from experience on the topic.  And I started playing BD&amp;D in 1980 so I feel like I have some exposure to how things happened at that time, in case that helps.\n<blockquote>Great! I agree with that first part. Danger established, fictionally logical, then a missed roll. Totally legit to make the guy fall off the cliff. But... would you have them fall off every time? I mean, that would get boring. So sometimes you might make a different move, instead, right? <br/><br/>Let's say you had three people fighting in the same situation, all were aware that they were in danger of falling off the cliff. All three miss a roll in a fight with some bad guys. It's your turn to make an MC move. Do all three fall, or do they get different outcomes?</blockquote>\nThe three party members are backed up against the cliff and fighting eight orcs?  The orcs are leering and jabbing at them with spears, encouraging them to fall off?  And all three PCs botch their attacks?  Sure, hell yeah, they're all three falling.  I have no problem with that.  I don't mind that kind of "boring".  But, if based on the fiction of what they're doing and what the orcs are doing and what we've said about the cliff, there's some more natural terrible failure to come out of it, I'd go with that.<br/><br/>That said, if The Hungry Chasm was part of my prep then I'd turn to the move I made up for this.  Maybe, <i>when you first <b>fight at the cliff-edge of The Hungry Chasm</b>, roll+dex.  On a 12+, hold 4, on a 10-11, hold 2 and on a 7-9, hold 1.  Spend those hold any time the GM tells you you've fallen off the cliff to explain how you prevent the fall, or to hurl an enemy over the edge.</i><br/><br/>And if it wasn't, but when it became clear that it was going to be a Big Thing, I'd start to worry about how to make principled decisions -- just along the lines you're saying.  So I'd remember AW MC principles and I'd disclaim decision-making and create a countdown clock for any PCs fighting at the edge of the cliff.  Maybe as just a simple pacing mechanism: having them fill in a wedge each time I <i>could</i> throw them off but don't actually do it until their clock is full -- shit, they've had all kinds of forewarning at that point; I feel no guilt if they couldn't manage to get off the cliff by then.  Or maybe I take a minute or two to write up a proper prescriptive/descriptive countdown clock and use that, adjusting it as the fiction demands, but at least there's this indicator we're all looking at.\n<blockquote>You're changing the consequences of failure in response to a different approach to a challenge, and that's a solid technique.

Yikes.<br/><br/>My original thoughts were about Apocalypse World, which I have played a dozen sessions or so, and run a half dozen sessions. I have played Dungeon World once in a con setting. I have run Monsterhearts for two sessions now. I can't make any real claims about how D*W plays compared to D&amp;D; I just don't have any enough experience with it from the GM side. I feel mostly qualified to make claims about MCing A*W. I've played just about every version of D&amp;D ever, a lot.<br/><br/>I feel like the improvisational nature of A*W leads to a lot of GM fiat and makes it impossible to be as impartial as a D&amp;D DM must be in a challenge-based game. <br/><br/>It's not kosher for a DM to adjust encounters on the fly in a challenge-based game, and the rules specifically outline how to build encounters in the 4E rules. In earlier editions, there are plenty of cases where a dungeon includes encounters a party can't handle, but the DM is expected to give players a chance to discover this before they go in (listening at doors, other recon, etc.) and the "run away" rules pretty explicitly give people a fair chance to get away, independent of encounter level (it's a flat chance in 6 that a monster will stop to pick up treasure or food).<br/><br/>You <i>could</i> prep A*W like a dungeon, listing out every encounter and the types of damage they do, but doesn't that go against the grain of the RAW?<br/><br/>Now maybe that's how you're supposed to play D*W and WoD. No clue. I'm just talking specifically about A*W, as written. <br/><br/>I'm not saying that you can't use the *W chassis to build a Gamist system, cuz that'd be a silly claim. You can use any game's chassis to build any kind of game.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419593/#Comment_419593" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-05T12:58:22+00:00" title="August  5, 2013 12:58PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2013 12:59PM by Paul_T.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christopher,<br/><br/>I like your notes on "disclaiming responsibility" by making your thought process less opaque: that's what countdown clocks and similar do -- they get us all to buy in to what's a possible threat and when it might happen.

I would do things like, "Listen, you know the guy's got a gun in your face, right, and that it could go off at any time?" "Yeah, I'm just hoping I'm faster than him!" But not, "Ok, if you miss on this move, I'm either going to separate you or inflict harm to this NPC, but I won't deal harm." I feel that oversteps the "address the characters, not the players" Principle of AW.<br/><br/>In other words, fictional threats are fully disclosed and discussed, but I've never seen anyone drop out of character and discuss what kinds of hard moves the MC might or might not make prior to deciding whether to roll or not. I guess we see that as a feature: if you do it, do it, and make with the dice.

That's a solid point.<br/><br/><i>Crosspost edit:</i> I disagree with John a bit. There's a bunch of mechanisms you can optionally use, but the way I read those pages, the essential spirit of an NPC taking 2-harm is "hey, it's up to you dawg, you the MC!" and not "X is what always happens."

But I consider that stuff there so that a) the MC doesn't have to prep before the 1st session and b) so that the PCs can live in a world that is familiar to them (and I guess c) so that when the MC does do prep, it's guaranteed to be stuff the players have decided they are interested in). When I make a dungeon I'm prepping an unfamiliar location, so that stuff isn't necessary.

How are you adjudicating the challenges that those fronts present to the PCs?</blockquote>\nHmmm. I'm not sure I understand the question, but I'll try. I prepare the Fronts by the book, and I think of stuff that's thematically interesting, and is suited to the characters. What I mean by "suited to the characters" is that it seems like it will be interesting to seem them struggle with it. Sometimes that means it fits well with their strengths (for example, the Gunlugger has a sniper rifle, so I realized throwing some guys with a mortar lobbing grenades at the holding from a distance might be interesting: will he help defend it against them?). Sometimes it means it's not in line with the characters' strengths (as another example, my Hardholder has Weird-2, and is terrified of the maelstrom, so I came up with some weird spies/infiltrators trying to bring down the hold who appear to have come back from the dead and hear voices in their heads).<br/><br/>I'd say that in a dungeon crawl, there's more room for the players to choose their battles. I offer them some options; they decide what to pursue. While that's true in AW, it's less so: the Fronts and threats are largely things that are *coming after the PCs*, whether they like it or not.<br/><br/>In play, I adjudicate outcomes often with an eye towards *what would be more interesting*. If an important NPC and some person we don't really know are hiding behind a thin wall, and the Gunlugger opens fire on the area, I might be more likely to have the nameless person die and the important NPC survive, for example. I probably wouldn't have a PC fall off a cliff in a fight: it's more interesting to leave them dangling from their fingertips, so they have to bargain with their would-be killer. <br/><br/>Resolutions which complicate situations, escalate conflicts, and raise the stakes are more attractive than resolutions which settles those situations or conflicts for good. If it's equally believable that the brute slaver would capture the PC's lover (as opposed to killing her), I'll probably choose that more often. A nuclear bomb exploding in the holding would be more likely to go off while they were away on patrol than while they were sleeping. ("Okay, you retire for the night. Sorry to say, no one wakes up. You all take 20-harm in your sleep...")<br/><br/>The obstacles or threats would only be insurmountable (well beyond the power of the PCs) if that was a) the only way it was believable/consistent with what we've narrated so far, or b) having an insurmountable threat of that type was thematically interesting.<br/><br/>We also play with a keen eye on the consistency and the believability of the world we're establishing, though; once something has been created/introduced, it's there to stay. Now it's my job as the MC to present it believably and consistently. (So if that same brute slaver is known as a sick fuck who kills anyone he captures, never taking prisoners, then that PC's lover won't be left alive after all. But if he was a brand new NPC we didn't know anything about, I'd consider having him fall in love with her instead. Or I might ask the players: "What do you think Balls would do here? Would he like her? Would he kill her?" All the usual AW principles apply here.)<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419606/#Comment_419606" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-05T15:31:03+00:00" title="August  5, 2013  3:31PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regardless of how exactly one is supposed to interpret the rules where "kill stuff you own" and "1 Harm does cosmetic damage to NPCs" intersect, I think "look through crosshairs" is a good example of a principle that's great for AW and irrelevant or bad for challenge-based play.<br/><br/>At challenge time, the stuff you want to attack is the PCs' resources, but you don't want to just destroy them.  Killing a useful NPC because "you own it" is playing wrong and is bad for the game.  Killing a non-useful NPC for whatever reason is irrelevant and is a waste of your GM efforts.<br/><br/>"Look through a lens of utility" might be a good principle here.  You can do whatever you want with the mayor... unless he owes the PCs a favor.  If he owes them a favor, you don't take that away; you set up a <i>threat</i> to take it away, and you challenge the PCs to <i>stop</i> the threat.  (This is philosophically similar to Burning Wheel's "let it ride", which is often used to mean "once the players earn something, it stays earned until separate outcomes dictate otherwise").<br/><br/>The difference here is subtle: AW advises you to threaten stuff the PCs value too, but it isn't concerned with the challenge-relevant details of when/how/why.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419607/#Comment_419607" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-05T16:18:50+00:00" title="August  5, 2013  4:18PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2013 4:19PM by John_Harper.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is very subtle, David, and I think I agree with you. Especially your last paragraph.<br/><br/>Still, in AW, it's gonna look (exactly?) the same. I "look through crosshairs" but also, especially, "make a move that follows from the fiction." So, when I go to destroy the mayor, I first set up a threat against him, bring it to life in the shared fiction, then follow through as circumstances dictate.<br/><br/>I don't say, "Oh, you know the mayor? He died." (obviously). That's not MCing (or, if it is, it's a very shitty version).<br/><br/>The difference, as you say, is in why the mayor exists and why he's threatened. It's not all created as a set piece challenge for the PCs to overcome. It happens as a result of principles designed to create an ongoing apocalypse world that's tearing itself apart. Everyone is a threat, including the mayor! Sure, he might be a resource, but he's also a host of problems and dangers. His destruction might be good for them! The MC doesn't care. It's more important to "run the apocalypse" so that the world continues to break down and die.<br/><br/>From the player side of things, though, it looks an awful lot like challenge-based play, in my experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419608/#Comment_419608" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-05T16:44:38+00:00" title="August  5, 2013  4:44PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>In play, I adjudicate outcomes often with an eye towards *what would be more interesting*. If an important NPC and some person we don't really know are hiding behind a thin wall, and the Gunlugger opens fire on the area, I might be more likely to have the nameless person die and the important NPC survive, for example. I probably wouldn't have a PC fall off a cliff in a fight: it's more interesting to leave them dangling from their fingertips, so they have to bargain with their would-be killer. <br/><br/>Resolutions which complicate situations, escalate conflicts, and raise the stakes are more attractive than resolutions which settles those situations or conflicts for good. If it's equally believable that the brute slaver would capture the PC's lover (as opposed to killing her), I'll probably choose that more often. A nuclear bomb exploding in the holding would be more likely to go off while they were away on patrol than while they were sleeping. ("Okay, you retire for the night. Sorry to say, no one wakes up. You all take 20-harm in your sleep...")<br/><br/>The obstacles or threats would only be insurmountable (well beyond the power of the PCs) if that was a) the only way it was believable/consistent with what we've narrated so far, or b) having an insurmountable threat of that type was thematically interesting.<br/><br/>We also play with a keen eye on the consistency and the believability of the world we're establishing, though; once something has been created/introduced, it's there to stay. Now it's my job as the MC to present it believably and consistently. (So if that same brute slaver is known as a sick fuck who kills anyone he captures, never taking prisoners, then that PC's lover won't be left alive after all. But if he was a brand new NPC we didn't know anything about, I'd consider having him fall in love with her instead.<br/></blockquote>\nSo this looks a lot like the way I ran World of Algol. Yeah, as you point out, fronts go after the PCs and dungeons don't, but otherwise, this seems pretty familiar to me and doesn't seem incompatible with what I've related so far.<br/><br/>I ask because I don't really see that much difference between the threats in the dungeon and the threats to the PCs' community from fronts. Now, granted, the actual challenge-y bit of the game isn't really a major priority for me, but regardless of that, I wonder if you can't take the way you run those and apply that to running dungeons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419611/#Comment_419611" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-05T17:40:05+00:00" title="August  5, 2013  5:40PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>From the player side of things, though, it looks an awful lot like challenge-based play, in my experience.</blockquote>In terms of "here are the facts of a fictional situation", sure.

What I see as different is how I, as MC, adjudicate outcomes in play. In AW, I might "put my bloody fingerprints on everything and respond with intermittent fuckery, sometimes" (or whatever the quote is) and "sometimes give them exactly what they want". I want things to be unpredictable, chaotic, full of meaning and drama. In a challenge-based adventure, I'd need to try to adjudicate outcomes as closely as possible to the performance of the players: they make a smart plan, they get the goods. They screw up, they get screwed. Does that make sense? That's the part I find the AW rules to be a difficult fit for, but I'm seeing more and more interesting ways to apply it as a result of this thread, so let's keep going with this!<br/><br/>One thing I'd love to hear about (from ANYONE reading):<br/><br/>If you've run/played World of Dungeons, with its one basic move, did you find yourselves settling into certain "conventional" uses of the move in certain situations? I would imagine some baseline expectations would be built up over time: "in this kind of situation, we always roll at this time, and these are the typical consequences".

If you're not into it, no sweat.  I just think maybe, if we could identify some keys to our different experiences, that might be germane to this thread.  "How much variety in focus?" might be one key; I'm not sure.)<br/><br/>"Self-centered hedonist characters vs sensible tactician characters" strikes me as part of the equation, but probably not the most important part.  My AW Hocus was absolutely a schemer, by far the most strategic member of our cast, and I had plenty of fun coming up with goals to better the fortunes of my followers, and to bulwark my status from challenges.  But I never once used the strategic part of my brain that I use when I play OD&amp;D-type stuff.  This is partly because my group wouldn't support that socially (although why would they? AW doesn't prime them to), and partly because the AW system gives me so little bang for my strategic buck.<br/><br/><b>In my OD&amp;D play</b>, if I set fire to a ceiling support, and I am standing a ways from the exit, then we'll precisely determine whether I have time to escape, and if not, I'm dead.  No roll.  "The ceiling definitely fell before you could make it to the door, so you are definitely dead."  <br/><br/>Because I have learned this, I <b>always think</b> about things like exit distances.<br/><br/><b>In my AW play</b>, if I set fire to a ceiling support, and I am standing a ways from the exit, then we'll just roll to act under fire.  We won't bother to establish the exact details first, because they won't impact the number rolled.  If the roll goes badly, then maybe the MC can trap me or take my stuff or inflict harm "as established" (whatever that means here); but the roll will likely go well because I've got (on average) +1 Cool so I just need to roll a 6 on 2d6.  After the roll, we establish the particulars of what has happened.  <br/><br/>Because I have learned this, I <b>never think</b> about things like exit distances.<br/><br/>Let's say I pick up my dice to roll Act Under Fire, and you're the MC.  Imagine saying this to me: <span style="color: #003396;">"Wait!  Didn't you say you were by the statue?  And didn't we establish the statue is 40 feet from the door?  And didn't we establish that your napalm ignition takes exactly 2 seconds and packs more explosive punch than this ceiling can handle?  Well, 40 feet in 2 seconds is beyond human running speed.  So, don't roll.  You're crushed by the falling roof.  That would seem to be 4 Harm."</span>  Would you do that?  Would you expect it to fly?  If I did that, I'd expect to be told that I was playing wrong.  My players are most definitely not playing AW to have to worry about exit distances.<br/><br/>(If "exit distances" seems silly or boring, just replace it with any sort of logistics that one might game for advantage or suffer from overlooking.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/semiomant" title="semiomant"><img alt="semiomant" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/semiomant">semiomant</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419628/#Comment_419628" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-06T02:52:59+00:00" title="August  6, 2013  2:52AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would certainly expect that with all the framing you mentioned, it should be possible to just declare the character dead, no roll required. When the previous conversation established a fictional position where setting fire is mortally stupid, and then you let players off the hook by making a roll that is favorable to them ...<br/>that is certainly acceptable if there is a greater expectation that wasn't mentioned, like "Characters can do crazy things and live".  In my first sentence otoh, a different assumption "about the worldliness of the word" is contained: "if you do crazy stupid things you will die".<br/><br/>if the player then says:"wait. i can always make a roll/move" they are gaming the system to get their way. This "gaming the system" to get an advantage over other participants is what I see as gameism.<br/><br/>The decision does not need to be made beforehand. If a player formulates the "burn down the ceiling" there will be plenty of time for cues and talk to find out which assumption you want to apply, and if it will be important to worry about distances. In practical GMing i prefer compromise, so I will allow the player to roll, but with a penalty. For some reason that gives the player a better feeling while minimizing the undermining of the principles in my GMing.<br/><br/>i guess the upshot of this is that if you manage to define the right set of principles, you can use the play style you want, whether it's your (or mine) understanding and definition of gameism or "story-gaming". i think "system matters", so in some cases you need a lot more work and principles of framing and interpretation to go against the grain of the rules material, but there is probably no reason you cannot do it if you are invested enough.

It's a word that means, to put it simply, that the given instance of play is concerned with determining, facing and struggling with a challenge, perhaps triumphing against it. This could be against other players, using the rules as a tool, yes - but it might as well not be.<br/><br/>The more you know, and all that.

Thanks! And I agree.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/semiomant">@semiomant</a>,\n<blockquote><br/>that is certainly acceptable if there is a greater expectation that wasn't mentioned, like "Characters can do crazy things and live". </blockquote>\nI've always gotten the distinct impression that AW is precisely about that! (Not only stylistically: e.g. Mad Max, etc -- but baked into so many aspects of the system, like the extra hit points which mean you can "take a bullet for free" and shrug it off, as well as the "free come back from death" rule via the ability to take Debilities to survive any possible source of death.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/John">@John</a> Harper,<br/><br/>Well, Dave already said it better than me, but in a hardcore "challenge-based" game style I could certainly have a character who has some quirks or some unusual hedonistic interests... the difference is that, if the group (i.e. whoever's on my side, depending on the exact game's setup) needed my cooperation in carrying out a plan, I'd be a jerk if I didn't play along. My character's interests might come up because I grumble about not getting what I want, but they wouldn't become a focal point.<br/><br/>In AW, I'd expect the opposite. It'd be a weird disconnect if someone's character just gave up on whoever/whatever they loved or cared for just to assist some other characters in defeating a challenge. And I don't particularly want to play AW with someone who answers "Nothing!" to questions of, "What do you care about? Who's important to you? What do you fear?"<br/><br/>I think we understand each other here: I'm just commenting in case we're not on the same page somehow.<br/><br/>Now, when it comes to WoDu:\n<blockquote><br/>Just like basic moves in any AW-style game. Based on the type of stuff we built up in play. Like our quicksilver addiction clock and our "fortunes on the guild" move (scavenged from ACKS), and also Hack-and-Slash, Last Breath, and Read a Sitch, used as is. Plus plenty of others.<br/><br/>Some people call these judgment calls and house rules. Same thing.</blockquote>\nOh, right! What I meant was:<br/><br/>"In <i>your</i> WoDu play, which <i>specific</i> basic moves did you find yourselves gravitating towards?"<br/><br/>I'd imagine that we might find some good grist for the mill by looking into this. Which things were consistently rolled for, which weren't... isn't that kind of what makes AW-based systems tick?<br/><br/>I find it particularly interesting that you used Read a Sitch in your game! I know a lot of people would argue that the move has no place in a Gamist interpretation of the game. But I actually disagree: I think it can totally work. (But I'm very open to having my opinion changed on this.)<br/><br/>Thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419631/#Comment_419631" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-06T05:42:09+00:00" title="August  6, 2013  5:42AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, that example you give of "playing wrong"?  My group plays that way sometimes.  And we have fun.  And <i>if</i> we established all those facts (we normally wouldn't, but maybe -- because that's the flip side of interrogating the fiction; establishing it minutely) and you painted yourself into a corner and did something suicidal, then I'd just assign you harm and that's that.  And even if I dropped six harm on you, there are debilities; you'd be fine.  (I mean, a scarred wreck, sure, but it's all good.)<br/><br/>And to be clear, other times we just ignore all the tactical details, make our act under fire rolls and sort of make up the details to justify the rolls.  I think that latter style is actually <i>less</i> correct, but it often works too.<br/><br/><br/>Paul, read a sitch made it straight into my WoDu game too -- maybe on the first session.  Related to what I was writing just above, I used seize by force more than once to elide digging into the details of situation-resolution (because sometimes it's fun to dig in and other times it's fun to gloss over and fill in the blanks).  Another move that evolved as a standard was a sneak move.  I'm not finding my notes just now, but it was something like roll+dex and hold 0, 2, 4 or 6 -- spending the hold 1 each for each observer and 1 each for each sense with which they'd normally perceive you.

Without context it does seem rather stupid: character rigs demolition and kills himself.  <br/><br/>For the example to make any sense, we have to assume that this situation (ceiling rigged to blow, character next to statue) is the end result of some sort of challenging situation, where there's a reason the character couldn't just take their time and cover all the bases.  "Don't be an utter moron" is a terrible challenge.  "Can you take out this room full of monsters so they don't pursue you into the next room, all without alerting them to what's afoot so they'd escape, and also without getting killed, before the door shuts" would be more like it.  The player and character both get caught up in murder, haste, and avoiding detection, and they pull the trigger without considering the distance to the exit.  And the rest of the group hadn't considered that either, except now, as the player reaches for the dice, and we're all visualizing the attempt, someone realizes, "Uh oh..."<br/><br/>Christopher, which example?  If you're talking about the one guy who wrecks the strategy by charging in, I'm saying that guy is playing wrong if the other players were invested in reaping the fruits of their strategy, and he took their fun away from them.

I'll highlight the differences.\n<blockquote><b>In my OD&amp;D play</b>, if I set fire to a ceiling support, and I am standing a ways from the exit, then we'll precisely determine whether I have time to escape, and if not, I'm dead.  No roll.  "The ceiling definitely fell before you could make it to the door, so you are definitely dead."</blockquote>\nSure, that make sense to me. We might make all kinds of no-roll judgments like that when we play, too. Also, when we play OD&amp;D (Moldvay being our preferred one) we use the rules on page B60 -- <b>"There's always a chance."</b> Which means that, in your specific ceiling fire example, we would probably make a roll (it's a textbook example of when to use the "always a chance" system), unless the distance was absurd (you have to cover 100 meters in 2 seconds).\n<blockquote><b>In my AW play</b>, if I set fire to a ceiling support, and I am standing a ways from the exit, then we'll just roll to act under fire.  We won't bother to establish the exact details first, because they won't impact the number rolled.</blockquote>\nLet me stop you there. This is where the major disconnect is happening. The fictional details of the situation are super important in Apocalypse World. The fact that you think they're not, because they don't give a -1 to the roll, is the key issue in this discussion.<br/><br/>That is, in short, a shitty way to play AW. Not only is it counter to the specific instructions in the game book, it's just a lesser, paler, crappier mode of play.<br/><br/><b>Here's how it actually goes:</b><br/>You say you set fire to the ceiling supports. The MC says "You're really far away from the entrance, right? We talked about how big the room was and stuff. If you set it on fire, you won't be able to get out before the room collapses. But you're doing it anyway?"<br/><br/>(This is the interaction that we'd have playing OD&amp;D, too. In AW, this MC move is called "tell them the possible consequences and ask.")<br/><br/>If the player says, "Yep, I do it" then the character gets crushed by the burning ceiling. There's no roll, because the fictional details of the situation (that the MC is specifically tasked with cultivating, tracking, and expressing to the players) mean that the character is not, in fact, acting under fire. Same as if they said they jumped into a pool of acid. There's no roll, because they're not doing something in the fiction that triggers the move.<br/><br/>How do we know if they're triggering the move? <b>Because we pay attention to all the fictional details and bring them to bear in play.</b> (The AW game book is filled with examples of how to do this and how to correct mistakes when you do it wrong.)<br/><br/>In short, this:\n<blockquote>Let's say I pick up my dice to roll Act Under Fire, and you're the MC.  Imagine saying this to me: "Wait!  Didn't you say you were by the statue?  And didn't we establish the statue is 40 feet from the door?  And didn't we establish that your napalm ignition takes exactly 2 seconds and packs more explosive punch than this ceiling can handle?  Well, 40 feet in 2 seconds is beyond human running speed.  So, don't roll.  You're crushed by the falling roof.  That would seem to be 4 Harm." Would you do that?</blockquote>\nYES. Yes, we do that. A thousand times yes.<br/><br/>Each group chooses the level of detail that they want to assess in the fiction to determine move triggers (and also, especially, the details of move outcomes). Same as each OD&amp;D group decides how much they say when they disable a trap (talking about methods vs. describing the actual mechanism and saying which cable they cut). But the answer can't be "none at all."<br/><br/>The wealth of fictional details are what make the AW engine run. Otherwise, OF COURSE it doesn't give you any bang for your strategic buck. You're glossing over all of the stuff that makes it bang. You're playing a limp, weak version of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419650/#Comment_419650" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-06T14:11:17+00:00" title="August  6, 2013  2:11PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 6, 2013 3:47PM by John_Harper.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To complete the example, let me continue and show how the fictional details impact <i>act under fire</i> rolls (without giving a -1 to a roll):<br/><br/>"I set the ceiling support on fire, and run for the exit."<br/>"Really? It is waaaay too far. The ceiling will fall in and crush you before you escape."<br/>"Shit. Um, what about that stone altar thing? Can I run and dive under that?"<br/>"Uh, maybe?

I run for the altar."<br/>"Okay, you're acting under fire, and the fire is... duh, the <b>fire</b>. You're gonna try to be underneath the stone when the ceiling comes down."<br/>"Yeah. Crap, a 6."<br/>"Guess you didn't make it, huh? That's really too bad. A stone altar would be 3-armor or so. Anyway, it crushes you, everything goes black. 4-harm, for starters. Dusk, you're out in the factory, you hear this huge crash and smoke billows out from the chapel."<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>"I set the ceiling support on fire, and run for the exit."<br/>"Really? It is waaaay too far. The ceiling will fall in and crush you before you escape."<br/>"Shit. Um, I run for the exit anyway. I'm shouting to Dusk outside, maybe she'll hear me and at least know I'm trapped in here."<br/>"Yeah, maybe. It's a ways off, and she's in the factory, it's loud in there."<br/>"Gotta try anyway. Act under fire?"<br/>"Yeah. You gotta keep your cool enough to run under a burning ceiling instead of curling up in a ball and whimpering."<br/>"Heh. Ah... an 8?"<br/>"Well, the ceiling falls in on you, of course. That's 4-harm. Hey, Dusk, you hear Ruger shouting, then a huge crashing boom. Debris and smoke roll down the hallway from the chapel. What do you do?"<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>The fictional details establish the scope and outcomes -- the conditions -- of the roll.<br/><br/>In the first case, it was possible for Ruger to maybe get some armor against the ceiling harm, if he had made it under the altar. In the second case, he was able to let his friend know he was in there (sort of) before the ceiling fell on him, so maybe she could help him out.<br/><br/>In neither case did he get to "roll under fire to escape" since the fictional details of the situation made that impossible. His specific choices, and the details of the situation (the stone altar, the size of the room, the presence of his friend outside, the noisy factory) established the space in which the moves are given meaning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419653/#Comment_419653" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-06T15:16:30+00:00" title="August  6, 2013  3:16PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1 John Harper. <br/><br/>Every time I've seen an Apocalypse Engine go off the rails, it's because we were sloppy with the details of the fiction. <br/><br/>This ain't Dogs. <br/><br/><i>To do it, do it. </i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419658/#Comment_419658" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-06T16:04:44+00:00" title="August  6, 2013  4:04PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 6, 2013 4:17PM by Paul_T.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think Dave is talking about "being sloppy with the details of the fiction" here, at least not at the level you seem to be assuming. It's just that we're going to concentrate on different details, depending on what the system calls for. <br/><br/>AW makes it very easy for us to go:<br/><br/>"Is the PC in danger? Yes. Is it plausible that they could escape from the danger? Yes."  <br/><br/>-&gt;    roll Act Under Fire. (With equal odds of success each time.)<br/><br/>It's a feature of the system. Which, in turn, allows us to focus on other details. I've seen OSR dungeon-crawl characters carry chalk to mark their footpath across rooms and corridors, and always aware of how many more minutes their candle has remaining. (Do your WoDu/AW characters do that kind of thing?) However, I've never seen an OSR dungeon-crawl character take time to sharpen his or her weapons, unless some kind of mechanical consequence to weapons losing their edge is attached (i.e. a house rule).<br/><br/>But that's just one hurdle. A bigger one, in my opinion, is <i>the nature of the AW conversation</i>. The whole "MC talks to set up soft move -&gt; player responds, possibly with a move -&gt; misses -&gt; MC makes a hard move" pattern controls the flow of the conversation in a very fluid and natural way. But couldn't it get in the way when you're looking for fair and consistent adjudication of challenge? I, for one, would be pretty shocked if I were playing AW and the MC told me, "You're too far from the exit. The bomb goes off and you're dead," without any kind of soft move first (e.g. "offer an opportunity" or "tell the consequences and ask"). It's not how the conversation is supposed to go. There's a certain pacing built into it, and breaking that seems to me to be a dangerous proposition.<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>I notice that in your first example, the Act Under Fire move is: "Can the character make it to (relative) safety in time, or not?" In the second case, though, what's in question is whether the character can act at all ("keep your cool enough [...] instead of curling up into a ball and whimpering..."). Why this distinction? Is it just you exercising your GM judgement to keep the game interesting and to keep it moving, or is it a principled decision that you can explain and someone else could predict?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419659/#Comment_419659" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-06T16:11:17+00:00" title="August  6, 2013  4:11PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I still maintain you guys are barking completely up the wrong tree, at least as regards AW itself.

A lot of old-school modules have all kinds of death traps which can be triggered by careless adventurers (e.g. a room with a door which locks itself - and if the party walks through and lets it shut behind them, they're trapped in the room that's now filling with poison gas, or simpler examples like pit traps which activate if a player steps on a certain part of the floor - the player says they step there, and then they fall: there's no chance to avoid the trap once the action has been announced). I think it's good practice to "signal" their presence with, say, some dusty skeletons lying around or something similar, but if the characters are running through the corridor in the dark, without paying attention, I'd totally expect them to fall through without warning.<br/><br/>Granted, it's possible to play old-school D&amp;D without ever doing that, of course. That doesn't seem to me to be particularly on the "hardcore" side of things, though. <br/><br/>What do you think?

Sure some people wanted that sort of death-trap dungeon that pitted them against the DM in that "competition" sort of way you have mentioned -- I consider that a sub-catagory of "Tournament D&amp;D" though and I'm not convinced that was the default "difficulty setting" either though.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say we are talking past each other, but I'm beginning to think your experiences with OD&amp;D are different from mine on the whole.

My principles are on page 110 of AW. My techniques are on page 116. What I always say is on page 109. Is that flippant? It's the truth.<br/><br/>I'm... fatigued... by this line of inquiry. I want to help, really, but... I feel like I'm shouting into the wind. If it's not clear yet, I guess I'm not the one to clarify it.<br/><br/>Vincent wrote a whole RPG explaining how I play this way. Sage and Adam wrote one, too. I'm not doing magical techniques that are unaccounted for in those games, I swear. If I keep going, I think I'm gonna eventually write a game's worth of words here to essentially reproduce those works.

I don't know how to put this other than the way that Matt put it. <br/><br/>Yes, AW et al are geared differently than say, than games that are like 'lets defeat this dungeon optimally.' But I think, not for the reasons you're pointing out. I could be off base tho.<br/><br/>Act under fire / Defy Danger work almost identically to most check in the DnDs. And contrary to popular opinion, AW has less GM-fiat in it (ie none) than any 'trad' or 'gamist' game out there.<br/><br/>The difference between, say DW and OD&amp;D, isn't the mechanics but the focus. <br/><br/>When you're playing AW, you care about the minutia of the fiction as much as you do in OD&amp;D, but for very different reasons and with very different motives.<br/><br/>Like, in 'challenged-based gamist play' your agenda isn't <i>be a fan</i> or <i>make their lives interesting</i>, it's <i>adjudicate fairly</i> and <i>challenge the players</i>. <br/><br/>It's all in the title of the post: can AW et al be used for gamist play? I think we've made it pretty clear: abso-fucking-lutely it can. Can you modify it to get at gamist stuff? 100% yes.<br/><br/>Is it meant for that? No, Vincent's priorities have always been narrativist; he practically wrote the playbook. That's why there are plenty of moves that solve problems tactical and logistical problems for you, ezpz.<br/><br/>This has been mentioned up thread but I'll rephrase it: can AW and its derivatives be simultaneously and coherently gamist <i>and</i> narrativist at the same time? Probably not, but as everyone else has done a good job at pointing out, these things are less at odds then they seem initially.<br/><br/>What we've shown here, is that Creative Agenda is maybe less about the actual mechanics, and more about the priorities of particular groups. <br/><br/>System matters, sure, but so does your culture of play and your intentions while playing. <br/><br/>If anything, AW has made my playing across the board (GNS) richer and more refined.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419679/#Comment_419679" name="Item_119" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-06T23:54:33+00:00" title="August  6, 2013 11:54PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 7, 2013 4:36AM by David_Berg.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, I am kind of at a loss for how to respond to your mix of insults and useful examples.

An internet forum post about RPG techniques can frustrate me, but it can never hurt my feelings. There's no need to worry about insulting me.<br/><br/>The way I look at it is, if I say something rude, one of two things is true:<br/>1. I am totally off-base and talking nonsense -- I know nothing about how you play. In this case, I'm an idiot, and who cares what I think about your game?<br/><br/>2. I'm on the right track and say something helpful that makes someone's game better.<br/><br/>My rudeness is rudeness; I won't defend it as a good thing.

Although I'm not at all interested in slinging insults back and forth, so I'll stay out of that part of the conversation, if you don't mind. What I'd like to hear about is simply what I've been asking: they're various questions I'm quite curious about, whether they have good answers or not (e.g. some of them could simply have very personal answers, for instance).<br/><br/>For instance, in the case of the "Act Under Fire" rulings you posted, I'm honestly curious *which* principles (whether from the book or from your own brain) you use to make that kind of judgement. I'd like to be able to do the same thing, after all, but I don't see how I would get that particular answer from the Principles in AW (and not a different one). <br/><br/>I'm also willing to accept that the AW framework just presents a more unpredictable, chaotic method of resolution (from the character's perspective: you can't control very many variables), which is still suited to Gamist play.<br/><br/>And I'd love to hear about your contextual uses of the basic move in WoDu: were there typical uses which were common enough that you could almost encode them as basic moves after-the-fact? For instance, I've heard you mention before (I think) that in combat situations, on a 7-9, you pretty much always have both sides deal damage (assuming that both are trying to, of course). If you think back on your WoDu play, what kinds of "typical" uses could you see reaching the almost-basic-move stage of evolution?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul" title="Irminsul"><img alt="Irminsul" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul">Irminsul</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419717/#Comment_419717" name="Item_128" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-07T11:42:53+00:00" title="August  7, 2013 11:42AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 7, 2013 11:49AM by Irminsul.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In truth I think most of your questions were already answered:\n<blockquote>I still have lots of more specific questions, which I can repost if people are still willing to engage.</blockquote>\nThat said I'm still willing to discuss them.

No! Of course it isn't. Language sucks.<br/><br/>Thinking on it, there is one technique that I am implicitly but not explicitly describing (and it looks to me like others are as well) and that is: just being okay with it (aka "confidence"). When I did it, I was like "I cobbled some shit together, we're gonna play thing thing, it's gonna work, it's gonna be awesome." And that was pretty much it. I didn't worry about being fair or challenging enough, I just did my best and tried to have a fun game with the people I was running it for (and we did). This is kind of a hard technique to pass on to someone else though, because either you have it or you don't, really. I mean I guess? Anyway, that was definitely one of the things that helped me in play -- I didn't <i>worry</i> about fairness and challenges and all that stuff, I just did it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419720/#Comment_419720" name="Item_131" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-07T11:55:18+00:00" title="August  7, 2013 11:55AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/akooser">@akooser</a>,<br/><br/>Thanks for the AP, it's a good example, actually.

I don't worry about it at all, I just do it -- and I mean the fairness and the challenges stuff. I <i>just did it</i>, without it being a big issue.<br/><br/>Like, I do the best I can to be fair, yeah, and if the players think something is off, we hash it out. This can mean discussing things and setting precedents like Eero does, sure. But getting a dungeon finished in time to run it and making sure it feels like Planet Algol were much higher priorities than worrying about fair adjudication. Which actually brings up another tip: What do the players think? Do they think you are being fair? Do they accept your rulings or do they argue about them all the time? Obviously you have to come to some kind of consensus with them or they will eventually stop playing with you.

The new games are <i>mechanically</i> fair: that is to say the power levels are on an equal playing field. They even have level appropriate challenges... Challenge Ratings I think? And because new school D&amp;D has <i>so much</i> exactness it interferes with itself more -- then one gets the whole "the ceiling is collapsing and you can't move past the orc without taking an Attack of Opportunity and your movement rate can't get you out in time because we are using a battle-map and you don't have a feat for that so you can't do it" issue.<br/><br/>But that isn't the same in OD&amp;D or AW: so those two share a lot of similarities.

You know what is stopping you? Turns and time.<br/><br/>For fairness to really be inherent to AW et al, you'd need to quantify fictional/narrative/game time. <br/><br/>I might be way off, but the way AW handles temporality is very, very different from the way that New School DnD does (indeed, most games.)<br/><br/>In basically every game I can think of (Starcraft, World of Warcraft, Chess, Go, Magic, Poker, etc) turns or structured time/actions is the pivot and foundation for all fairness and challenge in the game. In AW, you're limited by your fictional position (ie game state) sure, but there isn't any additional linear chronological structure on top of that. In most games it's the notion of the turn, in RTS it's real-time (minutes and seconds) but we have no similar structures in AW.<br/><br/>Time in AW isn't chronological: it's kairological. It's not linear, repetitive, strict or quantitative, but rather it's opportunistic, contextual, loose, and qualitative.<br/><br/>This, incidentally, is why Monsterhearts is harder to game then AW.

A certain amount of that is crucial, obviously, but the last 10% between 'basically as fair as we can manage' and 'perfectly fair' seems to suffer from enormously diminishing returns.<br/><br/>Like even if after I play, me and the GM could be chatting and be like 'yeah I think that was weird how you handled that, probably it wasn't super fair' -- but that wouldn't somehow mean we weren't engaging in challenge-based play, or that the play in question was invalidated somehow. Like, maybe we agreed after that it was unfair, but I still won -- now I'm even more super-badass, go me? -- or maybe now the context for my failure is different, but the gameplay was still the same basic thing.<br/><br/>So what I'm really wondering is what it is that OD&amp;D type games provide that actually support this sort of fairness, given that they appear to rely just as exclusively on GM judgement calls as WoDu and the like. (With the exception of little bits of wargame-combat which I feel most people agree is not really particularly relevant to the conversation or even this style of play?)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419775/#Comment_419775" name="Item_145" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-08T04:51:50+00:00" title="August  8, 2013  4:51AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great points, Orlando and Ice Cream Emperor, about (respectively) time and diminishing returns.<br/><br/>Here's what I think: on paper, D&amp;D3.5/PF is, in fact, objectively fairer than AW. However, in practice the reverse may often be true: because AW is simpler, easier to understand, much easier to <i>run</i>, fairly straightforward to min-max (although it still requires some skill), etc., the chances of each participant having their approximately-equal share of time in the spotlight and approx-= chances to rise to the game's challenges are pretty good!<br/><br/>Whereas new-school D&amp;D and similar games often suffer from the problem of not every player being on the same page about how to min-max, or the GM being a railroading dickhead, or some combination of similar problems, which make the game *feel* very un-fair.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419782/#Comment_419782" name="Item_146" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-08T06:26:00+00:00" title="August  8, 2013  6:26AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Now, I am certainly aware that the MC/GM can always strive (and maybe even succeed) at being fair and consistent, and that's great.

The text of World of Dungeons is admittedly circumspect on how to run the game, compared to say Apocalypse World.  But if we imagine that we're playing WoDu and taking a bunch of education about how to run from AW, then I think it's pretty similar to OD&amp;D.<br/><br/>In what I <i>think</i> we mean by OD&amp;D, there's this idea that when the referee devises a procedure to adjudicate some certain situation that isn't covered by the rules or the 'common-law' that's accreted, she will (usually?) make it known and record it for future use.  It's part of the rules barring some future challenge.  Is that about right?<br/><br/>In Apocalypse World, there is this powerful directive to make <i>principled</i> decisions.  One clear implication of that is that the MC response must arise out of the fiction that's been narrated.  But also, by following the various principles and agenda, etc that the book sets out to guide the MC.  So when following the principles, when the fiction enters a similar tactical space, you've got these two things pushing you, as MC, to resolve things similarly to how you did it before.  You're in the same head-space, following the same principles, and looking at similar fiction -- so why <i>wouldn't</i> you react similarly?  Sure, in AW, you might look down at the list of MC moves and pull a different one than you did last time, but there's nothing like that in WoDu -- you and the other players have talked into the situation, described some dangers, made a roll.  And if the results are like last time and you've described the same dangers, what would magically lead you to some inconsistent result?  I just don't see it.<br/><br/>So Paul, with that in mind, please explain from where inconsistency arises when playing WoDu but not OD&amp;D.<br/><br/>And if the "design of the system" of WoDu isn't pushing things in that direction, what is it about the design of OD&amp;D's system that does?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419794/#Comment_419794" name="Item_147" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-08T09:24:01+00:00" title="August  8, 2013  9:24AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting, Christopher. I agree that if we discuss and negotiate the possible outcomes of rolls in WoDu before we roll, it becomes much more "D&amp;D-like" (in the sense of the players being able to judge the level of risk in their actions). <br/><br/>How many people play it that way? I always assumed that WoDu should be run more or less like AW, instead.

Most of what I hear about people playing *World game is more in line with Vincent's intentions for the original game. For example, here was a popular response in an earlier thread we had about modifying difficulties in AW:\n<blockquote>[...] I don't find modifying rolls very compelling. If its take a +1 forward because you had a conversation, or heard a thing in passing, or because you examined the door before opening it, I think the game loses something.<br/><br/>I also like that the MC isn't concerned with how difficult something is beyond whether the outcome is certain or uncertain. I like that the MC is occupied with how difficult something looks, rather than how difficult it actually is. I'd rather the dice tell me if it was too difficult after the PC makes the attempt, rather than figuring that out in advance. Sometimes something looks more difficult than it is. The MC doesn't know. The MC is playing to find out.</blockquote>\nI feel that this is a good encapsulation of the AW mindset. Adapting the same mechanics and conversation to a more challenge-oriented approach, we have to discard a lot of this kind of accumulated wisdom/philosophy surrounding the game and build a new framework. It's not impossible to do, but so far I'm unconvinced that it's trivial, let's say.<br/><br/><br/>(Here are the two earlier threads about modeling the difficulty of a given action in AW, which were both very interesting - and not too long, we got to the good stuff pretty quickly each time. I'd say the cover the bases pretty thoroughly.

They're not usually straight situational modifiers.<br/><br/>Because the math is so tight, it is almost always better to not adjust difficulty, but rather adjust the <i>results</i>. If your fictional position is better, you will get <i>more</i> out of the roll.

with Scrape on this one: that's how I've been reading (and running) AW and its descendants.\n<blockquote><br/>I am curious what some examples are of OD&amp;D rules (in the broad sense) that support fairness in adjucating. <br/></blockquote>\nWell, we've already discussed, for instance, the measurement of time and turns: we keep of movement rates and resources spent, everyone gets an equal chance to act, and so on.<br/><br/>Another example is the function of "DM rulings", as described in the Old-School Primer. The 1977 Basic D&amp;D set describes this as follows:\n<blockquote>You are sure to encounter situations not covered by these rules. Agree on a probability that an event will occur and convert it into a die roll - roll the number and see what happens!</blockquote>\nIn particular, this comes into play when a certain plan is attempted which has a very high or a very low chance of failure. Let's say a dungeon heist revolves around a character throwing a glass jar full of oil in through a door into complete darkness: he can't see where he's throwing it, but is hoping that it lands on a pressure plate about 4 feet across. If he succeeds, the death trap will be deactivated and the party will survive. If he fails, the party will be trapped and quickly perish.

If I close my eyes and shoot, what gets hit? Can an MC apply their principles to that situation? Personally, I've never seen it come up at the table but it's worth thinking about, I suppose.<br/><br/>Edit 'cause I'm mulling this over: I think that this doesn't come up very often precisely because the fiction models everything so well, without numbers. With a GURPS-like "physics engine," the game is telling you that mechanics will accommodate anything, and that every advantage can be applied numerically. A natural extension of this thought process is "so what are my <i>odds of success</i>? What's the chance that the gun jams? What's the chance that X happens instead...?" However, in AW, the game is telling us "Whatever happens,<i> it will make sense</i>, you will not be shocked by the 1% possibilities. A freak accident won't ruin your plan, only a real obstacle will do that. If you set yourself up for success then <i>you will be successful.</i> That's an important statement! It seems to make my players dig deep into the fiction and get their ducks in a row, ensuring the best outcomes when they can. It has never, so far, made them want to take a wild stab in the dark. The planned, considered action is always more attractive to them.<br/><br/>To me, that seems to mesh <i>really well</i> with challenge-based play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419988/#Comment_419988" name="Item_154" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-13T11:55:22+00:00" title="August 13, 2013 11:55AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The random call / die of fate issue is actually pretty interesting in a wider context, it comes up in many different games. (I'm not that hot to trod specifically about whether AW is or isn't a gamist game - seems like a pretty academic question for anybody not specifically interested in trying to play it that way.) Some games incorporate it in their systems, while for others it's anathema, not unlike e.g. random character generation, which is a similar technical issue that runs through unrelated games. The usual split is between whether the game assumes a GM with dramatic coordination duties, or whether the game assumes a neutral referee; in the former case a game may opt to say that "there is no luck", and therefore a legitimate die of fate does not exist - if one is rolled, that's a player abrogating their responsibility to make creative choices. On the other hand, a game that doesn't do dramatic coordination, such as old school D&amp;D, relies heavily on arbitrary dicing to randomize events that are out of the hands of the player characters, and therefore an impromptu randomization is the only fair way of refereeing a sequence.<br/><br/>My reading of AW doesn't indicate that it'd be a game for random calls - it's more like TSoY, wherein the Story Guide just frames situations and outcomes to maximize character spotlight and potential for dramatic choices, and the conflict resolution system is utilized abstractly to cover the gaps. Thus the AW MC would presumably rule that e.g. a Hail Mary throw would succeed or not on the basis of his own arbitrary aesthetics, or he would deem it a move so as to incorporate it into the conflict resolution system. (Presumably the choice would depend on how exactly the event had been framed - did the player offer this fictional event as a move of his own, or was it just an open invitation for the MC to move the events along?) Not an expert here, though, so maybe there is some minor room for the other sort of technique in there that I haven't noticed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419991/#Comment_419991" name="Item_155" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-13T12:45:36+00:00" title="August 13, 2013 12:45PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess my concern is that there's no modeling of difficulty. And maybe that's just me failing to fully adopt the AW Newthink. <br/><br/>Let's say you get into a bad gunfight. You want to run away. It's probably Act under Fire. (Forgive me if I use the wrong moves; it's been a year since I played AW.)  My worry is that as long as you can narrate some kind of plausible "run away," it's the same roll. It doesn't matter how awesome your plan for running away is. Act under Fire. Where's the challenge there?<br/><br/>Maybe the answer is, "It's not there; it's somewhere else," and that's fine. But that part of AW doesn't seem particularly challenge-facilitating to me. In a gunfight you probably only have a couple possible moves at all, and probably two (Act under Fire, Seize Something by Force). So you pick one and narrate the bare minimum to get the GM to let you do it.<br/><br/>To be challenge-facilitating, a game has to give players choices and some choices have to be better than others and optimizing those choices has to be non-trivial. The main choices that AW gives players is what happens on a 7-9 roll, and maybe that's the challenging part that I'm not seeing clearly.<br/><br/>Perhaps BECAUSE "to do it, do it" rules the game, GMs have no room for fiat. That fiat is what makes OSR games work. "I cover the ten sheep in pitch, light them on fire, and drive them into Temple of Darkness!" First, I'm not even sure how I'd adjudicate that in AW. Second, there basically needs to be a move there, right? <br/><br/>Admittedly, that last bit is a totally nascent thought, not fully formed in the least. I considered deleting it, but I think there is enough there that has value to be worth letting it live. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419993/#Comment_419993" name="Item_156" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-13T13:33:50+00:00" title="August 13, 2013  1:33PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2013 1:37PM by David_Berg.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there's been some disconnect in this thread about fictional vs mechanical risk/reward choices.  To summarize:<br/>AWnotG: "In AW your cleverness doesn't impact your success!"<br/>AWyesG: "Yes it does!  Your fictional choices impact the fictional possibility space which determines what you stand to gain or lose!"<br/>AWnotG: "But your tactics have no bearing on your likelihood of success!"<br/>AWyesG: "Sure they do!  Sometimes the fiction will dictate that you don't even get or need a roll!"<br/><br/>I don't think the "not Gamist" description is sufficiently clear, and I don't think the "yes Gamist" response actually addresses it.  <br/><br/>I don't think anyone could contend that in AW the fiction is irrelevant and therefore player attempts to skillfully work with it for strategic advantage are also irrelevant.  Yeah?  No need to defend AW from that; that isn't the accusation that's being leveled.<br/><br/>Instead, it's a question of <i>how</i> relevant and <i>in what ways</i> are what <i>types</i> of skill?<br/><br/>There's a common situation in old-school D&amp;D play where the players are looking at two options, and one would yield more loot or advantage than the other, but it's also harder than the other, and so players are faced with a choice like "climb the difficulty-3 hill for a better view, or climb the difficulty-15 mountain for ambush position?"  In AW, analogous fictional uncertainty is handled very differently by the rules.  The choice might instead be "read a situation with not much the MC can obviously do to you if you fail, or read a more informative situation wherein failure might mean the MC could say you fall down a mountain".  <br/><br/>These are different types of choices.  Due to the leeway the MC is afforded in AW, the AW choice offers nothing so concrete in terms of probability as "3 vs 17".  The choice in AW is more vague and approximate in terms of how the relative difficulties of the two options will manifest, at least until the group comes up with their own solution involving secondary rolls or countdown clocks or something.  In D&amp;D play, on the other hand, the landscape is dominated by numbers that can be compared to each other, <i>assuring</i> players of a certain relationship between their choices.<br/><br/>Separately, I also think most readings/playings of AW render "you don't need to roll, that would simply succeed/fail" <i>much</i> rarer than in the more numbers-lite old school gaming I do.  So rather than "3 or 17" vs "extremely specific outcome distributions A or B", it's more like "whatever makes sense in the fiction, to be determined specifically, full stop" vs "whatever makes sense in the fiction within a very wide range of possibilities, to be navigated by the move".<br/><br/>I realize AW allows you to add +1 and -1 for "this is hard" or "that action is perfect", but that seems rare from the AP I've read.  It rewards a kind of probability-based thinking that most groups don't bring to AW in the first place because the game doesn't otherwise incline them to use it.<br/><br/>Anyone who wants to say that none of this matters is simply failing to acknowledge the importance of certain features to many Gamist players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419994/#Comment_419994" name="Item_157" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-13T13:51:42+00:00" title="August 13, 2013  1:51PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>David:</b> To jump back in after a long time away. I think you're right on the money there. There's a few other things I would add.<br/><br/>The probability of success in most AW-based games does change in one critical way: through being able to leverage relevant information &amp; positioning gained through the tactical use of other moves. The best example of this is Read a Charged Situation, right? You ask question and if you can use the answers to your benefit, you take +1 on any roll where you do that (up to a +3, if you can take advantage of all three questions from a 10+ result). There are also a bunch of other moves that give you +1 forward in certain situations, including Helping, but also a bunch of other things that are more ideosyncratic. But in my experience, Read a Charged Situation gets used all the time in AW to gain the fictional positioning necessary to improve a PC's odds of success in an unlikely act. This seems to be ignored so far in this discussion because it's not the GM setting a difficulty but rather the GM describing the situation and the player essentially lowering the difficulty if they can maneuver themselves into such a way that they can take advantage of it. Honestly, I think this plays a major role in the tactical play of AW.<br/><br/>I also think that the process of manuvering to take advantage of a situation (whether in the aftermath of a Read move or something else), if the MC is paying attention, often puts a character in a position where they don't really need to roll. I agree that many MCs are loathe to just say something succeeds, but I think that has more to do with gamer baggage than it does with how AW works under ideal circumstances. From my own experience, every time I've said: "Yeah, I don't think that's really a formal move; I think you just do it," I don't think I've once regretted it.<br/><br/>In general, though, you're mostly right about AW fictional positioning not always changing the odds of a move (with a huge caveat for Read a Charged Situation, Helping, and other such moves), but instead potentially changing what moves you have to make (or if you even have to make moves) and -- more importantly -- the fictional consequences for partial successes and failures. Honestly, in practice, I don't find that much different from sandbox D&amp;D where you try to make the best tactical choices you can. If people are hung up on setting specific difficulties and don't like how Read a Charged Situation handles it, it seems like that probably has to do more with their mechanical preferences and comfort zones than it does with any weakness of the AW engine in handling challenge-based play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419996/#Comment_419996" name="Item_158" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-13T14:19:25+00:00" title="August 13, 2013  2:19PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2013 2:21PM by Paul_T.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Indeed. I'm glad Dave posted, because he has a knack for explaining these things a little more clearly than I do (since I feel like I've been saying the same thing all along, but I guess I haven't been clear enough).<br/><br/>As for Read a Charged Situation, it's a good example of leveraging fictional circumstances for increased chance of success. However, it's not a wide-ranging tool for player-GM negotiation, like the workspace move. (Also, it doesn't exist in WoDu.)<br/><br/>It's a move that's effective only in certain situations (because there's a limited list of questions you can ask), only sometimes (based on a lucky roll), and only for certain characters (those who have a bad related stat might never succeed, or even bother trying). So it's quite possible to have a number of situations in play where this leverage isn't available to the player at all.<br/><br/>(At the other end of the spectrum, in some styles of play this move might be <i>too</i> effective: the danger is, instead, that the answers you can get simply by rolling the dice circumvent the kind of challenge you're trying to present. For instance, let'say the challenge at hand is, "There's a huge Piercer hiding in an alcove on the ceiling of this dark chamber. Will the adventurers be smart enough to take precautions so as to discover its presence before it kills one of them?" In OD&amp;D, finding a way to figure out if there's a danger in the darkness above would be quite a challenge. With the Read a Sitch move, all it takes is for someone to get a decent roll and ask, "What should I be on the lookout for?" I don't see this as quite as big a problem, but I can see why some people might.)<br/><br/>[As a total sidenote, Vincent has always made it clear that the +1 from acting on the answers does <i>not</i> stack. It might not be clear in the book, but that's always been his answer to that question online.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><i>EDIT: By the way, the "reading" moves are my absolute favourite part of Apocalypse World!

Most of the challenge- in AW challenge-based play does not involve dice. It isn't about manipulating numbers, or 'odds of success' in a specific mechanical sense. It's about gathering a sufficient understanding of the fiction so as to open up possibilities for tactical actions that weren't otherwise available, and maximizing the positive consequences from the rolls you do have to make.<br/><br/>Which confuses me because while I haven't played any/much OD&amp;D, this was always exactly what I thought the whole OSR-style dungeon crawl was about as well. You use your ten-foot pole so you don't have to roll the dice; you describe your perfect unexpected plan so you don't have to fight the goblins; you fictionally-optimize the ever-loving crap out of your actions, because otherwise the dice will punish you (often arbitrarily/fatally/intensely.)<br/><br/>This is why I asked about what tools OD&amp;D provided that WoDu-type games did not.

A lot of times folks treat their PCs "like stolen cars" (to borrow one of Joe's phrases) and aren't as concerned with maximizing their chances of success or personal betterment. That said, if you're trying to do something that's really dangerous, I have seen players try to avoid making a bunch of critical rolls (because of the likelihood of something going wrong) and manuevering to just make 1 crucial roll or not having to roll at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420000/#Comment_420000" name="Item_162" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-13T15:36:42+00:00" title="August 13, 2013  3:36PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            P.S.

(Forgive me if I use the wrong moves; it's been a year since I played AW.)  My worry is that as long as you can narrate some kind of plausible "run away," it's the same roll. It doesn't matter how awesome your plan for running away is. Act under Fire. Where's the challenge there?</blockquote>\nThis is such a common misconception, but there's no need for it to remain that way. Seriously, go back and read some of John Harper's posts; he's clarified this so many times. Difficulty is <i>absolutely</i> modeled in AW, it's just not given mechanical modifiers. Like, it's <i>not</i> just the roll: you get <i>better results</i> from your roll with a better position.<br/><br/>Here's yet another super oversimplified example:\n<blockquote><b>Character with bad positioning:</b>"I'm totally surrounded by blazing gunfire and have no cover or safe route! I'm screwed! I want to run away!"<br/><b>MC:</b> "Sure, but like you said, you're screwed. You'll take a bullet no matter what, Act Under Fire to see if you can even make it out alive."</blockquote>\n<blockquote><b>Character with good positioning:</b> "I want out of this gunfight! Good thing I'm behind cover with an established escape route!"<br/><b>MC:</b> "Yup, that's good for you. Act Under Fire to see if they notice your escape."</blockquote>\n<i>Yes</i>, it's the same roll. <i>No</i>, it's not the same difficulty. Your fictional position means <i>everything</i>, it basically sets the stakes for what 'danger' you're even facing. Every time a character is trying to avoid danger, the MC is supposed to ask themselves, "what could go wrong here?" If the character has set themselves up so that very little can go wrong, then the 'Fire' in Act Under Fire will be very different.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul" title="Irminsul"><img alt="Irminsul" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul">Irminsul</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420003/#Comment_420003" name="Item_164" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-13T16:03:36+00:00" title="August 13, 2013  4:03PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2013 4:06PM by Irminsul.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You use your ten-foot pole so you don't have to roll the dice; you describe your perfect unexpected plan so you don't have to fight the goblins; you fictionally-optimize the ever-loving crap out of your actions, because otherwise the dice will punish you (often arbitrarily/fatally/intensely.)<br/><br/>This is why I asked about what tools OD&amp;D provided that WoDu-type games did not.

In AW, this challenge is removed from the players and undertaken by the characters, with utility divorced from cleverness.  Applying the useful info gleaned from a successful Read to a subsequent roll is not a challenge, in my experience.  Either it's easy and obvious to apply, or impossible to apply.  Some old school DMs have mastered the ability of dropping factoids that the players might or might not be able to exploit.  In AW, being able to ask the MC "which enemy is most vulnerable to me?" and get an honest answer short-circuits that challenge.<br/><br/>It is pretty sweet that in AW you don't have to worry as much about GMs being shifty or failing to communicate what they intend!  Being obligated to answer those Read questions is very useful, and way better than a <i>bad</i> old-school GM.  But it can also eliminate the need for players to scheme.  I mean, "what should I be on the lookout for?"  Are you kidding me?  In my preferred play style, <b>I</b> need to tell <b>you</b> what I'm on the lookout for -- that's how I'm being clever!  If you just tell me, and then I do it, that's my <i>character</i> being clever, not <i>me</i>.<br/><br/>So it's not <i>just</i> about target numbers here.  It's about AW enabling groups to not sweat a variety of stuff that they do sweat in OD&amp;D.  Of course AW doesn't <i>force</i> you to not sweat that stuff.  You <i>can</i> describe and negotiate and describe and negotiate until you don't need a roll, just like any other RPG.  It simply strikes me as a counter-intuitive way to play AW, that's all.  The games gives you way quicker and easier alternatives.  OD&amp;D doesn't.<br/><br/>When I played AW, my Hocus advanced like crazy (folks wanted to see me do the stuff that made my guy who he was, thus I got XP every time I rolled), and was soon rolling at +3 for nearly everything he cared to do.  Die rolls were not something to avoid, they were something to pursue for achievements I couldn't otherwise get just by being clever.  "I can coast and roll dice and then figure out how to milk my 10+; strategy not required."  To point out that I <i>could</i> strategize anyway sounds kinda "design doesn't matter" to me.<br/><br/>To all the folks out there who are strategizing their way out of rolling AW dice, hey, sounds fun to me, but why are you using the AW rules then?  Play it freeform!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420006/#Comment_420006" name="Item_166" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-13T16:29:12+00:00" title="August 13, 2013  4:29PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2013 4:32PM by David_Berg.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>This is why I asked about what tools OD&amp;D provided that WoDu-type games did not.

"Carefully calibrated to make for interesting challenges and decisions": that's what I was talking about.  Hill vs mountain was simply easier to describe than Mindflayer vs Bugbear.

Until they opt into danger for reward.  "We could flee the Mindflayer, but I want the loot behind it, so let's fight!" is a decision to embrace some rolling.  And that decision is based on some knowledge about the rolls, and some sense of how they compare to other options.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420007/#Comment_420007" name="Item_167" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-13T16:32:11+00:00" title="August 13, 2013  4:32PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote><br/>"set a probability and roll"</blockquote>\nDoes not exist in OD&amp;D.</blockquote>\nWhat?

Examples:<br/><br/>"Ok, the magical guided arrow zooms around the corner, seeking another target... you three are in the room, Arwen is just outside the door. Who does it decide to pursue? Probably not Arwen, since it couldn't 'see' her from where it's coming around the corner. How about we roll a d6, 1-2 it's you, 3-4 it's you, and 5-6 it's you? Sounds fair enough? Let's do it."<br/><br/>"At the bottom of the cliff you find the gear you dropped the previous day. Some animals came through and ate or stole all the food. Oh, you're looking for the 12 torches you had in your packs? Well, the packs weren't tied or anything, so probably some of them would have fallen out on the way down and ended up in the river. Maybe even most of them. Here, I'll roll 2d4 to see how many of them you can recover."<br/><br/>Some of these rules were codified, as well - like Wandering Monsters rolls or Resurrection Percentage Chance rules.

And goes hand-in-hand with the way the AW conversation works, as well. Consider my examples in this post, above: the tool AW gives you to deal with this kind of thing is the MC moves - arbitrated by the Principles, of course. Instead of trying to find a fair way to decide who is the target of the arrow, for instance, the MC is directed to be a fan of the players and to make a move, which could range from "offer an opportunity" to "inflict harm". A move like "put someone in a spot" is designed to create a challenging situation, not to offer a balanced challenge to a united group in a way that's fair and takes into account minor differences in fictional positioning.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul" title="Irminsul"><img alt="Irminsul" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul">Irminsul</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420008/#Comment_420008" name="Item_168" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-13T16:41:52+00:00" title="August 13, 2013  4:41PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2013 4:55PM by Irminsul.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay.

Lets roll 1d6 and on a 5-6 it is" or "how many bandit raiders are there?" or "is there a Wanding Monster?" or "is this a stupid example roll 1d6 and on a 1-6 it is" stuff. Meh. Whatever. I don't see any real problem with that and it certainly has nothing to do with challenging gameplay.<br/><br/>Does that actually make you think Dungeon World or World of Dungeons can't give challenges? Or that OD&amp;D does challenge because of the occasional random roll for the occasional, luck based, random things?<br/><br/>I <i>had thought</i> you meant "the difficulty is 30 so roll and try to get a 30" or "roll 1d6 and on a 2-6 the ceiling falls on you and you die".

It attacked us with strands of evil which were very damaging.  Also, some skeletons were attacking from the rear.  Also, the Philosopher had shown some images about a fleet being hired by the city to defend it, then turning around and sacking it.  Our group had 6 PCs who were still alive at this point.  We each got one action per round, and this combat probably lasted about 8 rounds.  So that's about 50 actions until we wound up turning and running to avoid a TPK.  Here are the choices we had to consider when budgeting those 50 actions:<br/>- Attack the damaging strands.  Remove the most immediate and severe threat, temporarily, before they come back.<br/>- Damage the Philosopher.  Clearly needs to be done at some point, but given scant evidence of what attacks wound him, should we leave it to the guy with the +2 sword only?  Or should we all pile on to whittle down his massive hit points?<br/>- Stop the Philosopher by means other than damage.  Web, sleep, etc. -- do we have anything that would work?<br/>- Talk to the Philosopher.  We know Grey Philosophers are stuck on some question, and we have some guesses as to what it might be.  Could we answer it for him by offering to fight the traitorous fleet?  Talking is slow, though, as rounds are measured in 1-2 seconds, so that risks wasting a ton of actions.<br/>- Use our most prized magic item, a one-use scroll that summons a small group of undead warriors for one endeavor.

It's pretty brilliant, and makes me want to try the same thing sometime.<br/><br/>At one point, Saruman (one of the PCs) charms an Ogre they encounter, and the Ogre, instead of attacking them, starts traveling with the group. This is a good thing, because this Ogre would probably have killed many (or even all of them), being significantly bigger and stronger: a real menace. Having the Ogre along as a sort of "henchman" allows the group to survive all kinds of situations. But the problem is: if the Charm ever wears off (which could also happen if Saruman is killed), the Ogre will probably start slaughtering them. So it's a dangerous situation! They're walking around with a time bomb, essentially.<br/><br/>So how do we decide when the Ogre snaps out of the Charm and goes ballistic on his mind-controlling captors?<br/><br/>From what I know of Apocalypse World, my approach as the MC would be to:<br/><br/> a) Follow the guidelines of the fiction established (if there are any significant precedents to what snaps someone out of a Charmed state, how long it typically lasts, and stuff like that - if Charm is something that operates on a scale of weeks, I'm not going to have the Ogre snap out of it 2 minutes later, and so on).<br/><br/>b) Keep the Principles in mind. "Being a fan of the characters" means, among other things, that I probably won't have the Ogre snap out of the Charm and start killing them in their sleep unless I can get some kind of exciting scene out of it, and present it with softer moves first, so they have a chance to react.<br/><br/>c) Pick a moment which is fictionally believable/consistent, in accordance with my Principles, and the timing is right in terms of dramatic coordination (Eero's excellent term - who's there, what's happening, what's at stake, etc). When and if it's my turn to make a move**, if it feels right, I'll put this into action, hoping for a moment of maximum impact. If it's in reaction to something a PC does, all the better ("an opportunity on a golden plate"). I'll probably use softer moves first to set it up, as well.<br/><br/>This group (playing B/X D&amp;D) has a different approach, and one that's pretty exactly by-the-book:<br/><br/>a) Establish the possible duration of the Charm spell (it's in the spell description, in this case) and have the GM secretly roll the exact duration. Now it's set, but the players don't know how long it will last. However, they know the possible range (whether it's 3d6 days or whatever), so they can make an informed decision about how much they're willing to risk before they get rid of the Ogre one way or another.<br/><br/>b) The DM also explicitly outlines how he will handle other situations, such as how he will deal with a lapse in the Charm (quoted below) or situations where the Ogre is asked to do certain dangerous tasks (the Ogre gets an additional saving throw against the spell). This is an arbitrary ruling at first ("GM fiat", etc, etc) but consistent once it's settled in play as <i>the</i> principled way to handle this kind of situation, and the players can count on that going forward.\n<blockquote>If we had a situation where the ogre broke the charm--and Eowyn could speak either chaotic or ogre--and Eowyn did something like stepping forward and trying to talk the ogre down, I would likely handle it this way:<br/><br/>1: Ogre starts in hostile disposition on the reaction table.<br/>2: Eowyn rolls + charisma modifier.<br/>3: on a leave result, ogre leaves but will consider Fellowship enemy and will attack if he sees them again. A friendly result would allow him to part on friendly terms, but he would likely not volunteer to join the group.<br/><br/>Eowyn doesn't speak either of these languages, but if the ogre stays with them much longer, I'm going to assume they have picked up enough ogre words for very basic communication.</blockquote>\nSo it seems to me that these are dramatically different approaches, and this example illustrates that pretty well. They're suited to completely different types of gaming, with completely different agendas. <br/><br/>Is there a way to use the AW/WoDu rules in a way that the D&amp;D group I'm quoting here would find satisfactory? If so, how?<br/><br/>Or is "Gamist WoDu/AW" play just a completely different beast, needing different tools and different principles? If so, what's that like?<br/><br/><br/>*: Cross-posted with the above couple of posts.<br/><br/>**: This part is absolutely key, as well. If it so happens that I, as the MC, don't get a chance to make a move about this during a given scene, then the Ogre's charm will effectively "last longer". That's not necessarily about how clever the players are being, but about the rate of dialogue around the table and what we're choosing to focus on at any given time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul" title="Irminsul"><img alt="Irminsul" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul">Irminsul</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420015/#Comment_420015" name="Item_171" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-13T20:12:50+00:00" title="August 13, 2013  8:12PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2013 8:31PM by Irminsul.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> Thanks for the example, I think it is helpful. Yep, I see that! And I agree that Apocalypse World, in particular, doesn\u2019t really fit a lot of the time for the reasons you give. Particularly in that specific situation. And upthread I also said AW doesn\u2019t really work when compared to OD&amp;D because of the focus on other things like sex and messing with other player\u2019s rolls and whatnot.<br/><br/>The times I\u2018ve played AW we weren\u2018t really even a group. Not in the OD&amp;D sense of the word anyway. We happened to be in the same area. Maybe had sex or other relations, helped or hindered each other for short times, but we certainly didn\u2018t OD&amp;D \u201cadventure\u201c together. Not in any AW games I\u2018ve been in anyway. Not to mention that a single hit generally takes out any NPC, so yeah, your example can\u2019t really happen in AW.<br/><br/>So we agree there 100% that your example would not work in Apocalypse World. So \u201cis AW suited to challenge play?\u201d - I wouldn\u2019t say it is optimal for it in an OSR way. But I still think that it can be played in a similar fashion: fiction first is very much an OD&amp;D thing too. And I still think the players can be challenged in AW with difficult choices. Maybe even a trap or similar. Heck I think Vincent\u2019s examples in the book demonstrate how the players are being challenged and making hard choices based on the fiction (the one at the beginning of the \u201cMoves Snowball\u201d section).<br/><br/>However I do think that all of those things in your example could happen in Dungeon World or World of Dungeons. The (in)famous DW dragon example would be another. Those games do have expendable items and magic swords and magic spells and hit points and et cetera.<br/><br/>I dunno, maybe I\u2019m missing something here?<br/><br/>Maybe my definition of \u201cchallenge the players\u201d is different than what you all are saying? Are we just talking about combat challenge? [Tangent: for example, when I challenge a players Beliefs in Burning Wheel I\u2019d count that too.]\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/Irminsul">@Irminsul</a>, if you read my post just above Paul's, I think that may be more pertinent.  Agreed, rolling for rain is irrelevant.</blockquote>\nAgreed! <br/><br/><br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> thing is: I think all of those things could happen in DW or WoDu as well though. Really it is up to the MC/DM/GM judgment and the rules. And again if we are only talking about Apocalypse World and not DW\u2026 well, there is no charm spell, so I\u2019m not even sure how we\u2019d talk about it.<br/><br/>Dungon World has:<br/><br/>Charm Person Level 1 Enchantment<br/>The person (not beast or monster) you touch while casting<br/>this spell counts you as a friend until they take damage or<br/>you prove otherwise.<br/><br/>I\u2019m not seeing where the MC/GM decides \u201cbased on what is best for the story or is the most exciting thing to do\u201d in the spell description. I dunno, there are concrete rules in DW (and AW) too. *shrug*\n<blockquote>Is there a way to use the AW/WoDu rules in a way that the D&amp;D group I'm quoting here would find satisfactory? If so, how?</blockquote>\nGood question! So Mailer said:<br/><br/>1: Ogre starts in hostile disposition on the reaction table.<br/>2: Eowyn rolls + charisma modifier.<br/>3: On a leave result, ogre leaves but will consider Fellowship enemy and will attack if he sees them again. A friendly result would allow him to part on friendly terms, but he would likely not volunteer to join the group.<br/><br/>I\u2019d say: Eowyn rolls +cha for \u201cParley\u201d, yeah? With the leverage possibly being, \u201cif you leave we won\u2019t cast Charm on you again\u201d or whatever else the group has in their pockets and what they are hoping to get from the ogre.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420017/#Comment_420017" name="Item_172" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-13T22:44:43+00:00" title="August 13, 2013 10:44PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2013 10:45PM by David_Berg.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>However I do think that all of those things in your example could happen in Dungeon World or World of Dungeons.

This is what Dave has been talking about throughout: "However I do think that all of those things in your example could happen in Dungeon World or World of Dungeons." Sure, they could. They could also happen in a game of Primetime Adventures. But the way in which the player interacts with them is quite different in each of those scenarios: that's what I'm here to discuss.

My overwhelming feeling here is that people are operating under a limited interpretation of what it means to face challenges as a player, and how a game could be oriented around that goal. <br/><br/>For example, the idea that play can only have this goal if it is pursued rigorously or with meticulous tactical and strategic forethought on the part of the players seems unlikely to me. It seems to me that even if I don't want to map the dungeon square by square, or calculate the exact odds of risk vs. the exact odds of reward, I can still be primarily interested in dealing with challenges as presented in the fiction. I can have a limited set of tools and still be challenged by trying to use those tools for the best possible outcome.<br/><br/>Now there is still the question of whether AW is 'suited' or not, I guess. It seems to be it is better-suited to a form of challenge-based play that adopts a wider scope than a typical dungeon crawl (though we already have had several people specifically explain that they have used AW or AW-based games precisely for dungeon crawl style play.)<br/><br/>But really, AW is a game not about achievements but about consequences. And adjucating and communicating those consequences is largely in the hands of the MC, supported by an impressive infrastructure of Principles, Agendas, Fronts, etc. <i>It seems self-evident that you can have a challenge-based game where the characters always succeed at their immediate actions</i>; the challenge simply shifts elsewhere, to what sort of actions they choose to undertake, and in what contexts they choose to undertake them. IMO AW is exceptionally suitable to this sort of play, though it usually introduces these sorts of challenges with different overall goals in mind.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420045/#Comment_420045" name="Item_175" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-14T10:37:47+00:00" title="August 14, 2013 10:37AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, "challenge" definitely needs further specifying.  I suspect that's happened somewhere in here, but it's hard to keep track.<br/><br/>On the one hand, there's the sense in which all roleplay is challenging.  Beyond that, there's drama: in AW, I'm constantly challenged to explore and express my character and decide how he'd respond to various challenging situations.  And then all the way at the far end, there's pure tactical play.  I don't find dramatic AW play and highly tactical play to be remotely similar, but I guess there might be some place in the middle where play is a bit of one and a bit of the other.<br/><br/>Anyway, when I say "challenge-based play" I mean play that is more about tactics than it is about other stuff (including other types of challenge).

The scope at which AW naturally operates is more suited to mid-scale, consequence-based challenges than immediate-scale, achievement-based challenges; but surely both are valid modes of challenge-based play?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420054/#Comment_420054" name="Item_177" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-14T11:31:46+00:00" title="August 14, 2013 11:31AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 14, 2013 11:33AM by John_Harper.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder what you (Paul, David) think of the "free" (as opposed to "rigid") mode of classic Prussian officer training games (<i>kriegsspiel</i>). The rigid version of the game used dice to introduce random results to represent friction on the battlefield, and used fixed movement rates, static resolution rules, etc. But the "free" game mode replaced the dice with a referee (the 'confidant') who adjudicated all the results via principled decisions (based on his training and battlefield experience).<br/><br/>I doubt you would argue that the "free" mode of <i>kriegsspiel</i> is not a challenge-based game. Similar games are still used today by the military and private sector for simulation purposes, leveraging the judgment, insight, experience, and principles of a human referee to accommodate hugely complex tactical scenarios that would be overly time-consuming to automate.<br/><br/>(Indeed, the genesis of D&amp;D itself follows the same path, from rigid tabletop wargame with no referee, to a DM-adjudicated game relying on human judgment and interpretation. Did D&amp;D become a 'worse' challenge-based game when it evolved from Chainmail and introduced DM judgment? Of course not.)<br/><br/>I'm not saying that AW is a free-form game (obviously, it's not). I'm saying that, even purely free-form games -- that lack any of the features you're insisting upon -- are used extensively for both hardcore simulation and tactical challenge-based play. The core AW engine*, with its focus on fictional states and consequences and its robust support for a principled referee, is also perfectly suited to this kind of play.<br/><br/>*<b>Not</b> to be confused with default <i>Apocalypse World</i> play, which, we've all agreed does NOT focus on tactics. We're talking about <b>using the AW-engine</b> to play a tactically-focused game. I hope it's beginning to become apparent how it's not only possible to do this, but in some ways, for some players, it's preferable. Yes?

In a <i>kriegspiel</i>, there is a human referee who rules on the outcomes of various situations, which means that, instead of challenging the player to use the rules system to its utmost degree, the player is testing his wits against his opponent while the referee uses his experience to create fair and "realistic" outcomes. <br/><br/>However, note that here the referee is not the opponent. I think that if the referee was also the opponent (i.e. controlled the enemy's moves), we'd have a game that was still challenging for the player, but in a very different way: the referee can't meaningfully compete with the player, but rather makes simu-challenges and tries to the player that way. Ultimately, the combined referee/opponent decides how things turn out, whether in obvious, large-scale ways, or through a sequence of small, reasonable decisions.<br/><br/>AW, to me, is more like the latter (where the referee and the opponent are one and the same), whereas "old-school D&amp;D" is more like the <i>kriegspiel</i>, since it goes to great lengths to create objective levels of opposition (through modules/dungeons, random tables, and various methods or arbitrating outcomes), with the ideal intent of play being that the DM *only* has to arbitrate and adjudicate (i.e. referee), but not actually compete or create challenge for the players.<br/><br/>As a simple example, if in an OD&amp;D game the party comes up with a clever plan which bypasses every possible danger, they automatically succeed and reach the appropriate rewards. In a game of AW, however, the MC is instructed to keep making moves, regardless of what the fictional situation is. (Certainly the fictional positioning influences which moves are available and how hard they can be, but they're never going to disappear altogether in any form of AW play I've seen.)<br/><br/>Are we getting closer to being on the same page, or further apart? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>It's notable that I think *most* RPG play is more like the latter: not a true competition, but a simulacrum thereof. I find the AW framework skews towards this end, at least in my experience. I'm very open, though, to hearing good ways to change that tendency through various types of principled play, and we've already discussed a number in this thread, which has been awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420088/#Comment_420088" name="Item_179" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-15T00:06:28+00:00" title="August 15, 2013 12:06AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here are my thoughts on the most recent topics:<br/><br/>1) Principled freeform can be used for challenges.<br/><br/>2) Crunchy systems can also be used for challenges.<br/><br/>3) At challenge time, specific AW Moves and Principles get in the way of my freeform without providing me the benefits of crunch.<br/><br/>4) "The core AW engine" is not defined specifically enough in this thread to distinguish it from (a) the basic foundation of fiction focus and ref support that is decades old and for which an "AW" label is disingenuous, or (b) the bulk of AW, including some of the Moves and Principles I find unsuitable.  <br/><br/>Accordingly, it is impossible for me to say, or to know what anyone else means when they say, "the core AW engine supports challenge-based play".  That could mean little and be obvious, or it could mean much and I'd disagree.  <br/><br/>I would guess that "core engine" is both useless and needless terminology in this discussion.  We have the option to talk about specifics from actual games and actual play.<br/><br/>5) Details regarding which AW attributes get you which benefits in challenge-based play -- this is what I find most interesting at the moment.  Here are some I can think of:<br/><br/>- The <b>style of presenting principles</b> makes them easier to find and remember than traditional texts.<br/><br/>- A <b>dice mechanic that's trivial to remember and easy to calculate</b> minimizes the intrusion into the fiction.<br/><br/>- When someone is stumped for what should happen, the chance to <b>pick from a list</b> is a nice option.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/semiomant" title="semiomant"><img alt="semiomant" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/semiomant">semiomant</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420096/#Comment_420096" name="Item_180" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-15T04:25:54+00:00" title="August 15, 2013  4:25AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So there are signs/rules and ways in which they are interpreted (lets call that hermeneutics). Rules are a material, and as a material they have an inherent spin on how they progress/develop (known as "system matters"(sic)): that is why we ... um sorry ... I call a constellation of rules an "engine" - it is an impersonal instance that can be relied upon to drive play.<br/><br/>I can see how a certain hermeneutic of AW finds it very hard to understand how fictional positioning does not automatically entail player-centered drama, or even how rules can be there to facilitate rather than "intrude on" the fiction.<br/>What puzzles me is that in this hermeneutic there seems to be a need for long discussion if other hermeneutics of certain materials are valid.<br/><br/>Certainly the upside of this thread is that it shows how principles, more than a kind of GM advice, can be used as a tool to make the interpretation used for an engine explicit.<br/><br/>My own hermeneutic is as limited as anyone's, but makes it easy to extract abstract features of an engine, giving me pattern languages to improvise over.<br/><br/>Musically speaking, I am interested in jazz: fusion &amp; bebop.

In bad game design, the decisions are difficult or awkward: for instance, if I make you decide between rolling X number of dice or drawing cards from a deck, and there's no clear way to choose which is more suitable, but something important in the fiction depends on the decision.<br/><br/>Of course, this conversation is made quite difficult when we haven't defined our terms exactly: what is "the AW engine", what is "challenge-based play", and where do they intersect? What kinds of things do we want to challenge, and how?<br/><br/>One thing I keep running into is the AW MC's directive to "make moves" whenever it's her turn to talk. This is a bit of a problem for a player who is a) thinking primarily from a fiction-first perspective, and b) wants to minimize his exposure to risk. These two things don't go together well, and likely contradict each other. Maybe fictionally the smart thing to do is to sit in the middle of the corridor and wait. But now the MC has no clear way of handling the outcome: does she follow the flow of the game (and make a move), or does she reward the smart choice by having nothing (bad) happen?<br/><br/>Perhaps the <i>kriegspiel</i> comparison is also apt here: is the referee's job to always adjudicate in favour of the most likely result? (For instance, to consider the most likely outcome and skew towards that, aiming to get as close as possible to "realistic"? e.g An army which outnumbers their enemies and has a better position should always win.) Or is the referee's job to re-create the chaos and unpredictability of warfare, to challenge the players to react to unexpected results? (Sometimes even the cleverest plan goes South because someone screwed something up, or the weather changed all of a sudden, or someone got lucky: what are you going to do now?)<br/><br/>There's a lot of room here for different approaches.

Some of the moves are clearly less threatening: foreshadowing a future danger, for example. <br/><br/>If the player, engaging the fiction and not the dice, has avoided a risky course, then the MC is kinda obligated to choose a move that doesn't deal damage or immediately harm the character. That's how it works! If the player's totally fool-proof plan goes off without a roll, and everyone looks to the MC, then the MC looks at those moves and chooses only from applicable ones. In this case, the applicable ones are much more desirable to the character. Ta-da!

Whereas, in a pure Gamist kind of dungeon crawl, I think the possibility of "nothing happening" should be there, just as the possibility of a total instant TPK. It shouldn't be biased towards one or the other. I'm not sure how to meaningfully separate "make the PCs' lives interesting" from "adjudicate fairly" in this context.

The group just fast-forwards past all of that stuff. I mean, even in Apocalypse World it isn\u2019t like stuff is happening to the characters <b>ALL THE TIME</b>! Like they can\u2019t even take a shit without Doghead busting in and trying to kill them or Honda trying to steal their shit while their shitting or sleeping or fucking. Right? I mean off-screen the player characters actually get to eat without being shot at. Right?<br/><br/>The MC isn't literally making every-single-second of every-single-day EXCITING! We just focus on the parts that <i>are</i> exciting and fast-forward past the rest of the boring stuff. Yeah?<br/><br/>So we fast-forward past the group just sitting around, and being safe, and the GM decides/adjudicates, \u201chey now would be a great time to throw in a Wandering Monster\u201c. Or maybe even makes a custom Move for this. Then she rolls to see what monster it is (or even just decides) and says, \u201cafter a bit\u2026 [monster shows up]\u201d. Soft Move initiated.<br/><br/>The group still gets to decide how they react. The group is still being challenged. The GM still adjudicating fairly.<br/><br/>And in practically the same way as in OD&amp;D too. I mean behind the screen of an OD&amp;D DM there would be a roll every _blank_ Turns (dependant on the Dungeon, location in the dungeon, light sources, noise levels, and whatever else the DM wants to put in there in their individual ruling as to what is fair) to see if a monster shows up. But I think it would be fine to just say one shows up because the group is sitting around for a while.<br/><br/>In fact this is one of the many things that made OD&amp;D dungeons <i>raids</i> and not crawls -- if the group sat around they would just end up fighting a series of monsters and never getting any real loot (ie. experience points).<br/><br/>The resource management thing that David Berg brought up was good. Apocalypse World itself doesn\u2019t work like that really. But Dungeon World has resources to be spent: potions, hit points, gear, spells, whatever. And World of Dungeons being pretty much a blank slate can certainly do all of that!

They're different in each incarnation of an AW-engine game. (Same goes for the GM moves.) A challenge-based game would have new principles, too, of course -- like "respect tactical thinking", etc.\n<blockquote>As a simple example, if in an OD&amp;D game the party comes up with a clever plan which bypasses every possible danger, they automatically succeed and reach the appropriate rewards. In a game of AW, however, the MC is instructed to keep making moves, regardless of what the fictional situation is. (Certainly the fictional positioning influences which moves are available and how hard they can be, but they're never going to disappear altogether in any form of AW play I've seen.)</blockquote>\n<a href="/forums/profile/Scrape">@Scrape</a> already addressed this, but I will, too. Your AW example is not how I understand the game to work. Especially this -- <i>"the MC is instructed to keep making moves, regardless of what the fictional situation is"</i> -- totally not an AW rule; the opposite is true, in fact.<br/><br/>I think you think that the things you do when you run OD&amp;D aren't "gm moves." But they totally are. They're just from a somewhat different list. Hell, it isn't actually very different. Let's see.<br/><br/>The thief says she'll wait in the corridor while the goblins fight each other inside the room. Sounds smart! What does the GM say?<br/>1. "Okay. If you wait for a whole turn, I'll roll another wandering monster check. Still want to do it? Okay." (<i>tell them the possible consequences and ask</i> + <i>use a location move</i>)<br/><br/>2. "If you stand in the corridor, you aren't concealed. Want to look for a better spot?" (<i>tell them the possible consequences and ask</i> + <i>give an opportunity that fits a class ability</i>)<br/><br/>3. "You wait. You can hear them arguing inside, then loud crashing, then everything goes quiet. Seems all clear in there." (<i>offer an opportunity without a cost</i>)<br/><br/>(those are GM moves from Dungeon World, also using the <i>make a move that follows from the fiction</i> principle, among others)<br/><br/>In other words, the "GM moves" style of play is a type of <b>description</b> of "the things a GM does," not a separate, incompatible procedure from standard GM play. It's an innovation of notation (IMO) not execution. Everything you say when you run OD&amp;D is a "gm move" based on goals and principles -- we just haven't deconstructed it all into handy lists yet.<br/><br/>So: "Is AW suited to challenge-based play, <i>if I modify the GM agenda, principles, and moves to suit my particular vision for challenge-based play?</i>" Yes.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a>: Number 5 in your list is great to see. I'd add:<br/>- <b>Challenges don't have to be modeled with stats and numbers</b> (maybe HP for a monster) so they can be very quickly generated on the fly to suit the fictional situation.<br/><br/>- <b>The lack of mechanical detail</b> for stuff (gear, situational mods, no NPC stats) forces us to evaluate concrete fictional details to determine positioning, range of actions/outcomes. This supports challenge-based play as mastery of tactical thinking rather than mastery of game system choices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420143/#Comment_420143" name="Item_190" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-15T17:08:06+00:00" title="August 15, 2013  5:08PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for sticking with me, guys!\n<blockquote><br/>I\u2019m getting a wee bit frustrated because it feels like you *<b>Paul_T</b>* have an agenda that is something like:<br/>\u201cI will <i>disprove</i> that games that use the AW engine can be used for challenge-based-play\u201d.<br/></blockquote>\nOh, dear god no!

If you've got the entire text memorized and internalized, all you'd need to do is glance at your Agenda now and then, and that'll remind you which Principles to apply here. But of course you haven't memorized everything, so you look at your Principles and those remind me you which Moves you should be using. Let's say you're totally new to this whole gaming thing, though: you're looking at the Moves, which are written to explicitly fulfill your Principles, which are in turn written to fulfill the Agendas.<br/><br/>That's neat, right? Altering a few things on those lists will totally churn out a very different game. The Moves are probably the most generic and least-altered list, because they're usually just stuff that everyone does already.<br/><br/>But if you mess around with the lists, it's possible to write up a hack that is all confused because the Moves don't actually enforce the Principles, or the Principles don't enforce the Agenda. That's a serious issue, that's probably a bigger issue than broken math in the system.

This is true, but is there anything we can say about what AW <i>does</i> give you to replace those stats and numbers?  <b>A generic list of ways to threaten and inflict consequences on characters, which applies across diverse situations, and is easy to flesh in with appropriate specifics case by case</b>, perhaps?  I'm thinking of MC Hard Moves like "separate them".  <br/><br/>I'm actually not sure about this, though.  In one situation, "separate them" is not appropriate to what was risked or staked, and is unsatisfying.  In another situation, it's <i>obvious</i> that a failed character effort will result in characters being separated, and seeing "separate them" on a list doesn't add anything.  Should we focus on the in-between cases?<br/><br/>Maybe "list of threats &amp; consequences" is off point.  Maybe the point is "what attributes do challenges need, if not stats?"  In AW, is there a clear answer?  I can easily spot a few tools -- make a countdown clock, make a custom move -- that do remind me a little of statting up a simple encounter.   Besides those, I guess you have "pick a scarcity" + "pick a threat" + "pick an impulse", which adds up to <b>motive, color, possible action</b>.

Again, though, I don't need any help from AW to simply play without mechanical detail.  That option's been around forever.  What does AW add to it?<br/><br/>I don't have any answers to this one.

I bet if you took successful Vampire GMs and unsuccessful Vampire GMs, a lot of them would have gotten similar Agendas from all the "GM should pursue these goals" text (e.g. "create dark atmosphere") and have a similar awareness of the Moves available to them from the NPC and faction lists (e.g. "6th-gen prince demands something of you"), with the biggest difference being in the Principles that connect the two.  Coercive use of NPCs creates a dark atmosphere in a stifling way that can squash player agency.  Using NPCs to offer tough choices or opportunities, on the other hand, allows the players to bring the darkness themselves by going down the shady paths you tease.  Basically, the good GM has a sense of which Moves to use when, guided by Principles born of experience or intuition, while the bad GM grabs at Moves that seem fun in the moment but violate Principles that are vital to fun play.<br/><br/>This probably isn't news -- my first thought when I skimmed the AW MC stuff was "great for bad GMs; kinda irrelevant for good ones" -- but it seemed germane at this point.  Seeing as how I do not currently feel up to running a great Vampire game, I probably ought to go see if I can turn my good experiences with the game into a set of Principles.  Once I did that, I dunno if I'd then need to look at them, but I think creating the list would be quite instructive.<br/><br/>Pardon the tangent.  Returning to challenge-based play, I had a thought, that what I'd really like on top of the basic AW framework is some sort of method for managing fictional data.  Not stats and numbers, but truths and relationships.  The kind of stuff that would support people in playing the way John does (establish all relevant fictional particulars first, then roll only if needed) when they otherwise might not (e.g. roll first, sweat the details in the outcome narration).  I don't think a +2 to a roll for cleverness is specifically required, but I'd like some sort of reliable way to account for fiction-based problem-tackling.  Basically, a way to make the conversation with the GM about "definitely works / let's roll / couldn't work" less a vague matter of opinion and more a matter of interacting with established facts and probabilities.<br/><br/>Brainstorm:<br/><br/>Perhaps there could be some sort of Apply Knowledge procedure the players can invoke?<br/><br/><b>When you try something you haven't exactly done before, but think would work</b>, tell the MC all of the following reasons that apply:<br/>- Events from earlier in play that establish that this is how things work<br/>- Your real-life knowledge that this is how things work<br/><br/>MC, for each reason, go down this list in order:<br/>- Is there evidence present indicating why this wouldn't work?  If so, convey it to the players and see if they change their choice.<br/>- Is there a specific reason why this doesn't work, which the players haven't yet discovered?  If so, narrate how it doesn't work and call for an Analyze an Experiment roll; success means the players learn <i>why</i> it didn't work.<br/>- Is there a specific reason why this is dependent on luck or other factors, which the players haven't yet discovered?  If so, call for a roll of whichever Move applies.  Success (in addition to the attempt succeeding) reveals the previously unknown factor; failure (in addition to the attempt failing) invokes the Analyze roll above.<br/>- Is there a specific reason why this works and includes side-effects, either good or bad, beyond the players' intent?  If so, be sure to narrate those.<br/>- If none of the above, narrate the attempt succeeding exactly as the players hoped.<br/><br/>Rolling for multiple reasons:<br/>- All above rolls of the same Move become one roll.  The roll result simply determines how many successes are achieved.  10+ = 100%, 7-9 = 50%.  So if the players invoke 4 reason why an action should work, and all 4 are doomed for hidden reasons, one Analyze roll is made, with a 7-9 revealing 2 of these hidden reasons.<br/><br/>So, um, that may be practically unfeasible, but maybe it demonstrates the sort of feedback I have in mind, and someone else will have a smoother idea...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420303/#Comment_420303" name="Item_204" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-18T07:32:53+00:00" title="August 18, 2013  7:32AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why are we rolling to reveal why a plan won't work?

As for implementation, yeah, that brainstorm might not be so hot!  If you can get on board with the objectives I'm pursuing, I'm happy to hear better options!<br/><br/>As for what I had in mind with the brainstorm above:<br/><br/><span style="color: #002280;">The killbot is marching down the corridor toward my injured PC.  My taser will be no good against this menace.  However, the corridor is littered with the bodies of Coalition guardsmen, who carry standard issue plasma rifles.  I point my taser at one of the rifles, planning to overload its power cell and cause a plasma explosion as soon as the killbot's nearest to the rifle.<br/><br/>MC: That's the <b>try something you haven't done before</b> move!  Why do you think that will work?<br/><br/>Me: In that earlier scene with Xer going through the armory, he mentioned these rifles are volatile.  Also, when Ty kept his taser on the Colation grid long enough, the grid overloaded.  And third, I know from real life that plasma is charge-sensitive.<br/><br/>MC: Cool. (MC checks down the list.  Obvious reasons why these don't apply, to tell me immediately?  For example, rifles are too far away for my taser to hit?  MC sees no such reasons.)  Alright, could work!  You do it?<br/><br/>Me: Yep!<br/><br/>MC: Alright.  One sec.  (Looking down the list, the MC sees no reasons why the taser charge wouldn't build up and why the plasma wouldn't be charge-sensitive.  However, regarding rifle volatility, the MC does note that these guns are designed with shielding so that the Coalition borgs who sometimes carry them don't get fried by stray electric discharge from their cyber crap.  In order to overload a plasma cell, the shielding would first have to be breached.  If I had thought to say, "I put a bullet in the plasma rifle first," then that would work, but since I didn't, it probably won't.)  Okay Dave, you taser the gun, and as the killbot marches by, there are sparks and stuff flying off the casing but no explosion.<br/><br/>Me: Crap!  Maybe the charge didn't get to the cell?<br/><br/>MC: Let's see if you can tell!  Roll to <b>analyze an experiment</b>!<br/><br/>SUCCESSFUL ROLL VERSION:<br/>Me: 8!<br/><br/>MC: You spot one reason that accounts for the failure.  Just like you guessed, the charge didn't get to the plasma cell, and that's because the shielding around it is intact.<br/><br/>Me: Quick, before the killbot gets to me, I'll shoot the next plasma rifle in front of it, and then tase that one!<br/><br/>MC: It works!  KA-BOOM!<br/><br/>FAILED ROLL VERSION:<br/>Me: 5!  Crap!<br/><br/>MC: It's not clear why that didn't work.  If you had time to test theories, you'd clear it up, but there's no time for that now!<br/><br/>Me: If I crack the cell shielding, might that work?<br/><br/>MC: You don't know of any reason why it wouldn't...<br/><br/>Me: Well, it's worth a shot!  Quick, before the killbot gets to me, I'll shoot the next plasma rifle in front of it, and then tase that one!<br/><br/>MC: It works!  KA-BOOM!</span><br/><br/>Again, I'm not in love with this per se (I'd enjoy the failed roll example more than the success example, because I figured it out myself, rather than making a roll to see if my fictional dude is observant), but I do like the way the "try something" move and checklist supports the above conversation.  With less support, the MC and I might not navigate my problem-solving in a way that I find as satisfying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420317/#Comment_420317" name="Item_208" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-18T18:43:10+00:00" title="August 18, 2013  6:43PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            FAILED ROLL VERSION:<br/>Me: 5!

I dunno if you guys are actually interested in the thing I'm interested in, but for whoever is, maybe I can clarify:<br/><br/>Judd's example, through the lens of Dave's preferred style of challenge-based gaming:<br/><b>1)</b> There is no difference between me being clever enough to pierce the plasma shielding and me not being clever enough.  <i>That difference</i> is specifically what I'm looking to support.<br/><b>2)</b> My common sense regarding weaponry tells me that this chain reaction outcome is nonsense (which would be awful if true -- you can't problem-solve a fiction that doesn't obey expected laws), but let's instead say the MC has a good in-fiction reason for it.  I want to know that reason!  Should I have known already, and was this a strategic failure on my part, for which I'm paying the price?  Or is this brand new info, which I can add to my bag of knowledge for future use if only I can acquire it?  Those are the only two valid options.<br/><b>3)</b> "Presence of guards = presence of shields" is simple recall; that's a memory challenge, not an application challenge.  Boo.<br/><b>4)</b> Zeroing in on assets within a field of data <i>is</i> part of the plasma rifle challenge, but I'm fine having the MC do the recall bit for me.  If I ask "what's in the corridor?" and the answer is "walls, ductwork, ladder, outlets, corpses with rifles", it's still on me to think of a way to use one of those, based on sound logic and knowledge.  <br/><b>5)</b> "Given the presence of stuff that includes shields, can you find cover?" is a lame challenge because "shield as cover" is obvious.  <br/><b>6)</b> "Taser the plasma rifle", on the other hand, is <i>not</i> an obvious solution to "trapped with armored foe approaching".  (At least, not the first time.  That's why my move specifies "try something you <i>haven't done before</i>" -- once you're in the habit of blowing up plasma rifles, it's simply a thing you can do and not a challenge with opportunities for learning.)<br/><b>7)</b> In summary: When I survey my tools, compose my options, and choose one for the situation -- if I choose poorly, based on ignorant hope, I want that to just plain not work.  Why?  So that it feels rewarding the next time when I'm on the ball, choosing based on knowledge and logic, and shit <i>does</i> work.  That means I <i>earned</i> it.  That's kind of the entire point of playing in this specific way (challenge-based fiction-first).  Or, at least it's <i>my</i> favorite part.\n<blockquote>The analyze move seems superfluous to the action</blockquote>Yep!  I'm more concerned with the tactically relevant info than dramatic pacing here.  The action can wait if it needs to.

I'm totally on the same page, for what it's worth.<br/><br/>The "analyze" move could work without a roll, of course, as Matt points out. I'm not sure if it would be better without a roll, though. (It's a question of whether there are enough different possible outcomes which are all fun, or just or two.)<br/><br/>When you try a plan and it fails in AW, it's basically time for the MC to make a move. I feel the AW moves are a really great encapsulation of the kind of stuff that a good GM can say in order to respond to that and move the game along.  As Dave points out, it doesn't help you at all to gauge the level of challenge/threat and calibrate your responses to player cleverness<br/><br/>Judd's response to Dave's situation, with all the rifles exploding, is a perfect example of why AW is generally a better game/more fun than doing it in the way Dave describes. But sometimes you want a different type of game, where the players not being clever enough (or whatever) DOES mean that play essentially stalls (or suffers in some other way). The risk of that happening is part of what establishes the stakes present in the game.<br/><br/>It's kind of like playing a game where the protagonists can't die except in dramatically appropriate circumstances (e.g. Dogs in the Vineyard, TSoY, etc) is a good fit for an exciting, emotionally moving game.

The risk of that happening is part of what establishes the stakes present in the game.</blockquote>\nOkay, I get that, but I'm not sure how it relates to challenge-based play. The MC making a move in Judd's example seems like it's just the game moving on to the next challenge. Challenge-based play doesn't mean 'if you don't succeed at every challenge, play stops' -- or at least, it doesn't seem to need to mean that? And ideally doesn't mean that? It seems to me that a game based around legitimate challenges to the players needs to handle the possibility of failure gracefully, and one graceful way of dealing with a challenge that players cannot surmount is to move on in the fiction. I'm not eliminated from a game of tennis the first time I miss a shot, nor do we keep giving me the ball over and over from the same position until I make that exact shot. We just acknowledge that I failed to rise to that particular challenge, and move on to the next one.<br/><br/>Is the idea here that the kind of challenge-based play you're talking about requires a certain amount of trial-and-error to feel effective? Is there something about these challenges or this style of play that requires a situation to be repeatable, or testable, or something? Is having multiple attempts at a challenge -- and, like, the exact same challenge, not the same type of challenge -- important?<br/><br/>I can see how having these more drawn-out back-and-forths around a particular situation could, for example, be a way of building up player knowledge about the world and its consequences. The less variables are changing, the easier it is to determine/discover what is actually going on (i.e. that these plasma guns are shielded from electricity). And (maybe?) the more likely that players will absorb the same information about how the game world works. But this mostly feels like a sub-genre of challenge-based play, which is like, I dunno, 'empirical-experimental challenge-based play' or something.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420381/#Comment_420381" name="Item_218" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-19T19:27:27+00:00" title="August 19, 2013  7:27PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 19, 2013 7:38PM by David_Berg.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lotsa stuff to think about here.  I've kind of given up on nailing down the definitions of any broader sense of fiction-first challenge-based play, so I'll just respond based on my personal preferences.  I hope piecemeal isn't annoying:\n<blockquote>It seems to me that you're concerned that in absence of detailed mechanics, the GM's heavy level of judgment might endanger tactical play, right? Like, in the right hands, the AW system can be open and fair but with the wrong MC it's essentially fiat. Is that your concern?</blockquote>Sort of.  I think it's more specific than "open and fair" vs "wrong fiat".  You don't need to be a bad MC in general to be bad at connecting the dots between challenge and reward.  I'd rather make those connections either (a) as easy as possible for the MC to make, or (b) present in rules so the MC needn't worry about them.  Judd's example MC is a great AW MC, just not an appropriate challenge-rewarder.\n<blockquote>Does it matter if the GM knows beforehand how this works? Would they have had to have made up something about the plasma rifle casings before you tried this</blockquote>It matters to me.  I certainly prefer it, so as to avoid competing impulses, and also to avoid the <i>fear</i> of competing impulses.  (Any player who's ever had a GM tell them "no, that doesn't work" because the GM was trying to keep the plot on the rails, can get understandably paranoid.)  However, I don't think "knows the exact answer to this specific situation" is a hard requirement.  I think that's the best option, but when it's unfeasible (in the case of "oh geez, I'd never thought about this thing that's just now coming up!"), I think there are others that suffice.\n<blockquote>or would it have to have come up in play before for it to be meaningful?</blockquote>I think the players need to have knowledge that <i>applies</i> but not necessarily knowledge that is <i>conclusive</i>.  In other words, although it would be coolest if I'm putting two known puzzle pieces together (taser overloads hardware + plasma cells explode) in a way that becomes obvious once I've thought of it (overloaded cell explodes!), it's also pretty cool if I can try stuff that I'm less certain of.  <br/><br/>For example, let's say it hasn't come up before in play that my taser can overload hardware or that plasma rifles are volatile, but it <i>has</i> come up in play before that lightning can overload hardware and that tank plasma cannons are volatile.  So, in that case, what I'm doing by tasering the rifle is not just applying known facts, but also applying known <i>logic and patterns</i>.  <br/><br/>Hopefully, in playing my character in the game world, I've developed a sense of how things work, and this is my metric for guessing that a taser works like lightning and a plasma rifle works like a plasma cannon.  The rule here, I guess, would be "<i>type of energy</i> is very important, and consistently relevant".  This is something I might get from prior play, or from the GM, or from a setting book.<br/><br/>Beyond that, there's also a dose of real-world knowledge, common sense, and risk/reward assessment.  "This intuitively seems like it might work, and I don't have any better ideas, so let's try it!" is still a form of tactical problem-solving, assuming my intuition is informed by a logic of play that actually applies.\n<blockquote>It feels like feeling successful is about guessing the GM's made-up stuff about plasma rifle casings.</blockquote>That sounds awful to me, but for only one reason: it sounds arbitrary.  If it's <i>not</i> arbitrary, then I have no problem with the GM, rather than the weapons table on page 1125, being the one to define how rifle casings work.  If the GM is deciding this according to the same principles I use to strategize, then the possibility that we will come to different conclusions is identical to the in-fiction possibility that my character's knowledge is incomplete and he will guess wrong.<br/><br/>If you look over the move I wrote up, you'll see this: if there isn't a <i>specific reason</i> why the characters' attempt <i>doesn't</i> work, then it <i>does</i> work.  In my example above, the MC isn't deciding based on having previously played through this exact situation, but he isn't deciding based on whim either.  "Can't have Coalition borgs getting fried by stray discharges" suits the <i>logic</i> the players and MC share -- in this case, "the fiction is the way it is for reasons of physics and rational agents."  The Coalition isn't dumb or crazy enough to overlook a physical property such as weapons that blow up around high-voltage combat.<br/><br/>So, as a player, I may pass through a moment where I'm like "Why the fuck didn't that work?"  But when I discover the answer, I am <i>happy</i> that it didn't work.  The answer is consistent with, and bolsters, my vision of the fictional world.  That vision is then the primary tool I use in tactical decisions.  The strategist in me hears this and thinks, "Holy shit, if I can sneak into their armory and sabotage the shielding, <i>I can take out a Borg army</i>."  The GM's arbitration just handed me that possibility.<br/><br/>Of course, all this is <i>much</i> more satisfying when I <i>do</i> in fact find out why something didn't work.  The rest of my brainstorm detailed ways in which this knowledge could be pursued and obtained.

I was simply calling attention to the fact that "there's relevant info to be gained here" and opening that up to being a fun pursuit in its own right.<br/><br/>There certainly doesn't have to be a die roll.  In some fictional situations, my character could just run experiments until the answer is clear.  Rolling for knowledge then would suck.  The Savvyhead's workspace rules would be way better.  <br/><br/>In other situations, involving limited resources such as time, experimental subjects, hit points to lose in failed attempts, etc., I'd prefer to use my own cleverness than simply leave it to dice luck.  I suspect that might just be another (or a series of) "try something you haven't done before" moves.  Or maybe a roll would be a nice way to speed through this... I'm not sure.\n<blockquote><b>When you need answers to determine a course of action, tell the MC your plan.

That's actually one of the 3 main "moves" in my game Delve, combined with the first GM principle.  Different style of presentation, though.  Interesting!  Anyway, yeah, I was assuming this, and moving on to stuff characters couldn't determine easily.\n<blockquote><b>When you need answers and it's not something obvious, roll +stat.

"What do I know and observe that might help me here?" can be solved in a number of ways.  For Delve I use an <b>"I look for [something specific]"</b> "move" (so the player needs to generate ideas and the GM never just solves situations for them) and that seems to work.

I am totally with AW on "abide by truth/prep/principles", and I only like GM-as-adversary in very tightly rules-based games, not fiction-based ones.  I'm no longer talking about conflicts, I was just poking at the "tune it to support different play goals" step.  Do you have any opinions on my brainstormed procedures?  If you don't think they add much (or have too many downsides), can you think of better ways to accomplish similar "support this play style" goals?<br/><br/>Here they are again, in case I've buried them with too much verbiage:<br/><br/><b>When you try something you haven't exactly done before, but think would work</b>, tell the MC all of the following Reasons that apply:<br/>- Events from earlier in play that establish that this is how things work<br/>- Your real-life knowledge that this is how things work<br/><br/>MC, for each Reason, go down this list in order:<br/>- Is there evidence present indicating why this wouldn't work? If so, convey it to the players and see if they change their choice.<br/>- Is there a specific reason why this doesn't work, which the players haven't yet discovered? If so, narrate how it doesn't work and call for an Analyze an Experiment roll; success means the players learn why it didn't work.<br/>- Is there a specific reason why this is dependent on luck or other factors, which the players haven't yet discovered? If so, call for a roll of whichever Move applies. Success (in addition to the attempt succeeding) reveals the previously unknown factor; failure (in addition to the attempt failing) invokes the Analyze roll above.<br/>- Is there a specific reason why this works and includes side-effects, either good or bad, beyond the players' intent? If so, be sure to narrate those.<br/>- If none of the above, narrate the attempt succeeding exactly as the players hoped.<br/><br/>Rolling for multiple Reasons:<br/>- All above rolls of the same Move become one roll. The roll result simply determines how many successes are achieved. 10+ = 100%, 7-9 = 50%. So if the players invoke 4 reason why an action should work, and all 4 are doomed for hidden reasons, one Analyze roll is made, with a 7-9 revealing 2 of these hidden reasons.<br/><br/><b>Analyze an experiment:</b> only roll for this when the situation involves limited resources such as time, experimental subjects, hit points to lose in failed attempts, etc.  Otherwise, you <i>will</i> succeed, but ask the MC what's required first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420461/#Comment_420461" name="Item_226" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-20T20:53:13+00:00" title="August 20, 2013  8:53PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just don't see what the "rolling for hidden reasons" is about.

They use some D&amp;D resource rules (character levels are a thing), but most of the engine is my friend generating and arbitrating opportunities and obstacles.  There are a lot of random tables involved, but many are used to track progress of situations that players have created, so it's largely in the realm of consequences, not pure chance.  I'm currently talking to him about the principles he uses, and hopefully I can report back here once we've gotten somewhere.  It'll be a while, though.  In the meantime, I'd still love to hear others folks' thoughts.\n<blockquote>"When you put your thinking cap on, tell the MC what you're trying to achieve. They will tell you what it will take, using conditions from the following list."</blockquote>Are you talking about instead of my <b>analyze</b> move (in which case, agreed, good option) or instead of my <b>try something new</b> move (in which case I can rant about why that's a horrible option)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420868/#Comment_420868" name="Item_234" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-29T11:49:04+00:00" title="August 29, 2013 11:49AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello, everyone.
