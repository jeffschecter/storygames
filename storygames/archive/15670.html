I'm up next with In A Wicked Age. I remember a while ago quite a few threads on play advice for this, but a search doesn't seem to be pulling them up, and I guess there might also be some new advice folks might have. I've read the rules questions threads and have a pretty clear idea of the no-stake-setting advice for it (and I think playing Fiasco for the last three weeks should help us make Best Interests suitably entangled!) but is there anything else I should watch for?<br/><br/>I seem to half-remember some advice about aiming to do a chapter in an hour of play? Should I be pitching for that, or is that just some crazed speed-playing hack?<br/><br/>Also, anyone recommend any alternative setting hacks. The group as a whole is big into Cthulhu, Space Opera, and Wuxia (in varying combinations) so are there any IaWA oracles folks have had fun with? Like, there's loads on Abulafia, but are they any good?<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><br/>Guy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355273/#Comment_355273" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-21T14:09:21+00:00" title="January 21, 2012  2:09PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Once upon a time, I took it upon myself to make a FAQ on the story games wiki, which in turn links back to some great threads:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/codex/index.php?title=In_a_Wicked_Age" rel="nofollow">http://www.story-games.com/codex/index.php?title=In_a_Wicked_Age</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355274/#Comment_355274" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-21T14:13:54+00:00" title="January 21, 2012  2:13PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And Ry's website seems to be down!

If you're the GM, stick to the advice in the book that says your NPCs' best interests should:<br/>-threaten a PC on some level<br/>-never ever threaten a NPC<br/>Help the players create good BIs, too. <br/><br/>It's not a bad idea to drive the game to conflict rather aggressively at times. If you've got two characters at the table that want the same thing, put them together in a room, with the thing there. If a character wants something with or from someone, and the other doesn't, give the former an opportunity. Etc. <br/><br/>But like the book says, all conflict all the time is boring, too. Sometimes just circle around it, let it go on for a bit, let everyone roleplay. But don't be sheepish about moving in for the kill, or giving other opportunities to move. That's how We Owe ranks are gained, that's how the story moves forward, that's how interests get resolved, that's how the gripping fiction happens.<br/><br/>Oh, and finally, read the dice resolution rules a few times before play. Maybe create a cheat sheet or something about all the little nuances. Maybe it's just me but it's not one of Vincent's best texts in that regard. Pleasant to read through but a nightmare to reference in case you forget something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355332/#Comment_355332" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-22T13:21:09+00:00" title="January 22, 2012  1:21PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Make sure to tell the players the game is most fun when they are in conflicts with each other.

I ran the the Grain Peddler mission first (it sorta fell a bit flat... they rolled well and never met the snake) and then spent two minutes designing a mission getting them to rescue the Grain Peddler's wife and family who had been kidnapped to force him to transport the map... it was sorta OK but I think it was a bit obvious I was pulling NPCs, the plot, everything, out of my ass as I went along.<br/><br/>(2) is that, if you've got ready-to-go con games (with pregens) and a box set with lots of play aids in, you should bring them AS WELL as the main rulebook if you're bringing a "backup game". Those cards would've made it a lot easier... hell, character sheets would've made it a lot easier.<br/><br/>Maybe I'll come back to IaWA soon - in the meantime, I need to show them what MG looks like when I <b>actually plan to run it</b>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Millsy" title="Millsy"><img alt="Millsy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Millsy">Millsy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375471/#Comment_375471" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T10:12:19+00:00" title="May  1, 2012 10:12AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry for self-necromancing this thread, but, last night, I actually did run In A Wicked Age for the group! Ry's flowchart was really useful, as was the advice from this page that I could remember. We had a wizened old crone who could foretell the future, an outcast with an entourage of crows, and a mind-controlling bloodthirsty shortsword, all thrown together amongst the lich-king's army on the blasted desert. My own self-evaluation of how I ran:<br/><br/>1. Two of the three players seemed to grasp the antagonistic nature of play much quicker than the third, although he got it by the end, which sometimes felt a bit... awkward. <br/><br/>2. We had a few moments of GM/player authority confusion - I guess we've been playing Fiasco a lot lately, and I wasn't really on the ball with the "scene framing is MY job" part of it. Which led to...<br/><br/>3. I didn't really start with conflict - I sorta asked the players where they were (that's mistake 2., again) at the start, and they put themselves in relative safety going about their day-to-day business. This meant I had to drag them pretty aggressively towards conflict and have my NPCs be pretty active to push them between their best interests. I think I could've started with much more status shift to the PCs and made my job a bit easier later on - we certainly had a good 30-40 minutes of play that wasn't really on fire as we manoeuvred slowly towards the inevitable mayhem.<br/><br/>We're probably playing next week, where the seer is on the Owe List and should get another outing, and I'll let you know how I get on with my own targets above!<br/><br/>Strangely enough, I had prepped to run Monsterhearts for this session (might account for 3., above) - I'm making a habit of running different games to what I plan, not sure that is a good thing!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Millsy" title="Millsy"><img alt="Millsy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Millsy">Millsy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375472/#Comment_375472" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T10:13:14+00:00" title="May  1, 2012 10:13AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and we ran to about 2 hours for our chapter (GM &amp; three players), by my reckoning... in case anyone was wondering.

When I run it at cons, I two 2 hour chapters in a 4 hour slot. Each chapter is locked at 2 hours as a result. It sings.  A couple of times I've screwed up my accounting and gave 2 hours for the first chapter after character creation and ended up with only 90 minutes for the second chapter. It usually gets too rushed.<br/><br/>I'm not saying it can't work in under 2 hours, but it's been hit or miss for me.<br/><br/>Though, I usually have some players who have never played. When your group knows the rules and the rhythm of the game more intuitively, it might be a different story. But that second chapter happens with the 1st chapter having stumbling a bit with rules learning. So I'm pretty confident that 2 hours is the sweet spot if the chapter doesn't come to a conclusion sooner on its own (I've never seen this happen)<br/><br/>(edit: fixed a grammer issue I noticed once it got quoted)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376275/#Comment_376275" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-03T18:10:00+00:00" title="May  3, 2012  6:10PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jogesh EZ</cite>When I run it at cons, I two two chapters in a 4 hour slot.</blockquote>\nI do exactly this, and point out early on that the multi-chapter nature means you don't have to get absolutely everything perfect during setup.<br/><br/>Setup is actually the least good part of this game. The best IAWA chapter is always 3 or later, because the setup for those chapters are so organic and flow from things the players have actually demonstrated their interest in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
