I was planning on writing up some background NPCs tonight over my lunch break, but I just remembered that I haven't had time to take a lunch break at work but like once a week or so. So anyway, here's the setup:<br/><br/>You don't need to know jack or shit about L5R to participate. Here's the situation:<br/>The wall has stood for centuries, protecting the land from the cursed Shadowlands. Think the Great Wall, which gets breached here and there with zombies which have to be fought back. There's an outpost along the wall called "Kaiseki Point" which is about to get overrun big time. The wall will fall, the Shadowlands will spill into the land, and everyone will have to deal with the consequences.<br/><br/>Locations for the first few scenarios will be:<br/>*Kaiseki Point, which is situated on a hill with crazy hidden caves. Imagine a military outpost, or small castle in Europe with a small town near it.<br/>*Southern Ten is the large city about a day and a half north of Kaiseki point (walking, a few hours by horse). <br/>I haven't defined them at all, save for a few mental images.<br/><br/>The PCs will include (and they will most likely all be Protagonists. Maybe):<br/>*A strong, brash armored warrior with a lot to prove. Ostracized because he married into another family, his old and new family both don't have a lot of respect for him.<br/>*A clever young warrior from the North (the "Lion", where everyone else is "Crab"), who was sent to the South to learn their ways, and to do sort of a cultural/war exchange. He learns how to fight in exchange for protecting the wall for a tour of duty.<br/>*A mysterious sorcerer, with connections in the magical realms far and wide (who has a powerful mentor)). Also, a calligraphy artist.<br/>Now, personalities of these "protagonists" are largely undefined right now. We'll probably see that more as we define the situation further, and create "NPCs" for them to react with/against.<br/><br/>Here are my current list of Antagonists and Anchors:<br/><br/>". . ."<br/><br/>So, as you can see, I need help. In fact, doubly so, because when I wrote the above that was before I hopped on a high priority customer issue that will probably keep me busy for the rest of my work day with no reprieve.<br/><br/>At least one Antagonist is going to some kind of mystical evil presence from the Shadowlands.<br/><br/>But I need some memorable NPCs with interesting personalities. You don't have to know L5R (clans, etc) to participate. Just think "medieval Japanese city" or "medieval Japanese military outpost", propose a character or two, and I'll handle integration with the L5R junk. I'll have the players link themselves to this "pool" of characters in the two towns.<br/><br/>I'm looking for a kind of character (merchant, courtesan, liutenant, police chief, gambler-samurai, mob boss), likely location of this character (the outpost or the city), a personality trait or two, and perhaps a motivation or two. I need "good guys", "anchors/neither good nor bad", and maybe 1-2 "bad guys" (but not so horribly evil that the characters will want to kill them at first site/vice versa). I'll come up with names for the characters and the like.<br/><br/>HELP! <br/>and, THANKS!<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128001/#Comment_128001" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T10:07:05+00:00" title="February 20, 2008 10:07AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>do sort of a cultural/war exchange.</blockquote>\nThe guy he exchanged with, who is a huge jackass, and who is now home and has brought his new (Lion, whatever) wife with him.

Helpful Japanese girl to the extreme. She's the advance guard for the Shadowlands - spy and assassin. The problem is, she doesn't know she's been 'hacked' by the Shadowlands. She's corrupt and doesn't know it. When protecting her, if they choose to do so, she shows as a huge red blip on a Shadowlands' senses. If killed, either for her own good or because she goes off the deep end, all her corruption flows into her murderer. She might realize this when on the innocent side of the coin, and, if so, who did she kill to become like she is?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128040/#Comment_128040" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T11:19:25+00:00" title="February 20, 2008 11:19AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the purest wuxia tradition:<br/>The sorcerer's mentor had this competent and wise rival.

Been busy as hell at work. So what I did was the Magical Formula that worked great in our With Great Power/Night Watch game: An R-Map consisting of a bunch of blobs, loosely formed and not defined.<br/><br/>First off, though, I said: I've got a list of NPCs. Pick one to tie yourself to, then I'll bring that connection in in the next 2 adventures. I started reading off the list, pretty much right from this thread.<br/><br/>Hilarious moment:<br/><br/>I read this:<br/>"<b>There's this kid, a scrappy little urchin dude</b>..." I got that far, and IMMEDIATELY, in sync, Travis points his finger at Tim. Tim points his finger at Matthew. Matthew points his finger at Travis.<br/>Matthew was the last to point, tho, so he got the scrappy kid. It honestly wasn't just as simple as that, Travis and Matthew actually came up with good reasons (both in the background of the setting, and "for the drama") why they would get the kid, and I tagged Travis with that one (the Crab of Two Families).<br/><br/>Other than that, I went through the list until each player had a tag to later get involved. The rest are all going in the game. ALL OF THEM. In some form or other. Many of them will be in the City, where the players will likely be in the next 1-2 sessions (the City is a day away from the Outpost, or a few hours on horse, so it's basically just a scene-wipe away).<br/><br/>I combined Tristan's and Jason's Sorcerer into one entity, a female sorcerer, once studied under the crab sorcerer's master, but was kicked out (physically!). Now she's mysteriously working at the outpost, and "randomly" showing up where the sorcerer is. What is her mystery, and how will things develop between the two? (this will be awesome).<br/><br/>The characters began the session recovering from the fight in the last one: The wizard had words with the warrior for telling him to "flee". "I am a *Crab*. We Do Not Flee." A guard garrison shows up to assist and investigate the area, and the captain walks the PCs the last mile to the outpost. At the outpost, the story started taking off. I decided since the captain was around longer than expected, to make him into Rafael's Sane Tsutomu (but I gave him a diff't name). He is now tied to all three PCs, but closer to the Crab Bushi. <br/>After a lot of investigating and setting up in the town, the PCs retired to the tavern (the first rule of the outpost is "Everyone Must Rest for their First Day. EVERYONE."). The Lion bushi walked into the healer's in the middle of a child birth. He helped deliver the baby, and became drinking buddies with the husband, a ronin (A version of Rafael's Kosugi Hideo). The game ended after some more conversations in the tavern, wandering the town, and getting "Quest Leads".<br/><br/>Again, as I mentioned, ALL of your NPC suggestions will be either used or incorporated (of if you suggested more than one, at least one). I'll definitely come back after 3 sessions or so and post the final list, including names and how they were used, and update it as things change. <br/><br/>In short, great ideas folks, you helped me out, and gave me some great story leads too!<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue" title="Rob Donoghue"><img alt="Rob Donoghue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/tinyhat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue">Rob Donoghue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129216/#Comment_129216" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T11:57:30+00:00" title="February 22, 2008 11:57AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steal from game of thrones.<br/><br/>The clans in l5R are very easy to map to great houses of the Song of Ice and Fire in theme, but it so far removed in content that the simple act of transplanting a character from one to the other will make it unique, distinctive and awesome.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129222/#Comment_129222" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T12:09:15+00:00" title="February 22, 2008 12:09PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rob Donoghue</cite>Steal from game of thrones.</blockquote>\nActually, that is a running joke at our table to Monty Python proportions.

Good question!  I'll think about it for a day, then come back here and post about it in a new thread. It's basically a collection of tools/ideas from a few RPGs (most notably With Great Power) that just totally worked for us in the last campaign I ran, so I kinda made them into a formula and went with it for this L5R game.  I'll post in a new thread tomorrow, and link to it from here.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136214/#Comment_136214" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-24T20:26:02+00:00" title="March 24, 2008  8:26PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome!
