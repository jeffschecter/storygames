Getting what I'm saying here may rely upon your knowing the game, but fortunately I have released the <a href="http://misspentyouthgame.com/misspentyouthashcan.pdf" rel="nofollow">ashcan version</a> (pdf) of the game for free online. So you can read and follow along.<br/><br/>Today I'm going to talk about a rule I used in the <a href="http://glyphpress.com/talk/?p=568" rel="nofollow">series</a> I played with Kat Jones, <a href="http://glyphpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Joshua A. C. Newman</a>, and Evan Torner. <a href="http://hamsterprophet.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Nathan Paoletta</a> and <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/designmatters/Eppy.html" rel="nofollow">Epidiah Ravachol</a> both noticed that the game might benefit from more choice-making during the conflict system. Thus, these rules (possibly optional, possibly in the core rules) to re-roll one die during a conflict.<br/><br/>So, the way conflicts in MY work now, the Youthful Offender (YO) rolling rolls 2d6, adds the total, and if he doesn't hit a number already claimed by the Authority or another YO, he puts a chip down and claims that number and narrates how he got closer to the stakes using one of his traits. This continues until someone hits a claimed number. If that claimed number belongs to the YOs, they win. If it belongs to the Authority, then <i>he</i> wins. If the YO who rolled the failure wishes, he can sell out one of his traits and steal a victory.<br/><br/>So, right now, there's not much tactical decision making. I'm kind of ok with that. I mean, you're impulsive kids, right? In the current rules as written, the only tactical decision you're making is whether you can risk having to sell out (or choose not to). To me, that's alright because the story-pressure aspects of the game are far more interesting than the tactical ones to me. However, we tried this new rule in the above-mentioned series and we found it fun.<br/><br/><b>So here's the fucking rule, already:</b> On the second and all other future rolls, if you do not roll a failure or a success, you may choose to re-roll one of your two dice to get a better number. Here's how it works:\n<ol><li>Pick a trait and describe how you make an attempt to do something with that trait, but then change your mind in frustration. You may not use this trait again for this conflict; it's as if you claimed a number with it in that respect.</li><li>Choose one of your dice and re-roll it.<ol><li>If you win, you win.</li><li>If you claim an open number, you claim an open number as usual, narrating the claim with a different trait from the one you used earlier.</li><li><b>If you lose</b>, you may <i>not</i> sell out any traits for a win. You've lost the conflict, irrevocably</li></ol></li></ol>\nAs I said, I'm not yet sure if I'll make this a "full" rule, or if it'll be an optional one. Tell me what you think. Do you like the rule? Should it be optional or standard?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191958/#Comment_191958" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-10T15:28:48+00:00" title="February 10, 2009  3:28PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, one of my favorite things about MY was the fact that the conflict resolution <i>could not be gamed at all</i>.

First, I'll give the rule, then I'll talk about some of the reasons for it. The text below is written in a voice directed at the Authority player.<br/><br/>First, ditch the planning phase rules found in the <a href="http://misspentyouthgame.com/misspentyouthashcan.pdf" rel="nofollow">ashcan</a>.<br/><br/>Next, describe to the table the purpose of the Exposition scene, pick a player, then ask her to give you three pieces of information:<br/><br/>1) Which of the Themes is the scene about?<br/>2) Which Authority Figure or Friendship Question will the scene feature? "Featuring" means that it will appear in the scene, the scene will be informed by it, or the scene will be thematically linked to it.<br/>3) Say, "Tell me what the Authority or the YOs are doing as the scene opens. Just the first five seconds." If she starts to go beyond that first five seconds, cut her off and remind her it's just the first few moments. Ask follow-up questions if necessary to flesh out the scene more (e.g., if the YOs are there, where are they; who else is there; where did they leave the tank they got in the last scene?).<br/><br/>Play the scene out through to the conflict and aftermath and make sure that your setup or narration include the named elements. When the scene is over, explain to the table the purpose of the First Plot Point scene. Move to the next player clockwise from her and ask him the same questions.<br/><br/>Continue through until the episode ends, asking the next person clockwise each time. Include yourself: you get to frame one of these, too. I usually prefer to plan ahead so I get to frame the Midpoint scene, which is where the YOs should be at their absolute lowest point.<br/><br/>I also recommend varying who you ask to do what in each session. So in the next session you might ask the guy who did the First Plot Point this time to do the Exposition scene next time.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>This rule is here because GMing this game used to suck for me. I hated being constantly responsible for the creativity; hated constantly having to say what's next. This takes that weight off the Authority, but doesn't take his ability to frame scenes away. <br/><br/>This rule is here because, in introducing the presence of AFs, themes, and FQs, those things become more important.<br/><br/>This rule is here because YO players who introduce these elements are then bought into making sure they're present in the scene. <a href="http://www.museoffire.com/" rel="nofollow">Tony Lower-Basch</a> was great at constantly, subtly, and scrupulously reincorporating the elements that he introduced.<br/><br/>This rule is here because I didn't enjoy running my own game as much as I did <a href="http://www.dog-eared-designs.com/games.html" rel="nofollow">Primetime Adventures</a>, and I decided I'd figure out how to rip it off creatively.<br/><br/>This rule is here because everyone learns the three-act structure this way, and feels equally responsible for it. <br/><br/>This rule is here because asking people for these elements puts a stronger and clearer break between scenes. A formalizing element that says "That last scene is over, we're on a new one now" is very helpful to making scenes discreet things.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Use this rule from now on. The planning phase sucks, this is the new hotness, and it will make your world a better place. Lemme know how it goes if you use it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194154/#Comment_194154" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-25T12:23:59+00:00" title="February 25, 2009 12:23PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So there was a small error in my <a href="http://indie-insurgent.livejournal.com/41982.html" rel="nofollow">aforementioned</a> new downloadable content, the <a href="http://misspentyouthgame.com/scenemap.pdf" rel="nofollow">scene map</a>. The Midpoint scene (scene 5) was lacking space to note the plot point the scene generated. If you have an old version of it, you should replacinate it.<br/><br/>Of course, my <a href="http://indie-insurgent.livejournal.com/42817.html" rel="nofollow">post from earlier today</a> about the new scene framing rule renders this map non-ideal. I need to do some serious re-layout-ing to make it work with the new rule, and that's probably a bit lower on the burner.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
