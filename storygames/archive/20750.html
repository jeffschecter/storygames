Not as much as I would like (due to lack of time, mostly. Life gets busy like that). Right now I don't have a (ir)regular group that could fit in another player, unfortunately.<br/><br/>If you're looking for more players in the area, you could do worse than pay a visit to <a href="http://subcultures.nl/" rel="nofollow">Subcultures</a>, one of the local game shops. The owner is very into indie games, and it's an awesome shop to visit and look around (not just at the games, the shop itself looks very cool as well). They also organize game nights and the like regularly. See their website or Facebook.<br/><br/>Another way to find people to play with is through the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/netherlands-roleplaying-guild/" rel="nofollow">Netherlands Roleplaying Guild</a> meetup group. There's regular meetings organized (in Amsterdam and sometimes in Utrecht), most of it is in English, and they're a friendly bunch to keep in contact with (and find fellow players).<br/><br/>Hope that helps a bit. If I run into anything else worth mentioning, I'll add it to this thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
