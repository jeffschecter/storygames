It was a pretty slender piece of supplemental material (as was pretty much the whole game), but it was enough to get our unit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selous_Scouts" rel="nofollow">Selous Scouts</a> operating in the bush.<br/><br/>I don't own that book anymore, unfortunately.  It got misplaced somewhere in the intervening years and vanished.  Getting my hands on a new(ish) copy is proving to be a pretty difficult task.  But in the meanwhile I started kicking around the idea of reviving that game and going back to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodesian_Bush_War" rel="nofollow">Rhodesian Bush War</a> of 1964-1979.<br/><br/>The first thing I considered was doing a straight Selous Scouts campaign like the one I'd done before.  It's a counterinsurgency operation, provides a lot of command flexibility and, because the unit was multiracial, allows for some interesting stories about colonialism vs. nativism.  That last is something totally new, because I can tell you right now that Teenaged Me had precisely zero investment in exploring that kind of thing in a game.<br/><br/>Anyway, even though the Selous Scouts have a pretty straightforward mandate, things can get a little confusing when the players don't have at least a halfway decent handle on the politics of the war.  So I thought maybe it'd be better to switch gears and do something a little more traditional with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodesian_Special_Air_Service" rel="nofollow">Rhodesian SAS</a>.  The missions become strictly military then and a lot of the subtleties drop out.<br/><br/>But I kind of <i>like</i> the idea of retaining those subtleties.  I mean, I'm not fourteen anymore and maybe I ought to expect more from my games.<br/><br/>This however, opens me up to the big question of how much the players need to know before getting into things.  Is pointing them at some Wikipedia-level information enough?  Do I need to put together a document explaining the situation in detail before we can move forward?  What?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254485/#Comment_254485" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T10:31:22+00:00" title="February  2, 2010 10:31AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 2, 2010 10:34AM by Eric.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, the first thing I thought of, just after reading the words "Selous Scout" and before reading the wikipedia article, was...<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.sailor-games.com/images/senshiquiz4.jpg"/><br/><br/>After glancing through the wikipedia article, I have a, shall we say, substantially different reaction.

The beauty of a grunt-level campaign is that most of the characters may not really know much about the history, and so you can justify the players not knowing a whole lot, especially about the "traditional," geopolitics-y history of the conflict.  I would concur with Jason that you should aim for about a page worth, and assume they won't read much more - but give them some pointers in case they *want* to read more.  In my experience, for instance... the last game I played in with a "player's guide" was a D&amp;D game with a 12 page or so handout.  I and one other person at the table were the only ones who seem to have actually digested most of it.  And that was pretty short and non-technical.<br/><br/>I would just add that you might want to focus on more  "human" aspects of the setting, if you can.  E.g., if I was interested in playing someone who fought with the Rhodesians, I'd probably get a lot more out of reading Ken Flower's _Serving Secretly_ or (uh, can't remember the author)'s _Don't Lets Go to the Dogs Tonight_ than something like a history of the counterinsurgency campaign.  You want people to get details like that many people who fought against the rebels thought the government was being very generous in its land grants and thought of themselves as true Africans, not colonists (even if they were in part living in a bubble) - not get bogged down in details about supply lines, foreign support, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254527/#Comment_254527" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T12:55:51+00:00" title="February  2, 2010 12:55PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My first instinct in this kind of situation is to tie it into some kind of easily-accessible media; if there's a movie (documentary or otherwise) that hits the high points of the historical (or historical-ish) setting, that's <i>perfect</i>, because movies are dead easy to sell to people.  Everyone just has to sit down for two hours, and they all get the same presentation.<br/><br/>But sometimes that's not possible, in which case I go with Jason Morningstar's "a page of information, maybe two."  And I tell everyone very clearly that what is on that short handout are the only things that they really and truly need to know, and that they can refer to it during the game.  If something important that wasn't on the handout comes up, they're not responsible for that, and I won't ding them for not knowing it.  They can ask questions whenever they like, and I'll be happy to answer them.<br/><br/>Actually, I try to do both of these things whenever possible.  If I had to do just one, I'd probably go with the short handout since it gives everyone a reference they can use during play.<br/><br/><br/>I do tend to aim more for historical-ish in a setting, though, so accuracy is never a priority.  If I really, really wanted to <i>get it right</i>, I would just hand-pick the group to only be other people who already know or are interested in that particular historical period, so that everyone else would be as psyched about <i>getting it right</i> as I am.  But generally, I'd rather just play with my friends, and I don't assign homework to friends, so whatever historical settings we use are going to be handwaved to whatever extent is necessary for all of us to feel comfortable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254682/#Comment_254682" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T03:59:42+00:00" title="February  3, 2010  3:59AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 3, 2010 6:11AM by Sam!.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think most of us are on the same page in terms of what I ought to do: one or two pages as part of a campaign document.  As it happens, that's exactly what I do for something fictional if the setting requires more than a sentence or two to explicate.  I don't have to say much beyond "<i>Star Wars</i>," for example, to get a game like that going, but need more for something like <i>Dune</i>.<br/><br/>Historical-ish is definitely what I'd be shooting for here.  Maybe fold in some major events and real people from time to time, but for the most part allowing things to play out in our own pocket version of the Rhodesian conflict.  As when <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11277" rel="nofollow">playing with fictional canon</a>, too much adherence to reality can actually (I think) interfere with the players' fun because it's as though they aren't in control of the situation the way they might expect to be, being the main characters and all.

I was dealing with similar issues trying to write <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/projects/mwaantaangaand/" rel="nofollow">a game about the Angolan Civil War</a>, coincidentally enough, because it's something that most folks just have no clue about. I don't think I did a very good job of making it functional or transmitting the information.<br/><br/>Honestly, I think the games that have been most successful at transmitting background are the fixed character games like Montsegur 1244 and Lady Blackbird, because it allows the scenario designer to write the setting into the PCs as well as the NPCs and situations.  But that may be a different type of thing than you're prepared to do here.  But there are other things you can do, frex: Grey Ranks.

It is well known you can only have the real kind of fun when you are learning or otherwise making yourself better in some way. So the learning part should be the playing part in itself, rather than (boring) pre-play homework.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, make the players learn about the Rhodesian Bush War by being there in the key moments and meeting some of the key people, those are the kind of lessons that you never forget. Make them care by making their mission and their survival dependent on their understanding of how things work, what factions are there, what is going on, and so on. Are this villagers coming to share their water with the PCs or to lynch them? That will make them care and soon they will be trying to find clues and asking questions to your NPCs to better figure out everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can tell you did a good job if after the first session the players start looking for information on their own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
