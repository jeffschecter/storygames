If you want to see the HQ conversion, feel free to whisper the request and I'll look at making another thread for that discussion.<br/><br/>Here is part of it.  This is one of the generic ones for a Solar, Lunar, or Sidereal focused campaign. I have some others which are not ready for Dragonbloods and Abyssals, and then some for "cross over" campaigns with all walks of life. When I run it, it will probably be Solar and/or Lunar focused, so I'm not focusing on the other types just now.<br/><br/>I'm looking for any feedback. Is it broad enough? Could the questions be better? Anything scream out "the suck"? Do you just think it's perfect and awesome?<br/><br/>------------------------------\n<h1>Celestial Circle Burner</h1>\n<p><b>The Exalted</b><br/></p><p>Is the story about Solars, Lunars, or Sidreals? Young Solars often try to make a name for themselves, or right wrongs (either for personal revenge or a broader positive change). Lunars often try to gain power for their fringe society, either the tribe they belong to or a social experiment with a new group, or they try to improve human society as a whole, by whatever means that requires. Sidereals work for Celestial Beaucracies keeping Creation moving, or further their agendas of Fate by trying to direct the flow of events. What is the goal for your circle? What brought them together, their unique natures, or was it orchestrated by another Exalted or a god?<br/></p><p>Each character should have at least one relationship (to their God, a friend, a family member, or an Exalted mentor) and a personality trait to reflect how they feel about their Exalted nature.<br/></p><p><b>Location</b><br/></p><p>Is the story about the Exalted making local change, either a struggle against an existing society, or forging an entirely new one?<br/></p><p>If so, pick a location on the map and flesh it out. General area features, any natural resources, the ways of the dead in a nearby Shadowland, etiquette of a spirit court, the local traders and markets, connections to other states and organizations, raising horses or something else of local color. Each player should pick at least one ability that reflects some specific knowledge about the area, including general area knowledge. What important figures are in the area? Is there a local ruler, a Realm military outpost, a gang of bandits, a little god, an unbound Demon? Each player should pick a relationship connecting them to a figure.<br/></p><p>If not, then the story is about traveling around the world. Why does your Circle travel endlessly? Are they on a quest? Do they need allies? Are they looking for several treasures to assemble? Is someone hunting them? Each player should pick at least one ability to describe knowledge about some part of the world, and a relationship to describe a connection to some figure. Both of these are the same as above, except that each character's ability and relationship must be for a unique area (although the abilities and relationships don't have to be from the same area, two characters shouldn't know people in the South).<br/></p><p><b>Allies</b><br/></p><p>What mortals can they trust for support, and who look to them for protection? What little gods support them? Are there any other Exalted willing to help them? What about ghosts, monsters, Fair Folk, or demons? Why do they want to help you? Simple friendship, do they owe you a favor, perhaps they secretly want to use you for their goals?<br/></p><p>Each player should take a relationship to reflect one of their allies.<br/></p><p><b>Enemies</b><br/></p><p>What Exalted oppose them? Are there Solars working with opposing goals? Are they a known enemy of a Dragonblood? Do they threaten a Sidereal's plan? Is their a Lunar Circle galvanizing barbarians against them? What gods have they made enemies of? Is there a Deathlord plotting against them? What mortals are working against them? Is there a Demon opposing them? What have these enemies done to you? Murdered a loved one? Hunted you like an animal? Betrayed you? Stole something? Tried to force you into service? And how have you treated them in return? Have you spilt blood without remorse? Have you caused them to suffer? Do you seek peace and reconciliation?<br/></p><p>Each player should take a relationship to reflect one of these.<br/></p><p><b>Resources</b><br/></p><p>Do the exalted have artifacts in their possession? Do they have access to great treasure? Do they possess a Manse? Do they have followers, a powerful sidekick, or a familiar?<br/></p><p>Take an ability to reflect this.<br/></p><p><b>Needs</b><br/></p><p>What do the Exalted need? Do they need followers or an army? Are they looking for artifacts to call their own? Do they need a Demense, or if they have a Demense, do they need the tools to build a Manse? Do they need land to claim as their own?<br/></p><p>Be sure no one has an ability to reflect what they need.<br/></p><p><b>The Time of Tumult</b><br/></p><p>The Emperess has vanished, leaving the Realm on the brink of civil war. Deathlords are expanding their empires of the dead. Solars have returned, and pursue their own agendas. Sidereals are trying to keep their orchestrations of fate undercontrol. Lunars are ready to topple civilization. The Spirit Courts are in disarray. Demons lurk in hidden corners. Fair Folk eat away at the edge of reality. Creation is on the brink of major change. How are you mixed up in it all?<br/></p><p>As a part of all this, someone has just made an enemy of your circle. What did they do? Why are you unable to ignore it? What do you plan to do about it?<br/></p><p>Take at least a personality trait to reflect how your character wants to react.<br/></p><p><b>Characters</b><br/></p><p>Decide what each character is. They should be unique and varied in their abilities. Outside of that, do they come from a common background or from far corners of Creation? How did the characters meet? Are they a Circle now, a joining enforced by Heaven?  Or are they a more casual group? What is the overall purpose of working together? Is it to reestablish a Solar ruled Realm? Overthrow the gods? Forge a nation in their own corner of the world? Eradicate the shadowlands? Forge a peace with the Fair Folk? <br/></p><p>Each player should take a Motivation in line with the overall goal.<br/></p><p>If they are a circle, take a relationship with the Circle as a whole and name it. If not, each character must take at least one relationship with another character - this can be direct or indirect (such as a common mentor or organization).</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115192/#Comment_115192" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-18T19:20:19+00:00" title="December 18, 2007  7:20PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since I'm starting the test run of the game tomorrow, a soul panicked urgent bump.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
