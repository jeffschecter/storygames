I think it went pretty well.</p>\n<p>In the first session, which was several weeks ago, three of us got together to play.  I GMed.  Andy made a Faceman/Decker called Jun.  Shane made a Rigger/Sammy called Raid.  Characters took probably a little over an hour to create, which left us plenty of time to get into the story &amp; the mission.</p>\n<p>The characters were sub-contracted through Jun's Yakuza boss to investigate the happenings on a five-block area called the Cossic Strip.  You see, the Cossic Strip is a plot of land surrounded by two canals and consisting entirely of ork and troll squatters.  Apparently the citizens of the Cossic Strip have begun dissapearing en masse, and the folks at nearby Ares Macrotech are concerned about loosing a sizeable and inexpensive labor force.  So, Ares sent a man to hire Jun &amp; Raid to find out where the ork &amp; trolls are going to, and to try to convince them to stay on the Strip.</p>\n<p>By the end of the first session Jun &amp; Raid had discovered that there's a human bike gang moving into the Cossic Strip.  The orks &amp; trolls that live there don't seem to know exactly what's going on, but the general consensus is that the gang is killing their kind and dumping them into the canals.  Having heard that the gang's bikes were all brand new, the two PCs decided to check out a nearby bike shop to see who was making the purchases.  We ended that first session just as Raid decided it would be a good idea to hack into the shop's security cameras and get a visual ID on the dude who was single-handedly buying dozens of new bikes at a time.</p>\n<p>Last night's session in my next post...</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119392/#Comment_119392" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-14T06:41:43+00:00" title="January 14, 2008  6:41AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>This session, we were joined by two new players: Mark and Alan.  Character generation took probably about the same amount of time.  We gathered at Andy's place at about 11 and both Mark and Alan had complete characters at about 12:30.  So, that was an hour and a half, but it included the usual chatter and discussion that comes naturally when folks get together to game.</p>\n<p>Mark created a bird-looking mutant woman by the name of Gulio.  She's a little bit shaman and a little bit sniper.  Alan created a dwarf called Hauche, who was raised by his native family deep in the mountains of South America.  He's a little bit drug-dealer and a lotta-bit shaman.</p>\n<p>We started off the session by testing out the hacked version of the deckign rules.  Turns out that they're a-ok. In just a few minute's time we were able to play through an entire decking mini-mission.  All of the players seemed interested in the actions of the decker and no one had the urge to go out for pizza.</p>\n<p>Andy proposed an elegant ret-con where his character, Jun, had already called up Gulio and Hauche and planed a meeting in The Republic of the Congo (which is a five-story open air market and indipendant city-state).  There Gulio had the idea to see if they couldn't sell their actions to an additional buyer.  After all, Ares must not be the only one interested in keeping the Cossic Strip full of orks and trolls, right?  With a little bit of research, and aided by a sprit of the sun, Gulio tracked down the owner of a small fishery that sold food to the Strip.  Food that only Trolls enjoy.  With Hauche's help, the two managed to talk the owner into paying them to do the thing they're already doing.  The additional payday wasn't as large as the original offer, but it was close.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Jun had discovered that the guy who was buying up all the motorcycles is the CEO of a small paint corporation.  All the players took about a nano-second to decide that the paint company was a front for something else.  So, while Gulio and Hauche were talking to the fishery owner, Jun and Raid went to visit the offices of the paint company.</p>\n<p>This is where Andy blew my mind.</p>\n<p>After the usual banter with the secretary at the paint offices (Would you like to make an appointment?  Mr. Thompson is available in the middle of next month...) Jun just pulled out a file with the "incriminating" pictures of Thompson buying up the bikes and told the secretary that they'd like to talk to her boss about his involvement in the slaughter of hundreds of poor orks and trolls.  The secretary got flabbergasted and called up Thompson.  "Mr Thompson would like to meet with you tomorrow morning."  To which Jun replied "See, we've got this video we're about to release to the public..."  "Mr. Thomposon suggests a meeting in two hours at a nearby pub."</p>\n<p>The PCs had just blackmailed the CEO into talking with them.  Awesome.  Better yet, the CEO was going to make it a trap.  And the players/PCs knew that.  It wasn't discussed, just casually observed by everyone at the table.</p>\n<p>more in a minute....</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119396/#Comment_119396" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-14T06:56:55+00:00" title="January 14, 2008  6:56AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>In preparation for the meeting, Gulio went to the building across the street from the Pub and set up with her sniper rifle.  She was equipped with vision enhansers that would allow her to see through the walls and into the pub with about 95% visibility and loaded ammunition that would ignore all the barriers between them.</p>\n<p>The next scene got a little convoluted.</p>\n<p>Hauche decided to go to the Trolls who did the security work on the Strip and talk to them about what was going on.  When he get's to their lair, he finds them getting ready to go to war with the gang.  About the same time, Raid and Jun spot a couple vans lining up outside the Strip.  Vans that they later discover are there to record the fight between the Trolls and the Human gang.  The PCs/players theorize that the idea is to use news of trolls slaughtering humans as a way to further fuck with the citizens of the strip.</p>\n<p>After some careful negotiations, Hauche talks most of the trolls into not fighting tonight.  But there are six who are so bloodthirsty that they cannot be talked down.  So, instead, Hauche enlists them to help cover the iminent meeting with Thompson.  After all, the PCs are pretty sure it's going to be a bloody set-up.  But, what makes them nervous is what they'll do with six angry and well-armed trolls if there isn't any gunplay.</p>\n<p>When we get to the meeting, we have Hauche sitting outside the back door of the Pub with a half-dozen cigar smoking trolls, which he conceals using a spirit of the moon.  We also have Guilo set up next door with her sniper rifle, ready to take out anyone who fucks with the team.  And we have Raid and Jun who walk right in for the talks.</p>\n<p>Thompson came to the meet with a huge cyborg woman at his side, who's carrying a wide-spectrum jamming device, and four mook-style guards.  Guards who have uzis hidden in briefcases.  Thompson offers the team cash for dropping the mission.  When Raid and Jun refuse on the ground that their boss wouldn't put up with that, Thompson orders his men to fire.</p>\n<p>In a few moment's time, Raid has blown up the jamming device, the cyborg has impaled Jun on her cyber-claws, the Trolls have gunned down all the uzi-mooks, Hauche has put Thompson to sleep, and Gulio has blown the head clean off the cyborg with a single shot.</p>\n<p>And that effectively was the end of our evening.  We ended by playing around with the hacked first-aid rolls.  I expect to open the next session with a discussion about what they're going to do with Thompson.  I know the players wanted to kidnapp and interrogate him, but I'm not sure about what kind of logistics they may have had in mind.</p>\n<p>In any event, the session was excellent.  I can't wait to play again.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119434/#Comment_119434" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-14T10:58:35+00:00" title="January 14, 2008 10:58AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, that sounds great.

Which rocks.  But I've gotta tell you, the reason why we're getting those results isn't entirely due to the differences between the hack and 2nd edition.  Much of it is due to the fact that the hack impliments a part of the 2nd edition rules that our group largely ignored back in the day.</p>\n<p>If you happen to have a copy of SR2 hanging about, check out page 187.  Unfortunately, I've just realized that this is one of the things that I neglected to actually include in my Sombra Console document, but I can summarize it for you if you don't have a copy of SR sitting around the office.</p>\n<p>What pg 187 of the SR2 rules covers is NPC "Threat Ratings".  The rules are, as is usual in SR, a bit convoluted, but what they boil down to is a morale system.  An 'average' NPC will quit fighting after taking a light wound.  A 'semi-trained' NPC will quit fighting after taking a moderate wound.  A 'trained' NPC quits after a serious wound and a 'professional' NPC doesn't quit 'till their dead.</p>\n<p>In that final combat the other night, I decided that every NPC except the cyborg chic would fight 'till moderately wounded, while the cyborg would fight to the death.  So, in our game last night, a moderate wound was often decisive.</p>\n<p>So yeah, it's completely awesome.  But I can't take credit for writing it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119468/#Comment_119468" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-14T12:38:33+00:00" title="January 14, 2008 12:38PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eric: Guailo/Lucinda wants a spell to see through walls so that the next time an electronic shield goes up, she won't be biting her lip in angst.<br/><br/>Or, I'd also love it if I could make a spirit fight the spirit of the machine.

But it probably doesn't have the range you want.  I'd be open to the possiblity of writing up a longer range version.  But it'll have to have a pretty rough drain code.

They help you do constructive things.</p>\n<p>I know it didn't come up last night, but check this out:</p>\n<p>Because your scope vs. the jammer was an electronic measure vs. counter-measure situation, it would have been possible for you to take an action to try to get around the jamming.  The roll would have been Guailo's INT vs. the cyborg's INT (because she was operating the jammer).  Because this is totally an INT-based 'search' thing, I certainly would have given you the thumbs-up to get an appropriate nature spirit to help you out with fine-tuning your scope.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119501/#Comment_119501" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-14T14:28:32+00:00" title="January 14, 2008  2:28PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In future games, I'd love to see more roleplaying of how the "conversation" or "communication" with the spirits goes down.

That's what I'd love to see outisde help with.  Like, "What does it really mean to talk to the Sun? What's it like? What is communing with a totem like? An elemental?" That sort of thing.<br/><br/>As you can tell, I can visualize and re-lay my own goofy computer skills when I do the hacking, basically embellishing a lot of side details on to "what it means/what it's like" to hack a CPU, or to mess with a storage node, or to divert black Ice (and being able to throw out a sentence or two of improv about the attempt here and there).  But when it comes to spirti stuff, I'm like "Hmmmmmm, sorry I ain't got nothing." And I'd love to have some input to help change that, so I can do with spirit stuff what I can do with hacking or kung fu or negotiation, etc.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119621/#Comment_119621" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-15T07:23:22+00:00" title="January 15, 2008  7:23AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Oh, ok.  I think I see what you're looking for.  I think.</p>\n<p>I'm feeling pretty wide open to all sorts of possiblities.  When Guailo asks the sun spirits for help in finding things, how might that manifest?  Maybe the sun reflects off of the thing that she's looking for.  Like how important things tend to be extra-shiny in Resident Evil.  Or maybe a little shimmering spirit-creature-thing sits on her shoulder and whispers ideas on where to look.  That's goovy too.</p>\n<p>If I were to come up with a single guideline for how to narrate these things, I guess it would look like this:</p>\n<p>What does it look like when that natural thing (the sun, the river, the street, the forest, etc) helps you do the thing that you're trying to do (hide, search, repair, etc)?
