First, it is assumed that your characters may encounter things way out of their league, things that the only sensible response to is an energetic retreat. This reminded me very strongly of Call of Cthulhu in a good way. It made me realize that the carefully tuned "you level, monsters get tougher" approach of pretty much every version of D&amp;D means that the challenge is effectively identical across the lives of your characters.   <br/><br/>Second, and related, monsters are supposed to be singular and mythic. Not a dragon, but <i>the </i>dragon. You don't know how to fight a purple worm because you've fought purple worms before - you only have legend and hearsay to rely on. This ramps up the tension and fear appreciably.<br/><br/>The LotFP encumbrance system is transcendent. Simple, functional, easy to use and effective.<br/><br/>The adventures Raggi's included have call-out boxes explaining his rationale for including specific elements, as well as his thoughts on how things might go in certain areas, warnings about how to handle stuff, etc. This is such a good idea and I've personally never seen it implemented this way. It's like a designer commentary peppered with genuinely useful information.<br/><br/>The game is full of nice little touches - equipment, for example, has different prices in urban and rural areas. Rations are expensive in the city, cheap on the farm. Swords are opposite.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288232/#Comment_288232" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-23T06:45:38+00:00" title="August 23, 2010  6:45AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with your points, they are very good. Raggi's game is the first D&amp;D-heritage edition I've seen that shares my own preferences in regards to character "builds", challenge "balancing", routine adventurer kitsch and all that other rot you get with the dominant paradigm. I never was a "D&amp;D player" myself, but the more I learn about the possibilities, the more strongly I think that being willing to have your character be affected by the milieu to the point of horrible death is key to satisfactory fantasy adventure gaming the way I like it. I can play Raggi's game without getting jarred by the bland engineer-like utility of running around with a boatload of magic items and having characters visit magician guilds for their everyday fantastical needs, which is a pretty good thing to my eye.<br/><br/>I follow Raggi's approach and deeds with interest, as it seems to me that he's likely to continue evolving towards some direction in his writing about this singular tradition of roleplaying that he's attached to. I'm sort of waiting for him to decide that bland pluses on magic items are for wimps, for instance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288247/#Comment_288247" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-23T07:31:40+00:00" title="August 23, 2010  7:31AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2010 7:31AM by Clinton.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite><br/>I follow Raggi's approach and deeds with interest, as it seems to me that he's likely to continue evolving towards some direction in his writing about this singular tradition of roleplaying that he's attached to.

Each monster you encounter will be unique and each magic item has its own story and is one-of-a-kind.<br/><br/>I am really not used to the concept of making parts of adventures challenges to the players' inquisitiveness and ingenuity, and it can be frustrating when it's all about traps where the players have to be overly careful and try to read the GMs mind. I saw it pay off so well, though, when the players came up with a real, likely-to-work plan to destroy a high-level wizard, and then pulled it off. If they'd made a mistake or had a poor plan, they probably would have all died, but their plan was brilliant and worked.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288250/#Comment_288250" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-23T07:46:06+00:00" title="August 23, 2010  7:46AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2010 8:48AM by Mark_Causey.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was having a great time (and, in the end, had a fun time) roleplaying my 15 year old female magic user. She ordered her protector around and chastised him a moment later. I watched as two clerics I didn't care about argue theology and I paid attention to the handsome torch bearer. I got really scared at times and embarassed at others. I rallied my courage to fight a horrific monster. Then, things changed.<br/><br/>There is a point made in the Bite Sized AP regarding the following scene (paraphrased): When the cleric stands in front of a magic mirror and is slain by his emergent doppleganger, the party accepts the healthy cleric into the party.<br/><br/>We had previously only encountered one monster and indecision nearly killed us. I realized that my character would rally against such obvious bad intent/monstrous actions and ran forward to stab him with her spear. Restrained by my protector, I watched as everyone accepted him into the party. The specialist (thief) asked everyone if they had a problem with this. I felt I'd made my thoughts clear and no one agreed with me.<br/><br/>So, on a meta level, my thoughts are: make a big fight in the party and run the adventure to a halt or accept the D&amp;D paradigm of needing a complete party and we're just here to kill things and get the treasure and move on.<br/><br/>I should have said more, but I didn't. My fault. I kind of tuned out at that point. This is in no way a complaint against Clinton's running of the game. It's just my statement of "Oh, yeah, I got invested in one way in which the game doesn't fully support."<br/><br/>EDIT: I should have trusted the group more, in retrospect. I'm conflating "doesn't support well" with "it wouldn't work at all". Still, I'm not sure inter-party conflict would have felt right even if roleplayed to the hilt. We *could* have given Ara a new character (the torchbearer), but I'm thinking a sour taste would have been left after that. Still, something to grow on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288460/#Comment_288460" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T08:36:34+00:00" title="August 24, 2010  8:36AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JimLotFP comments on this thread <a href="http://lotfp.blogspot.com/2010/08/more-boring-updates.html" rel="nofollow">on his blog</a> (about halfway through).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288475/#Comment_288475" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T09:37:18+00:00" title="August 24, 2010  9:37AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How are the first six levels of this game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288477/#Comment_288477" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T09:48:39+00:00" title="August 24, 2010  9:48AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            FWIW, I agree with him.

For instance, I don't find it mechanically feasible for RAW characters and encounters to scale beyond the reach of first-level characters at higher levels due to the lack of an attack progression and permanent, reliable magic. You mostly just get more difficult to kill with levels. Meanwhile a much more important form of progress comes in the way you collect and expend wealth; it's more important because gaining wealth allows your character to move from essentially taking whatever adventure the GM throws at you into a position of influence, of choosing his exploits. Experience is secondary next to this, and provides no fundamental shifts into the nature of the game.</li><li>Despite everything said above, this is still a D&amp;D variant, and I would expect any campaign to get a sort of "static" from outside the immediate game text and its implications. The adventures used and attitudes brought into the game will make the game sway more towards a D&amp;D-like baseline in actual play, I would think. For instance, nothing in the game particularly prevents massive weaponization of magic.</li></ul>\nRegardless of how the game is played, the fact remains that the overwhelmingly most important thing gained by characters over levels is hit points and saves. In fact, these are the only things that dwarves (hit point monsters) and halflings (save monsters) get. Everybody else gets a bit better in their own specialties (attack bonus for fighters, spells for clerics and wizards, skills for specialists), but I would say that the characters never really overcome their basic nature: traps still kill, monsters still kill, death magic still kills no matter what level your character is. The benefits of gaining levels are mostly passive in nature, improving survivability, so any real increased impact that the characters might come to have will for the most part come from their adventures, following from the fiction instead of the rules: improved station, found magics, a new pet gorilla, whatever, it all comes from the events and not from straight xp gain. I am, of course, immensely pleased: I like it much more when low-level characters are not invalidated as factors in the game world by making high-level characters outright superheroes by piling up leet powerz they get just by the virtue of accumulating xp. Much cooler if your increased impact comes from the events in the fiction, making character level only one factor of many in determining what your character can do.<br/><br/>(What I said in that other thread of course still holds: while I like the game, I could have imagined some more explicit writing for it. The above, for instance, is just me reading between the lines and working out the implications of the rules; it would have been better if something like this were written in the book, assuming something of the sort was intended. I can totally imagine how Raggi was somewhat held back by scheduling and the fact that he and his entire subculture is still very much working out their whole thing. Work in progress, this game.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288515/#Comment_288515" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T12:18:31+00:00" title="August 24, 2010 12:18PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm trying to get an impression of the 'sweet spot' for this game - even if all you can give is an opinion that comes from perusing the text.  <br/><br/>I'm always on the lookout for hackable OGL games that are built for campaigns and which perform well early on.
