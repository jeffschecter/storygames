I have two approaches for you:<br/><br/><br/><b>Approach <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a></b><br/><br/>First of all, let the player base collectively play the "core community", whatever that is for the campaign. This means letting them make whatever strategic decisions there might be to make (color elements at least, if nothing else) in between sessions. It doesn't matter who does this, whether they even ever participate in the actual play, as long as the process is open to interested people to participate in.<br/><br/>Then, identify that core community. For example, it could be a mercenary company in a war-torn world. So the mercenary company is going about doing its business week to week, and occasionally adventures happen; the entire company doesn't go on these adventures, because it's not an adventuring company, but they are there fore background resources and to bail out adventurers maybe, depending on the situation. The individual characters are members of the company, each with their own rank and responsibilities, on top of which they decide to occasionally go adventuring. Each session starts from wherever the company is currently situated, at camp, so you can move the community around handily in between adventures.<br/><br/>Instead of a mercenary company you could have a big trading ship, or a traveling circus, or simply a growing town in the borderlands (in which case the campaign would obviously focus on the immediate environs - not a problem for D&amp;D if the town just happens to be situated in the Dungeon Valley). Anything that consists of many enough people that you don't actually need to enumerate them precisely, and that has a place for the PCs to go when they're not in play. You could even let your player base design the community, give it some stats and whatever. The campaign as a whole could have a community arc where the fate of the community is influenced by the adventures.<br/><br/>Finally, you need a way to handle sessions that end in the middle of a dungeon. It might be the case that your ready-made adventures can't handle this, but what I myself do (my face-to-face D&amp;D campaigns always have a somewhat rotating player base) is, I mandate that the party always has to retreat from the dungeon at the end of a session. The only exception is the "quick save", in which case the players are responsible for coordinating a sequel session within 7 days to continue where we left off. Unless this is managed, the next session always begins at the base camp (with the GM deciding how the party ended up there, if they ended the last adventure in a precarious situation). This is outright the simplest way to go about it, I think, as it saves you from having to write too many session notes, too.<br/><br/><br/><b>Approach <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a></b><br/><br/>Somewhat like your virtual reality idea (except cooler for an old fart) is my D&amp;D campaign set in Lovecraft's Dreamlands (or my own twisted take on them, anyway): the player characters are dreamers who return to the Dreamlands on occasion and have adventures there. Remembering about your waking life in the Dreamlands is a privilege and not a right, so you can play with that aspect as much as you will; it is entirely possible that the dreamers are in fact from different places and times, even different worlds, depending on how you want to run the cosmology. Characters popping in and out at will is a natural feature of the concept.<br/><br/>If you go with this sort of high-concept conceit, I recommend having some conceit-specific campaign content, too. For example, wizards who can help a character remember who they are, things in the dreamlands that remind them of their waking life, dream monsters trying to escape into the real world and so on. It'd be cool if individual characters got dream quests on occasion, meaning mysterious compulsion to act for subconscious reasons; following such a quest successfully results in a quest xp reward, and the quest is no doubt somehow related to the waking life of such a PC.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458581/#Comment_458581" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-06T15:42:12+00:00" title="December  6, 2016  3:42PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 6, 2016 3:42PM by Adam_Dray.">edited December 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An evil trickster deity teleports adventurers in and out of a purgatorial dungeon to amuse himself.<br/><br/>See: <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2056633109/the-grande-temple-of-jing-pathfinder-fantasy-rpgs" rel="nofollow">The Grande Temple of Jing</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458585/#Comment_458585" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-06T17:09:08+00:00" title="December  6, 2016  5:09PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero's "dreamland" concept is quite powerful.<br/><br/>Another way to approach it would be to call it an intentional kind of dreaming, like a "spirit quest". Certain people can engage in a ritual to "send themselves" into this other world, perhaps with the goal of retrieving certain items or information, or meeting certain other entities.<br/><br/>When you send your soul into this other world, you take on the form of a "spirit animal", except that, in this setting, the "spirit animal" is, instead, a powerful warrior-spirit (the D&amp;D character). <br/><br/>You do not control, however, when and where you enter the dreamworld, nor when and where you wake up from the dream. That gives you (the DM) latitude to drop players into "in media res" situations, skip the prologue of many adventures, and swap them out willy-nilly. ("The next night, Fulfir the dreamer could no longer send forth his spirit, and another was chosen by the Elders. They await portents to determine when Fulfir can resume the quest, while he sits in the corner of the hut and anxiety gnaws at him.")<br/>\n<blockquote><br/>Finally, you need a way to handle sessions that end in the middle of a dungeon. It might be the case that your ready-made adventures can't handle this, but what I myself do (my face-to-face D&amp;D campaigns always have a somewhat rotating player base) is, I mandate that the party always has to retreat from the dungeon at the end of a session.</blockquote>\nOne nice approach I've seen to this is the "Escape from the Dungeon" roll or random table.<br/>If a session ends without the characters making their way to safety, you roll on this table to see what happens to them.<br/><br/>You can have a mix of outcomes, including some good ones (they make it back, score XPs, loot, etc) and some bad ones (they died in the dungeon, they made it back but without any of their equipment, they must choose what they abandoned on the way out, they all come back diseased or wounded, they make it out but are now lost in the wilderness, etc.).<br/><br/>This creates a strong incentive for players to wrap it up before a session ends.<br/><br/>(If you can't have characters dying or suffering setbacks, I suppose the "softest" version might be that they make it back but do not score any XPs at all.)<br/><br/>You can even create modifiers for this roll based on the characters' situation. This depends on what you want to emphasize in the game. For instance, the roll on the random table could have positive outcomes near the top, and positive modifiers for each of the following criteria:<br/><br/>* The PC is at full health (hit points).<br/>* The PC is together with all her companions.<br/>* The PC ended the session in a safe spot, free from danger. (Not in combat or near a trap.)<br/>* The PC knows their location and can describe a path back to an exit. (e.g. Has access to an accurate map.)<br/>* The PC has plenty of torches, water, and food.<br/><br/>Or whatever things you want to encourage.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JohnnFour" title="JohnnFour"><img alt="JohnnFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JohnnFour">JohnnFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458588/#Comment_458588" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-06T18:09:40+00:00" title="December  6, 2016  6:09PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the ideas, guys!<br/><br/>What about sharing plot hooks and other info?<br/><br/>I could ask this be done in a community area, but I wonder if there's a mechanical way to ensure story continuity and not leave things to chance?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458589/#Comment_458589" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-06T18:54:30+00:00" title="December  6, 2016  6:54PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hate to ask the obvious, but are you familiar with Ben Robbins' <a href="arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/78/grand-experiments-west-marches" rel="nofollow">West Marches</a>-style campaigns?<br/><br/>These are specifically designed to handle open table games.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JohnnFour" title="JohnnFour"><img alt="JohnnFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JohnnFour">JohnnFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458591/#Comment_458591" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-06T19:00:37+00:00" title="December  6, 2016  7:00PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Adam.

But what about having people submit their characters,  and their characters personalities and motives, a week or two weeks prior to when they will be in their session of play.  You would make it a point to always introduce the players that will be coming in the next session as in NPCs in the current session, and play them as close to the characters, which the PCs sent you with their description and character sheets, as you can.  When it came time for the players to have their session they would just pick up from where their characters left off when they Where NPCs. this isn't a perfect solution but it might be interesting and add some coherency to the whole thing.  It certainly would require some work and creativity on your part.

There's a home base -- a city that is considered "safe" for the PCs. Nothing interesting happens there, adventure-wise. But it's a base of operations, a place to meet other adventures, the spot where every adventure starts, and specifically the location of The Map, carved into a table there and shared among all the adventurers.<br/><br/>West Marches insists that each foray into the wilderness must be driven by the players. They come to the GM and say they want to explore the Barrier Peaks or the leftmost cave of the Caves of Chaos or whatever hooks you've offered them. They arrange the time and place to play with each other, and with you.

Whoever shows up is there, whoever doesn't isn't, no explanation is given or requested. I think someone on here once summed it up as "put in your quarter and press the button marked Player 2" -- just an explicit statement that in this particular case, the important thing is that you're there and you're ready to play, and the details of where your character was last week when you weren't there or where some other person's character is this week are never, ever going to be important.<br/><br/><br/>Sharing info from session to session is a bit harder to handle with a drop-in gaming situation. Putting things up online is good, but inevitably I think the ball gets dropped there one way or the other, either through lack of updates or (more commonly) because people don't read it before showing up.<br/><br/>So I think having something at each game session that's physically updated with new information, notes, and plans is a better place to start: maybe a big sheet of butcher paper that everyone can stick post-it notes onto to describe who various NPCs are and what plans have been made, maybe a big office calendar that players can mark up with what their characters did and various upcoming deadlines. Maybe a ledger for shared party resources, or a stack of index cards with shared resources written on them that can be passed around during a game session and then handed back when it's done. Maybe a big "To-Do" list that people can add things to and cross things off of. Whatever works for the game's structure, really.<br/><br/>And building a little routine around the start and end of a session to get everyone on the same page is also a good idea. "Last week on 'Adventurers of the Lost Patreon,' our heroes learned THIS, and were planning to do THAT. And so tonight begins at the entrance to the evil catacomb, with everyone gearing up to do what they do best," or whatever, just a quick minute or so to establish what was set up last time. And then end the session with five or fifteen minutes of people summing up important things they learned (and writing them down on whatever you're writing stuff down on), and sketching out a general notion of what they think needs to be done next.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458628/#Comment_458628" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-08T17:15:02+00:00" title="December  8, 2016  5:15PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Sharing info from session to session is a bit harder to handle with a drop-in gaming situation.

Certainly, some groups would forget or not bother, but that would have consequences for the other players, and they would learn to either live with the consequences or do better next time. If the players were appropriately inclined, some peer pressure would come into play, with players trying to make sure they got the "scoop" from previous adventurers.\n<blockquote><br/>All sessions end with the current scouting party pack at the main group.

Coming to the end of a session (with people needing to leave on short notice) and suddenly having to <i>negotiate</i> a random table with nothing less than everyone's characters' survival on the line... that sounds like a really uncomfortable situation.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste%27s">@AccountingForTaste's</a> suggestion of "not overthinking it" is also pretty good, I think. You can let people show up and play and have the larger structure of how the characters and sessions relate to each other develop organically; your groups will develop their own dynamics (such as whether they share information with each other or hoard it obsessively for selfish benefit). You might learn some new things in the process!<br/><br/>It depends on how much of the game you want to have "mapped out" from the start.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458632/#Comment_458632" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-09T06:47:11+00:00" title="December  9, 2016  6:47AM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Go with the Conan approach.
