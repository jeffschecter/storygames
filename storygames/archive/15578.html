The playset would implicitly be based around the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books and movies, with the serial numbers filed off.<br/><br/>So far the idea I've got cooking is that each card has a "Think about it!" section.  So, for instance, a card might look like this: <br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Relationship: Friends<br/><br/>Best Friends<br/><br/>Think About It! <br/>* How long have you been best friends?<br/>* What do you like to do that your friend doesn't? <br/>* How do your parents feel about your friendship? <br/>* Does one or the other of you try to get you to do<br/>  things together that you shouldn't?<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>... It's a start, which is why it's here in Little Ideas.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
