I'm having a blast design-blogging and having email discussions and failing to sleep at night with too many ideas bouncing around my brain.  All good!<br/><br/>But I find I'm hitting a lot of questions in my idea-feedback-revise loop where I don't feel I can get a handle on what's going on unless I see how people engage the idea or mechanic in play.  So the answer is "Playtest," right?  But I don't know the first thing about such an endeavor...<br/><br/>So I have a few questions!  Since this is probably an ancient topic, I hope people can point me to good resources as much as share their own strategies and experiences.<br/><br/>1) At what point in the design process do you start playtesting?  Do you wait to produce a document that feels solid and polished, or is it more experimental--"guys, I don't know how this is going to work really, but give it a spin and see how it feels"?<br/><br/>2) Do you playtest hands-on or hands-off?  E.g. if your game has a GM role, would you GM the playtest game?  Or do you find it better to set it loose into a group entirely separate from yourself?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103371/#Comment_103371" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-16T23:38:54+00:00" title="October 16, 2007 11:38PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One place to look is the latest episode of the Master Plan podcast (episode #17).

Some people like to design in detail, in private, then test a polished version; some people like to knock around half-formed ideas; some people see value in both. <br/><br/>2. There seems to be general agreement that, after you've playtested by yourself, you should get someone else to run your game. Then there's value both in remote playtests (you give them the document, tell them to get on with it and wait for their feedback) and observed playtests (you watch a group playtest your game).<br/><br/>For myself...not that I've published all that much...<br/><br/>1. I'll playtest as soon as it's halfway playable. I don't wait until it's polished.<br/>2.

You want to playtest it like that until you and your group are consistently having fun and the game is doing what you want it to do. I think it would be helpful for you to GM for a while if your game has that role, and then let someone else in the group do it if someone is willing. That will help you see the game from both sides.<br/><br/>You're not just looking for mechanics that don't work. You want to keep an eye on what the players do. How are they dealing with the processes? Often players will adopt procedures for engaging with a mechanic that you can include in the game to make the mechanic easier to understand.<br/><br/>You also want to keep an eye on any parts of the game that confuse them or seem counterintuitive. Those are sticking points. You'll have to evaluate whether they are accomplishing what you want (which means you probably need to rework your text to make the procedure easier to understand) or whether it's simply creating an unnecessary stumbling block and needs to go.<br/><br/>Wait to do outside or blind playtesting until you feel the game plays exactly how you want it to play and you feel it's essentially finished. Outside playtesters aren't really there to test your rules (although they probably will find stuff that you'll want to fix). They're there to test the quality of your text. You need them to make sure that the text clearly communicates how to make a game work the same way it does at your table. Invariably you'll find that there were certain procedures you took for granted. You use the procedures to make the game awesome when you run or play it, but they didn't make it into the text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103403/#Comment_103403" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-17T06:38:45+00:00" title="October 17, 2007  6:38AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As someone who's playtested other people's games, I can say that there are things you can do to help the playtesters:<br/><br/>Ask specific questions about the game.  Don't just say "what did you think?", but also "Did you find X mechanic was useful, or tiresome?"<br/><br/>Don't expect playtesting to be fun.  It might be fun, but treat it as the playtesters helping you with work, not play.  I've been in a playtest where the game author was so nervous about us having fun that it made it really hard to concentrate on the game.  It was like he was selling us the game, rather than testing it.  Don't do that.<br/><br/>Flag mechanics you're not sure about when they come up.  It's easier to remember them and think about their effect on the game if you know to pay attention to them.  <br/><br/>Decide if you're going to tweak rules on the fly to make them work for that session, or stick with the rules as written to get a proper feel for them.  I don't know which of these is best, but it's probably a good idea to decide on one approach, and let the playtesters know.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103411/#Comment_103411" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-17T07:28:40+00:00" title="October 17, 2007  7:28AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 17, 2007 7:33AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everyone's hitting on the right methods, but I can put some phraseology on it:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first playtests that everyone is talking about are testing the "Alpha" version of the game. This stage is expected to have bugs, and the playtesters should be aware that the game is in this state. It's often hard to find playtesters for Alpha play, because the expectation is that the game will likely break down or suck in play. Reward these people with as many cheetoes as they want, because they're doing you an invaluable service. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere can be various Alpha versions, and the only real criteria is that it needs to have something to test. With the understanding that you're going to be doing testing on Alpha versions until you've tested a complete version of the system. "Complete" here meaning that you don't know that there's going to be any more coming along. There might be more, added after testing as a result, but there's no part that you know you are going to include that's not there. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can get an Alpha tested independently (by people other than yourself, and who you preferably aren't good friends with), that's great, but probably not all that neccessary. <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you've revised the final Alpha version, and you have a version written up that you think addresses every problem that came up in testing the Alpha version, that version is now your Beta version. The Beta is therefore complete, and should work without major problems. Though we expect that there will be minor problems. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can test this yourself, though this will often just be fun at this point (the game will be close enough that you as designer will be filling in any tiny gaps). This is the point where it's key to get independent playtesting. Because at this point you're too close to the game and in thinking that it must work as written to see the small problems. Independent playtesters will find these for you. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe "Ashcans" from the "Ashcan Front" are all Betas looking for independent playtesting. <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you've revised the game based on the feedback from the testers of the Beta version, and then tested this final Beta to see that these last revisions didn't introduce any new problems, then the game is done. <br/>\n<br/>\nResist the temptation to reject the feedback on playtests. Do not explain to testers why their observations are incorrect, or why the game is better the way it's written now than it would have to take into account their criticisms. Try as hard as possible to set your ego aside, and consider ways that you could improve the game to fix the issues seen by the playtesters. Because even if they're wrong somehow, your game will get better by considering the feedback, and working to adjust it. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, in practice, the above is the optimum process, and you might not find enough testers, at least not very easily. Do as much testing as you can at each stage, but don't fret if you don't have loads of tests. Just be sure you have at least some (it's a really bad idea to proceed to publishing with few or no tests at all). <br/>\n<br/>\nOne more bit of advice... nobody is going to steal your RPG. Don't make playtesters sign NDAs or go through other rigamarole. In fact, if people spread the playtest version all over the world, they're probably doing you a service. No matter how many beta versions are floating around out there, if you've actually improved the text through playtesting, then the final edition will be worth purchasing. And the free version will serve as advertising for the pay version. <br/>\n<br/>\nGenerally test in the open, and let everybody see the results. This has many benefits, and no downside. Sounds like you're already doing that with the Blog, but I just had to mention it so that you don't abuse your playtesters. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon brings up an imporant subject, which is how to get the feedback. Note that if you don't ask for it, they won't give it to you - you'll just get, "Thanks, good game!" One technique that I recommend is that right after the session that you have the individuals write down some feedback before disucssing things with the other players. This has two effects:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) It's an old Cop technique, and the intent is to ensure that each individual isn't infected with the other's ideas. Humans are social, and once one person says, "I think that the resolution mechanics are too heavy," lots of people will chime in agreeing, whether or not that was their real impression. You want their first impression, unadulterated by anyone else's opinion. <br/>\n<br/>\n2) Writing fires certain synaptic processes that are different than speaking. You want these impressions first. <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce they've written down their impressions (and this can be short, as we don't want to abuse), then they should discuss the game, and those impressions can be transmitted. You do want the adulterated version, because the discussion may bring out observations that might not otherwise arise. You just want to get the individual impressions first. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103477/#Comment_103477" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-17T13:06:05+00:00" title="October 17, 2007  1:06PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>One place to look is the latest episode of the Master Plan podcast (episode #17).

I personally prefer to have a debriefing session where I talk with my alpha playtesters, but learning how to debrief, actively listen, not be defensive about the game and the like are all learned skills and not something you may instantly have, so you'll have to practice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103500/#Comment_103500" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-17T14:35:13+00:00" title="October 17, 2007  2:35PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just want to add that however much hands-on playtesting you do, without hands-off playtesting <i>eventually</i> you might as well have just poured kerosene on your game and set it on fire for all the good you did it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103514/#Comment_103514" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-17T16:09:13+00:00" title="October 17, 2007  4:09PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm glad I don't eat cheerios, Jason. =P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SabreCat" title="SabreCat"><img alt="SabreCat" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://cheri.shyou.org/~sabrecat/images/msuttner-storygames_tani.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SabreCat">SabreCat</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103526/#Comment_103526" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-17T18:18:04+00:00" title="October 17, 2007  6:18PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks vastly for your input, everyone!  I can grok the alpha/beta testing model, that should be really helpful.  I think I can scrape together at least a couple of playtest groups for the early phases, so I'm looking forward to it!  I expect to have procedures of play banged out enough to alpha playtest within a few weeks.<br/><br/>I'll see about listening to those podcasts this weekend.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103527/#Comment_103527" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-17T18:28:39+00:00" title="October 17, 2007  6:28PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With our frankensystem we started playtesting pretty much right away -- in fact the whole thing started with the bizarre question "do you think we could use SotC to make Traveller characters?" so the first playtest was just character generation.  So since then we've been playtesting piecemeal -- as a subsystem comes together we test it in isolation rigorously then set it aside and work on the next subsystem.  After many months we are only just starting to put together whole actual games and that's shaken out more bugs and spurred more subsystem-only sessions.  I'm almost at the stage now where I want to hand the whole thing to someone else and see if they get the same kind of game out of it that we do.  I guess that's "beta".<br/><br/>Our testing goes on with *tons* of communication.  There's discussion at the table before we begin to decide what we want to find out.  Then there's discussion to design the experiment to uncover what we want to know.  Then the test.  Then a post mortem discussion.  Then notes/changes on the wiki followed by a storm of email and wiki-borne commentary.  Rinse, lather repeat.<br/><br/>Of course, our process may never actually lead to a game so I'm not going to claim it represents any kind of "best practice".  But it's fun as hell.  <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
