I have rewritten it a couple of times. I thought that for the Business Card Game I would strip it down.<br/><br/>I realize that there isn't much here and the spacing on the charts blows, but what don't you understand? Does the token for opposition work in place of the GM?<br/></i><br/>Tiny Spies BC<br/><br/>Your characters are spies. You can do all of the spy things from books and movies. Your character has one of five specialties. SAS is good for combat, Spook is for sneaking, tracking and being someone else, Thief, is good for stealing, Face which is good for convincing people, And Boffin which is good for fixing things.  You are good at one thing and bad at another.<br/><br/>Making the plan.  The plan, which will have five steps, is decided by the team. based on the mission generated from the chart provided. Improvise a mission based on the<br/><br/>        who / what / where /  thing<br/><br/>1   Dissident / Steal / Dock / Code Word<br/>2    Doctor / Kidnap / Public Bath / Weapon<br/>3    Scientist / Substitute / Warehouse / Data<br/>4    Assassin / Rescue / Opera / Microfilm<br/>5    President / Destroy / Lodge / Weapon<br/>6    Noble / Find / Embassy / Blueprints<br/><br/>To start a scene, decide what they are trying to accomplish. Each player involved in the scene will roll one die for that. They will also roll one die for the opposition. They will roll one die to move the scene forward. And one die if they could get hurt. If they are using either there specialty or their disadvantage or a bonus die, explained later, there will be another die rolled. Each player rolls all of their dice and decides which dice they want to put toward which outcomes.<br/><br/>           Goal / Opposition / Damage / Scene<br/><br/>1       Fail / 2 tokens / Dead / bad guy<br/>2       Fail  / 1 token / Forever  / trap<br/>3       Complication / 1 token / Rest Of game / Clue<br/>4       Complication / NPC +1 / Next Scene / Clue<br/>5       Succeed / None / None / Out<br/>6       Succeed / None / None / Out<br/><br/>Tokens go in the center and can be used by any player to introduce opposition. Player who introduces the opposition keeps the token to use as a bonus die later. All unused tokens are divided between players in last scene.<br/><br/>Bad guy means introduce new NPC. Trap means the scene was known by the enemy and laid as a trap. Damage puts character at -1for the period of time                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
