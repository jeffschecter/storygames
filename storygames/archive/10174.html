My friend James and I decided to just ask the new players what sort of media/story they were interested in.  After some discussion it was decided they'd like to play something set in the dark ages with vampires, werewolves, and zombies with some sort of vague apocalypse theme.  I suggested that we try the Pool even though none of us have tried it before.  I thought a simple system that supports a story oriented approach would be ideal, and everybody seemed excited about trying it.<br/><br/>James is running the game, and he proposed one change to the Pool's rules--he wasn't so excited about people losing all the dice they risked if they failed to roll a one.  He thought that ones would remain successes, but you would only lose the pool dice that you rolled sixes on.  I'm not sure how that might effect play so does anybody who's a Pool veteran have any ideas?  <br/><br/>We generated out characters the other night and chatted about the setting a bit more.  We're going to play next week.<br/><br/>Also any other advice about the pool as a system for new player might be useful. <br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225825/#Comment_225825" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-19T11:21:41+00:00" title="August 19, 2009 11:21AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you only lose dice on which you have sixes, you will likely have a shit-ton of successes most of the time because your die pool economy tilts toward keeping pools high and the sense of risk low.  IMO that will make conflicts feel much less significant and suspenseful.  This may be a personal preference thing, but all the variants of the Pool I've read keep some form of volatile dice economy to drive the game.  I think it's a critical piece of the game, and recommend you play it straight first to benchmark it before tweaking the rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_225911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin" title="Kropotkin"><img alt="Kropotkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin">Kropotkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225911/#Comment_225911" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-19T12:43:16+00:00" title="August 19, 2009 12:43PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Would limiting the default pool to 6 (instead of 9) make any difference?<br/><br/>One thing I realized is that this variant allows you to roll both successes and failures simultaneously.  One of the dice throws I made with five dice rolled three sixes and two ones.

Hence the utility of playing it straight first to get a bead on how it operates on the table.  That said, it's very tinkerable.  I've just played a few games--Wushu, for instance--where I tinkered before actually playing the default rules, and by doing so unearthed a ton of odd undesired results.  You could just as easily start with a tinkered version and use that as your benchmark.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_225976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225976/#Comment_225976" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-19T14:22:11+00:00" title="August 19, 2009  2:22PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding your suggested rule: I agree with Jim/Hexabolic.<br/><br/>My preference is the Anti-Pool variant, which reverses the standard rule: instead of losing your committed Pool when you fail, you only lose your committed Pool dice when you succeed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225977/#Comment_225977" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-19T14:22:11+00:00" title="August 19, 2009  2:22PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding your suggested rule: I agree with Jim/Hexabolic.<br/><br/>My preference is the Anti-Pool variant, which reverses the standard rule: instead of losing your committed Pool when you fail, you only lose your committed Pool dice when you succeed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aik" title="Aik"><img alt="Aik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aik">Aik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226044/#Comment_226044" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-19T18:40:34+00:00" title="August 19, 2009  6:40PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your variant sounds a bit like The Puddle, which I wouldn't recommend.

You can happily run through a session of the Pool gambling zero dice one every single roll, then suddenly you hit something you want to win, and the tension is palpable as you agonise over how many dice to risk. For another player, every roll might be important, and they'll face that delicious agony every single roll.<br/>Your variant, and the Puddle, don't have that, and it's very important to the feel of the pool, in my experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226285/#Comment_226285" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-20T12:20:23+00:00" title="August 20, 2009 12:20PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An amusing bit of synchronicity: this thread on playing Lady Blackbird, which has a Pool that works exactly like Anti-Pool variant:<br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=10169&amp;page=1#Item_8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=10169&amp;page=1#Item_8</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226286/#Comment_226286" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-20T12:20:23+00:00" title="August 20, 2009 12:20PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 20, 2009 12:24PM by NomdePlume.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            double post                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin" title="Kropotkin"><img alt="Kropotkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin">Kropotkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227035/#Comment_227035" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T00:46:00+00:00" title="August 24, 2009 12:46AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2009 12:47AM by Kropotkin.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played tonight and after some discussion at the table about what version of the Pool we were going to use, we ended up using the standard pool rules.
