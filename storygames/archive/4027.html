I'm thinking how I might do that.<br/><br/>Also, I have a game. It's called A Reason To Murder, it's being playtested, and it's early days, but it's looking good.<br/><br/>So my worry is: next GenCon, should I be thinking about The Ashcan Collective or the Forge Booth? (It's a rhetorical worry, not a question to be answered, you understand.)<br/><br/>(Of course, neither of those booths may exist next year. But let's assume, for the moment, that they will, and that they'd both have me.)<br/><br/>If I'm honest, I'd be most at home at The Ashcan Collective. I'm greatly in favour of games that are playtested to death: so, if I'm acting with integrity, A Reason To Murder should be tested to death. I'd playtest it through next year, then present it as an ashcan at GenCon.<br/><br/>Having said that...<br/><br/>The Forge Booth is where it all happens. I'd learn a <i>hell</i> of a lot from joining The Forge Booth. Again, I'd playtest it through next year and, indeed, many designers playtest their games in that period of time. I'd polish it up, get artwork, and present it as a finished product. <br/><br/>I'm not particularly looking for an answer, here, or advice. But I think it's fascinating. And I imagine it's something that other people wonder about too.<br/><br/>Note that <i>pressure</i> to present it as a finished product. And, it must be said, much of that pressure comes because the Forge booth is there. I'd love to be a part of it. But, to do that, I need a finished product. And aaaargh.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90040/#Comment_90040" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-24T05:28:35+00:00" title="August 24, 2007  5:28AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You don't have to decide today, Graham.  Shooting for a Gen Con release in any form is not wise, trust me.  Ashcan Front games are supposed to be <i>almost </i>finished, so there is an expectation there just as solid in my mind as the Forge booth.  The bar is pretty high, based on the quality of this year's ashcans.  Spend the next six months refining your game and playtesting as hard as you can, then re-assess - that's my advice.  By then you'll have a much better idea whether 90% or 100% is a more appropriate goal.  <br/><br/>Also, I'm not convinced that the Forge booth is "where it all happens" any more.  It's happening all over the place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90064/#Comment_90064" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-24T07:00:57+00:00" title="August 24, 2007  7:00AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daniel Solis effectively sold at least 20-40 copies of his game "DO" (if not more) by simply walking around and demoing it for friends and strangers, entirely off the grid.

But who cares? I mean it's not like he's setting up a stand in the hall. All he'd have to do to make it technically not against the rules would be to step outside the convention hall whenever he wanted to make the actual transactions. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe rule isn't really intended to stop small-scale commerce. It's intended to prevent people from co-opting space at the con without paying for it. If it was generally allowed, then every "Open Gaming" table would have a guy with his POS adverts, hawking from the table. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note, Graham, like the playcollective this year, the ashcan booth might end up right across the alley from the Forge Booth. It wasn't too far off from there as it was. And, maybe more importantly, you're slapping both Matt and Paul in the face by saying that their booth isn't happening. They're both Forge Booth veterans, and their products sold very well, especially considering what they are. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't think you'd be missing anything by being at the Ashcan Front. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing to look at is where your game is at. If it's still in need of playtesting, make it an ashcan and sell it from either booth. If it's complete, sell it at The Forge booth. Or the Playcollective booth, if they'll have you. Or at whatever other site pops up next year. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou don't really have any bad options here. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90155/#Comment_90155" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-24T11:42:14+00:00" title="August 24, 2007 11:42AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When i first heard about the ashcan front i thought it was a great idea, but at the time i had it in my schedual that Sweet Agatha would be long printed by the time gencon rolled around. I wasn't happy with my product when it came time in my schedual to print so i asked paul and matt if i could join up.<br/><br/>A year of playtesting is a LONG time for me, but the way i work isn't the way you work, isn't the way Luke Crane works, isn't the way Andy K. works. You've got to go through your process and just see where your at. I made the decision in mid july. It worked out fine. I sold what i expected at the Ashcan front, and i didn't worry to much about the forge booth. <br/><br/>Let me just say, double dipping was a bit of a mistake, i should have focused just on the ashcan front, i didn't have the time to give myself whole heartedly to both booths and my sales and sanity suffered a little for it.

I've run a couple playtests and am currently revising v. 1.2 of the playtest document. I plan to run many more, refining and re-writing after each test.<br/><br/>I set this year's GenCon as a <i>promotional</i> deadline to spread the word about the game and drive traffic to the site. Fred Hicks had a cool guerrilla marketing scheme that I implemented, handing out promotional materials to all the cool, talkative folks in the indie scene and to a connection I had at the GM HQ. I actually only ran one playtest at GenCon. I wanted to chillax a bit since next year will be a working convention.<br/><br/>Like you, I'm setting next year's GenCon as a launchdate. Three to six more months of rigorous alpha playtesting, followed by three months of public beta playtesting, followed by three months of production time, with promotional support throughout the year seems is a loose and manageable schedule for me.<br/><br/>At the end of it all, I hope to have my game suitable for sale at a Forge/IPR/Indie-Collective booth. If the aforementioned schedule gets derailed, such as by an impassable mechanical dilemma that isn't resolved by beta playtesting, I'll shift my focus to the Ashcan Front.<br/><br/>I hope that gives you some idea of one way to go about it. I have no idea if it'll be successful. :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GMSkarka" title="GMSkarka"><img alt="GMSkarka" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v385/GMSkarka/tinyadamant.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GMSkarka">GMSkarka</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90465/#Comment_90465" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-25T21:43:37+00:00" title="August 25, 2007  9:43PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For what it's worth Daniel, everything I heard regarding the playtest you ran makes me think that you won't have any difficulty making that schedule.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister" title="ihmcallister"><img alt="ihmcallister" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister">ihmcallister</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90676/#Comment_90676" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T10:27:16+00:00" title="August 27, 2007 10:27AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could wear a pinstripe suit for Mob Justice.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/><br/>Iain                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

All he'd have to do to make it technically not against the rules would be to step outside the convention hall whenever he wanted to make the actual transactions.<br/><br/>The rule isn't really intended to stop small-scale commerce. It's intended to prevent people from co-opting space at the con without paying for it. If it was generally allowed, then every "Open Gaming" table would have a guy with his POS adverts, hawking from the table.</blockquote>\nWell, yes and no. They certainly could revoke your badge for selling "offsite" if they found out about it. It has happened in the past (or at least been threatened). Also, to sell outside the exhibit hall, you'd need a street-vendor's license from Indianapolis, as well as whatever state permits are required. Selling in the hotel is almost certainly expressly fordbidden, unless you get explicit permission, and could get you in trouble--maybe even booted from your room. And still requires an IN state permit. And something as big as Gen Con, or the convention center itself, might've bought out any rights to sales immediately in front of the convention center, making that illegal outright.<br/><br/>Different management, but we nearly got in trouble for selling 2 copies (and we'd only brought 2 with us to the convention, so it's not like they merely caught us quickly) of the ashcan of Four Colors al Fresco at Origins, a few years back. And, at least on paper, they have virtually identical rules about such things. <br/><br/>And, yes, it *is* intended to stop small-scale commerce. That's why you can't generally sell M:tG cards on-site (other than in designated areas/to designated people). Also, 20-40 copies of a new game isn't "small scale"--that's respectible sales for a new indie game at a booth at GenCon. All of which isn't to say you'd get caught, just that no one should have the illusion that even if they're caught, nothing could possibly come of it.<br/><br/>But, i see that it has been clarified that what i initially read Andy as saying is correct: no actual sales occurred, just hooking people so they'd go buy it elsewhere (and, in this case, once it was available). That is perfectly legal, much cheaper than even sharing a booth, doesn't involve being tied down to a booth, and potentially just as effective.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91640/#Comment_91640" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T08:55:23+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  8:55AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm planning to have an ashcan by GenCon 2008.
