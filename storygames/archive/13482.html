We are in the Spring 1902, Orders phase with the following diplomatic relations in place.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrance: France is openly looking to create incredibly short term alliances and quickly betrayed England. On the other hand they are completley of the opinion that I am working directly in their benefit and want to swing up and to the right.<br/>\n<br/>\nEngland: I want England to occupy France for me in the short/long term so I can safely conquer Germany , so I have been feeding them information from France regarding general information on Frances motives.<br/>\n<br/>\nAustria: Austria and myself have been working together from the start of things. Our plans are to divide the map in half as we fan out in either direction. I am moving my fleet in Tunisia to wards turkey to help support Austria and further solidify our alliance.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy thoughts for this turn are to move Munich to Berlin, and shift Tyrolia and Venice 1 space north each. My thoughts are that if Germany focuses on England I will be wide open for the attack and next order phase just support another unit into Munich, or if they focus an attack on Munich I will simply retreat into Berlin and then retake Munich while surrounding it by 3 sides. Overall my goal is to capture Germany and then swing down into France from the North while pushing in from Italy. The two sided attack should theoretically put the pinch on him.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust curious what your thoughts are in regards to stretching myself out north. Thanks for any advice.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304124/#Comment_304124" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-12T21:24:32+00:00" title="December 12, 2010  9:24PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Weird of Russia to not build in StP after he knew that he was bounced by Germany while England didn't take Norway. Lost opportunity there.<br><br>The French position is such that a short-to-mid-term alliance with Turkey against Italy and Austria could be very fruitful. I wouldn't trust him enough as Italy; were I to stretch myself to my utmost in some other war, France would be certain to pounce at the opportunity. Specifically any diplomacy predicated on a French fleet just sitting about in the western Med area is crazy talk - Italy can't operate in full security as long as France has the extremely lucrative Italian option open.<br><br>As for attacking Germany, the long-term effects of a crumbling Germany (the inevitable result of you putting pressure to his weak flank) seem adverse for Italy: as England and France have superiorly secure positions and France has a favourable front against Italy, the likely after-war shakedown would seem to be that France attacks Italy while England grabs the northern German possessions; Italy will have a non-favourable tactical position in defending whatever SCs she conquers in Germany, and will find it necessary to relinquish the central position in favour of retreating to the peninsula. Afterwards the German power vacuum is filled by the Powers that are geographically suited to annexing the German sphere: England grabs the coastal properties for the most part, and then either England, Russia or France becomes the new bigwig central Power, pushing the front out east/west, away from their home SCs and secure board borders they can fall back on.<br><br>Meanwhile I have difficulty perceiving stable mission parameters in an Italian continental adventure; merely holding Munich is a neutral gain, as you can't take the unit you use to possess the place out of there without losing it. Extending the possessions to Berlin takes you very far out of your own base of power, meaning that you'd still need to occupy both Munich and Berlin to even slow down the likes of Russia, who won't have much preventing them from putting two units into the business of conquering Berlin from you. In fact, the first roughly defensible geopolitical position, and thus the logical end-goal of a northern war, is the possession of all three German home SCs; it would be theoretically possible to build a solid peace in the area if Italy could grab those three quickly with an English alliance, with England occupying Denmark and the Netherlands. Follow up with an English push at StP (natural from that position) and a joint attack on France, and the German occupation would be slightly tenable. Of course all this is extremely optimistic, and you need to go through quite a number of steps to get there, and even then you end up with a pretty disparate Power that has to fight long way from home while also defending fronts relatively close to the home SCs; not nearly as good as holding territory evenly to all directions from your base of power.<br><br>For the above reasons I do not usually consider Germany seriously as territory to be kept when I play Italy. Rather, what I do when I make the easy Munich grab is, I time it to weaken an otherwise dominant Germany, to throw out the timing of whatever western coalition he belongs in, and to take a tempo advantage: by grabbing Munich and then abandoning the place I take the benefit of one build for one year, a benefit that can be bartered into a surprise attack on Austria or France - this succeeds surprisingly often, as most Austrian players haven't thought along the above lines, and they'll rather assume that I'll have my hands full when I engage myself into a German war. The trick here is to realize that an Italy in Munich is not in war with Germany, he's just claiming a tempo advantage and then retreating to his natural hunting areas along the Mediterranean and in East Europe; Germany won't follow up on the Munich tempo claim unless he's an idiot, as he doesn't have a tactically feasible attack vector on Italy himself - best for him to just grit his teeth, congratulate Italy for having been rational enough to retreat on his own, and go on with his own game.<br><br>What makes your position tricky is that Austria is on the brink of collapse, and thus it's not favourable for you to make the obvious stab at him; the Juggernaut will kill you after engulfing Austria if you attack him now. For this reason my own play here, assuming no diplomatic reasoning, would be to see if Germany wants to attack France, or simply to Silesia and Bohemia in an effort to support Austria against Russia. The former move would be predicated on Mun-Bur, Tun-Wes, Ven-Pie; not ideal with your current unit composition, as you have one army too many and one fleet too few, but perhaps fruitful if Germany (and perhaps England) can be relied upon to take advantage. The other play is difficult in that you don't really have any immediate gains to be made by moving towards Warsaw, but at least it completely rewrites the Russian expectations of the power relationships; at the moment he's looking at that map and thinking to himself that he and the Turk have Austria completely overpowered, especially after his new army build. It's conseivable that Austria could push you into Greece this year in exchange for you relinquishing your position in Munich; put your fleet into convoy position, have Austria move to Albania and see how the Turk moves.<br><br>In any case you should be greatly conserned about the Turkish position, it's relatively rather powerful; Turkey is a strong country that gets disproportionate amounts of leverage out of SCs in comparison to others; a Turkey that's managed by some magical means to just march into Greece with an army is in excellent position to put further pressure on Austria, especially as the Austrian fleet's not anywhere near the Turkish coasts.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304127/#Comment_304127" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-12T21:58:55+00:00" title="December 12, 2010  9:58PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yea I kind of sea Austria falling myself, and am hoping they act as a temporary buffer for now. I think your advice of bulking up my fleet might be a good idea. Given your advice I'm thinking of moving on turkey, and offering the rest of germany to france. I am thinking that possibly if I put some pressure on turkey I might be able to tempt Russia into splitting their focus. It may be best to just leave the west to fumble around on itself and move in a direction with less resistance.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy hope with having so many armies was to draw peoples focus away from the sea so that I could slip in and hit them from either side.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304128/#Comment_304128" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-12T22:12:04+00:00" title="December 12, 2010 10:12PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing to consider in the strategic realm of things is the notion of progressive strategic arc: Diplomacy is, aside from some neutral SCs, a zero-sum game. This means that all advantages come at the expense of other players. Furthermore, there is no entropy in Diplomacy for the most part, all advances are reversible. This in turn means that players can cooperate to counter-act any advantages taken by other players, and thus they can prevent the game from proceeding.<br><br>However, there is still a progressive arc to the game due to the one factor that cannot be reversed: when a Power dies out, this represents a genuine entropy on the board: where once was a Power with a vested interest in a territory now resides a power vacuum that may be filled by the other players, who have dissimilar interests in the area that is not their home territory.<br><br/>What the above implies is that the game of Diplomacy only genuinely advances towards its end by the elimination of Powers. This is important to understand when deriving strategic principles because successful strategy, I find, is founded on controlling the entropy and slowing it down so as to ensure that you personally keep abreast of the developments: when a Power dies off the board, you need to ensure that it is one that leaves a Power vacuum you are uniquely suited to fill at the expense of everybody else.<br/><br/>This gives rise to my own favoured strategic framework: attack the dominant Power, support weaker parties, seek your own advantage by expanding your domain in defensible, clearly defined stages. Use a given Power's difficulties and weakness as leverage for allying with them on favourable terms instead of trying to savage them, for they will fight any challengers with determination.<br/><br/>The above sort of thinking is the basis for why I would ally myself with Austria and Germany in your stead: the corner Powers are currently strong and blatantly cooperative towards each other (that shared Anglo-Russian attitude towards the north is not natural, for instance), which enables them to put crushing pressure on the central Powers. The situation enables other Powers to cause power vacuums they can use to grow into major Powers while you stay still if you're not careful. This is why it's important for you to try to keep Germany and Austria in the game instead of hastening their demise; Italy is by nature poorly suited to an aggressive game that seeks to hasten enthropy, as your domain is not naturally expandable to cover any other player's the way the corner Powers can. For this reason you want to slow down the game until your naturally slow development is counteracted by your ability to fight on both sides of the board as necessity dictates.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
