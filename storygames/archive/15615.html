And, yes, we make all of those jokes. Because Neal hasn't really played before, we do a bit more rules talk than normal, but it's more of a refresher than anything else. Jeff has fun with another overbearing character and in the end, a fight breaks out in Admiral Flint's Quarters.<br/><br/><a href="http://media.podcastingmanager.com/2/0/6/6/8/295141-286602/Media/rsg038_Flames18.mp3" rel="nofollow">Download Here</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
