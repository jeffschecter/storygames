If this already exists somewhere on Story Games, then sorry for asking again.<br/><br/>I am thinking of running Lady Blackbird, and I am new to games that give narrative control to players. Previously I've run and played D&amp;D, Savage Worlds and a number of other systems that generally assume the player is only responsible for what they do and how they do it.<br/><br/>I've been reading as much as I can about modern (indie) RPG design, which is what led me to Lady Blackbird. In a number of places I've found people expressing the idea that the person who introduces a conflict shouldn't be the one who resolves it. This makes sense to me. You want to have interesting obstacles in a story, but if the players are advocates for a single character (as they are in this game) then they will be torn between making an interesting challenge and doing what is best for their character.<br/><br/>Which leads me to this part of Lady Blackbird's text, which lists examples of questions for the GM to ask:<br/><br/>\u201cDoes anything break when you do this crazy maneuver?\u201d<br/>\u201cThe fire probably spreads out of control doesn\u2019t it?\u201d<br/>\u201cThat sounds like a bold plan. What\u2019s the first step?\u201d<br/>\u201cDo the two of you end up somewhere quiet together? Does something<br/>happen between you?\u201d<br/>\u201cDo you know anything about the Crimson Sky rebels? What are they<br/>like? Is it normal for them to be this far into the Empire?\u201d<br/><br/>Now the 3rd, 4th and 5th questions seem like fine things to ask my players. They give control of the character's intentions, actions, and backstory to the player. Additionally, it makes sense for me for the players to freely improvise the setting of The Wild Blue Yonder. Even in ways that are intended to introduce the potential for future kinks in the story. For example, inventing the notion of zombie sky squid as a thing that they have heard rumours of. The players are kind of setting themselves up there for that to happen, but that's okay - it's still in the GM's hand to go for it or not.<br/><br/>What I'm not certain about is the first two questions. I would really appreciate it if someone could take the time to explaining how they see this working - perhaps with a longer example. Another example I have been pondering: I am totally happy for the players to describe the Owl, improvise what they have in it, even list the flaws with the ship. But should I start the game with asking them to describe the cell they are imprisoned in (beyond at a cosmetic level)?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416490/#Comment_416490" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-17T12:28:05+00:00" title="June 17, 2013 12:28PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Martin!<br/><br/>Great question. For my own taste, I prefer to keep player roles inside the characters' skins (so to speak) -- their thoughts, feelings, memories, and actions. So they wouldn't describe the cell they're imprisoned in, but you might ask Vance's player if he remembers anything about the security of Imperial brigs. Lady Blackbird plays well in this mode.<br/><br/>I included those first two questions as an indication that there's a bit of gray area here. Some people like to slip just a bit outside the character sometimes -- they might describe the problems created when they roll a failure, say. It's a matter of taste, and the game will function across a pretty broad spectrum. Go with your gut, and the vibe at the table, and it'll work out fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416491/#Comment_416491" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-17T12:47:06+00:00" title="June 17, 2013 12:47PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 17, 2013 4:48PM by MartinEden.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks <a href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">@John_Harper</a>, appreciate the quick and helpful response.

It's not really the players that make up all that, it's you - the GM. It's you that give them permission to describe about a given subject.<br/><br/>I do agree with the difference in the first and second question and the rest. That's an interesting notion. The thing is that some leading questions are just GM descriptions.  You could as easily have told them "The ladder breaks" or "A fire starts" but because you ask the players, you involve them by giving them permission to say no. If it's not specifically about their character, they will in 99.99 % of the time accept what you asked and build on that.<br/><br/>The questions are a pedagogic way to teach <i>offer</i> and <i>acceptance</i>. I.e. when someone offers by describing an action or an environment, the others will hopefully accept that and build on it. A bad relation in a group will instead <i>block</i> by saying "no". You could later on take this one step further where you don't even have to ask questions because the whole group will play as if they were having a fruitful conversation. Person A says something, person B answers on that and person C build on what have been said. There are techniques to form this kind of playstyle within the group. I wouldn't however worry about that for now. Try running the game and then build from that experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Terwox" title="Terwox"><img alt="Terwox" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/nSPMQ33PX1PEF.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Terwox">Terwox</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416509/#Comment_416509" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-17T15:01:55+00:00" title="June 17, 2013  3:01PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you want to stay closer to the line, you could ask questions like "What broke when you did that crazy maneuver?" and "Where has the fire spread out of control to?"

It means that you've already said to the player, "Look, the bad stuff <em>is</em> going to happen", so that they aren't spending their effort trying to avoid it. Which instead frees them to just enjoy the bad stuff that's part of the story and relish coming up with their own ideas for the form it takes.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416573/#Comment_416573" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-18T07:03:20+00:00" title="June 18, 2013  7:03AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that encouraging players to be just as narratively engaged and creative in their own failures has huge rewards: it'll both get them more excited about failure as something that causes satisfying dramatic escalation*, rather than a negative, it'll help keep the game unpredictable and feral, and create ways in which the characters need to help each other.<br/><br/>* Part of the reason you want to make failure fun in LB is that, systematically, it's really easy to avoid.
