Besides the web-site, how have you generated buzz? <br>\n<br>\nAnd looking at the web-site... two things:<br/>\n1. It took me a sec to get the humor of the page, and I almost didn't find the actual details on what the game is about below. <br/>\n2. As for what the site says the game is about... sounds like... Victorian D20... which it's probably not. Basically the data there does little to distinguish the game in any way that would grab me - or much of anyone, I'd think. I already have Falkenstein, in two editions...<br/>\n<br/>\nMight be an incredible game. How would I know? Did you do public playtesting? Have you posted any actual play of your own? Did you do any of the design in the open where people would discuss the game? You may have done all of these, I've not been over at the Forge recently. But somehow, if you have, it's not translating into buzz. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89102/#Comment_89102" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T09:37:45+00:00" title="August 21, 2007  9:37AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me the are, more or less, three reasons:\n<ol>\n<li>I haven't really heard much about it.</li>\n<li>I have neither the time nor the money to just buy random games to check them out.</li>\n<li>Any d20 game has to be really interesting or receive really great reviews to get me to buy it, as the chances to actually get play out of it are low.</li>\n</ol>\nNot really all that helpfull, I know.

I gave up after the first couple of sentences because I shouldn't have to work that hard just to get an idea of what the game is about.  The character sheet design is very amateurish (particularly the 6x9 version, although the actual book is much better, judging from the demo pdf), the first thing I usually look at is the character sheet as that's what I'm going to be looking at during play and it looks awful.<br/><br/>So although I hadn't heard of it, if I <i>had</i> I probably wouldn't have looked any further because the first two things I look at (game blurb and character sheet) are both so off-putting.

I love the cover!"<br/>\n- Booth: "Victorian style, think League of Extraordinary Gentlemen with dimensional travel."<br/>\n- Me: "Cool. What's that big decapitated monster head on the cover?"<br/>\n- Booth: "Not sure."<br/>\n- Me: "What are the rules like?"<br/>\n- Booth: "D20"<br/>\n- Me: "Ack, umm.. how do the rules evoke the setting?" (I've been burned on D20 too much, and Mutants and Masterminds does everything I want with it, and 4th Edition is coming out soon, and none of my D&amp;D; friends will play it because it isn't D20 they know and many of my indy friends will shy from it because it is D20.)<br/>\n- Booth: "I'm not sure."<br/>\n- Me: "hmmm..." (almost 300 pages, that's pretty involved for a game I know nothing about) "can anyone run a demo?"<br/>\n- Booth: ::looks for someone who can run a demo:: "Sorry, no one is available who knows how to run it."<br/>\n- Me: "I'll see what people are saying online and I may come back. Thanks for you time."<br/>\n<br/>\nMy thoughts looking at the website:<br/>\n<br/>\n- The logo is aliased poorly and has jagedy white edges. This doesn't look professional.<br/>\n- The cover is cool but at that size it looks like Mortal Coil.<br/>\n- I can't click on the cover to see a larger image.<br/>\n- "Passages" sounds passive.<br/>\n- Why is the text all bold?<br/>\n- Ack, the rollover on the top have gray floating animated boxes... looks very strange!<br/>\n- "Adventures penned by legendary giants" is very hard to read.<br/>\n- Saying "fiendishly clever" annoys me if it isn't a quote from a third party.<br/>\n- "Blue Devil\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Passages", wait, I thought it was called "Passages", who is Blue Devil?<br/>\n- "Dainty. Palatable. Non-Constipating." - WTF?<br/>\n- "The only Game Preparation which is uninjurious to the digestion because of the slow measured absorption of rules and use of a singular icosahedron for resolution. The only Game Preparation of agreeable taste to all palates, and an excellent substitute for Cod-Liver oil. Prescribed by eminent practitioners to lymphatic and scrofulous children; to adolescents for troubles associated with growth, amenorrhoea, etc.; to adults for asthma, syphilis, and female hysteria; and to all ages for chronic bouts of ennui." - WTF? If I wasn't reviewing this for this thread, I would have left at this point.<br/>\n- What's that bullseye, is this game sold at Target?<br/>\n- Who is Robert Louis Stevenson, Professor Gibberne, Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, and Jules Gabriel Verne? Why should I care what they have to say?<br/>\n- " Lifetime supply now only $32.95!" That's a lot for an indie game I know nothing about. I'm willing to do an impulse buy if it is $22 or less. More than that I need more encouragement.<br/>\n- Ugly blue links.<br/>\n- Cool!!! Reviews from places I know with high scores! I'm starting to feel interested.<br/>\n- No actual play? Is no one playing?<br/>\n- Paul Tevis? He's a sexy man! Interest is further peaked!<br/>\n- "You can read about the development of Passages in our ongoing design diary" - AWESOME! I'm starting to get more excited!<br/>\n- WAIT... the design diary isn't a blog... it is text saved as JPGs? WTF? And then PDFs?<br/>\n- "\xc2\xa92004-07", cool, they have been around a while.<br/>\n- Why is the "Read, Hot &amp; Blue" banner on the top right have a weird background? Why does it look cut off? What does "Read, Hot &amp; Blue" mean?<br/>\n- If they didn't spend money on their website, what does the book layout look like?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy thoughts reading the review <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/12/12602.phtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/12/12602.phtml</a>:<br/>\n<br/>\n- This table should be on the website. It makes me want to play:<br/>\n<br/>\n* Nearly Certain (0). Jumping over a Lilliputian<br/>\n* Easy (5). Intimidating the Cowardly Lion<br/>\n* Average (10). Minding your manners at the Mad Hatter's tea party<br/>\n* Hard (15). Navigating the Nautilus through the English Channel<br/>\n* Challenging (20). Tracking Sher Khan through the jungle after a fresh rain<br/>\n* Daunting (25). Training White Fang to play dead<br/>\n* Heroic (30). Beating Professor Moriarty at a game of chess<br/>\n* Herculean (35). Persuading Ebeneezer Scrooge to loan you \xc2\xa310<br/>\n* Nearly Impossible (40). Seeing the Invisible Man<br/>\n<br/>\n- Score of 5/4 is good!<br/>\n- 296 pages... if it is more than 100 pages, it better be amazing!<br/>\n- I'm not lazy, but I just bought 20+ indie games at Gencon for over $340. I play a lot but still have trouble going through all my games and I would rather play more games than spend time with GM prep so the following made me nervous:<br/>\n<br/>\n"But there is also one big problem, and this is why I'm giving a substance score of 4 instead of 5. There is not enough information to start playing immediately. Either the narrator has read the works that inspired the game and has them fresh in her mind, or she will need a lot of work to prepare the adventures. This is a problem not exclusive to Passages, and other great games also have it. But I really believe that the book needed 20 more pages describing one of the alternate worlds, one alternate London or something else."<br/>\n<br/>\nand:<br/>\n<br/>\n"In conclusion, Passages is an excellent reading and great game that needs an extra effort from the narrator."<br/>\n<br/>\n- I really need games with situation generators.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that was helpful. I'm trying to be as honest as possible in the hopes this will be of some help.<br/>\n<br/>\nRock,<br/>\nJohn                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89123/#Comment_89123" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T10:39:51+00:00" title="August 21, 2007 10:39AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I saw it at GenCon, though I don't remember too much about it (it had many pages, and was sturdily constructed.

Thanks for all the responses so far. Your insight and input are genuinely appreciated. To be clear, I didn't start this thread to pimp the game (though, of course, I am happy to do so). Some responses:<br><br><b>1) AP: </b>This is really sort of a chicken-and-the-egg kind of thing. The general lack of interest (particularly in the S-G sector) would seem to be a good reason why there is not a lot of AP going on. I have two <a href="http://p212.ezboard.com/bbluedevilgames" rel="nofollow">Play-by-Post threads</a> on my messageboards. One is mine, and I had to put it on hiatus due to other time constraints; the other just got started. I intend on linking to them when there's a little more meat on the bone.<br><br><b>2) General Buzz:</b> Well, I guess this is the whole point. I've got a couple of very nice reviews on RPGnet, complimentary mentions from Paul and on Voice of the Revolution. I posted my design diaries on the site and posted notice on a couple of other sites. I'm open to/looking for ideas to build buzz.<br><br><b>3) Website/Product Page:</b> Some good thoughts here. The opening text is from the back cover. I think it works there, where the browser can flip through the book too. It's an entertaining way of conveying what the game is about, i.e., Victorian literary adventure. But I can definitely see why it <i>doesn't</i> work on the product page. I'll look into retooling. As for the character sheet, I was going for functional, but I guess it's time to call character-sheet maestro Fred Hicks?<br><br><b>4) d20:</b> This one is a very sticky issue. I think one of the problems with the game is that it stands between both "worlds", i.e., d20 and story-games. It's really a d20-story-game, i.e., both. I think some of what is happening (and seems to be borne out by some of the comments in this thread) is that the d20 folks think it's "too indie" and the S-G folks don't want to invest much time in an interation of d20. Thoughts on how I can show that the game can be satisfying to both? Is that even possible?<br><br><b>5) Genre/Theme: </b>It is a Victorian-era setting (though readily usable in other genres/settings), so there's not much I can do about that. As for theme, the idea is that the game supports wild, fast-paced adventure. I can see how the sell-text doesn't really express the <b>theme</b>. Thanks, Paul, that's a very helpful observation.<br><br><b>6) Graham:</b> (Because he really needs his own category, right?) When you say "shit", do you mean "stuff" or "bad stuff" or something else? I'm fine with blunt responses as long as I get teh meaining.<br><br><b>7) Title:</b> If it's not obvious, "passages" is a double-entendre, representing both passages of text/stories and the portals between the dimensions of the Book Without End. I can't very well change the title at this point. Should I be more explicit about its meaning or is that like trying to explain a joke that doesn't land?<br><br>As I said, thanks for all the input so far.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89130/#Comment_89130" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T10:50:29+00:00" title="August 21, 2007 10:50AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 21, 2007 10:50AM by C.W.Richeson.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/13/13185.phtml" rel="nofollow">Here's a link to my Passages review for anyone interested.</a><br><br>I keep track of the page impressions for my reviews and Passages got over 1,000 in about two weeks.

The demo was just running through combat. Now sure, it was vs. Professor Moriarty and his thugs, and there was a neat thing in there where you showed how the thugs were generated quickly, and you did simplify the die rolling mechanics with your Spread mechanic, but it didn't feel particularly literary.<br><br>When you were talking about people traveling through books, I immediately thought of <b>The Eyre Affair</b>, and associated other novels in the series. I was expecting an experience that felt more like I was playing in a book with characters in a book. Maybe I'm matching wits with Moriarty, or something. Moriarty is more of a brilliant, sneaky bastard, not the sort of guy I want to get into a shootout with. And shootouts don't say "Victorian novel" to me, anyway. Not as my 15 minute introduction to the game.<br><br>Basically, the demo didn't make me feel like this wasn't a game I could already be playing with D20 Modern and a little setting development on my own.<br><br>For what it's worth, many women I've talked to about game design (gamers and non-gamers) have remarked that they would love to play something that felt like <b>Pride &amp; Prejudice</b>, so I'm going to say that there is a market out there for Playing in Literary Victoriana, but this game, based on the demo I had, didn't feel Literary, and didn't feel particularly Victorian.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89133/#Comment_89133" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T10:56:23+00:00" title="August 21, 2007 10:56AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, I genuinely thought it was a game about poo.

(b) The page count/price issue is an interesting one. $32 for 300 pages is (I think) reasonable. By contrast, ZoZ is $30 for 200 pages. However, it's definitely counter to the indie paradigm. The high page count seems to be hurting it, which is surprising because it's definitely not bloated. (c) I did spend money on the website. It's been up for 3+ years now, and we've generally gotten good feedback on it, but I'll definitely take another look at the issues you've raised.<br><br>On a related note (to this thread), I had already decided on doing a free Narrator's Guide for download. Some of the issues raised in this thread will definitely be going in there.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

The demo was just running through combat.

There was definitely some cognitive dissonance in the demo. The literary aspect is supposed to come in with (1) use of elements from famous works (e.g., Moriarty and Wonderland); and (2) the wild narration that results from a "wide" randomizer like a d20, using spread as a measure of success/failure, and certainly plot points. While I think the demo <i>covers the bases</i>, I recognize that it does not hit a home run. (That's why I was happy to leave behind my demo kit for the last day; I'm going back to the dawing board for a full reboot.)\n<blockquote>For what it's worth, many women I've talked to about game design (gamers and non-gamers) have remarked that they would love to play something that felt like<b>Pride &amp; Prejudice</b>, so I'm going to say that there is a market out there for Playing in Literary Victoriana, but this game, based on the demo I had, didn't feel Literary, and didn't feel particularly Victorian.</blockquote>Well, one demo can't satisfy everybody's literary sweet spot. Perhaps I'll shoot for a few different demos and choose based on the stated interests of the demoee?

But these days I basically require my games to have a focus like My Life with Master or Dogs in the Vineyard or god something as awesomely tight as It Was A Mutual Decision.<br/><br/>So you're adventuring through Victorian lit.... to what end?

They are shifting through Victorian <b>stories</b>.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nThat's not only original, it's interesting. Just jumpin' around meeting and skirmishing with various fictional characters is as familiar as dirt; shit, they did it all the time on Star Trek, for Pete's sake. But entering the stories? H'mm. That's nifty. Every time you've explained the game to me, you were careful to say it exactly that way, and every time, it interested me.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut somehow, no one else seems to be getting this impression.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also know that a con demo can't often capture the subtlety of a game's concept. The other players and I did a few task rolls in the one you ran for us, and that was fine. Still, though ... if it had somehow made it clear that when we shifted from one place to another, we were literally entering another <i>text</i>, in some way which was not just clicking to another backdrop as in Mortal Kombat ... that would be cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot just altering the rules per story, either; there are plenty of games like that, and that's not what I mean. I'm thinking more metaphysically, as in, do characters' actions alter the <i>texts </i>they're in? Stuff like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet's take a harder look at GenCon, too. For one thing, you weren't there on Thursday and Friday. No shared buildup with the rest of the publishers and exhibitors, no sense of communality, no sharing of lessons learned or other experiences from those days. For another, you had to leave on Sunday. I announced that I could demo the game on Sunday morning, but at that point, I can only do so much in between last-minute make-ups for missed meetings and other necessary con stuff. If it'd come up, I woulda demo'ed it (like I did with Reign, on request), but it didn't.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow for the other thing, the good part. We talked on Friday, and on Saturday, you totally made good on your statements and self-imposed commitments from that conversation. It was fun and exciting to have you at the booth. You ran Passages, you played other stuff, you added to the booth culture, and rounded out the booth content (in terms of system). It is fair, I think, to say that if you'd been there doing that all four days, you would have moved 16 books on your own, and probably more given the spillover effect of mutual interactions among the pack of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nTherefore, "I sold only 4 books at GenCon" is not actually a fair assessment of how things went for you. <i>When </i>you did the Forge booth thing, it worked.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest, Ron<br/>\n<br/>\nedited 'cause I signed off twice                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89158/#Comment_89158" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T11:42:10+00:00" title="August 21, 2007 11:42AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 21, 2007 11:44AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Edited to note cross-post with Ron]<br>\n<br>\nA narrator's guide sounds like a good idea, both as an add-on to the support for the game, and as an advertisement. <br>\n<br>\nWhen you say that it's a story-game d20-game, that's intriguing. I was actually thinking the other day whether or not any of the d20 games out there had really accomlished this (Blue Rose comes to mind, possibly). If the play of the game doesn't always seem to be discovering this feature, then perhaps you can put some notes in the aforementioned narrator's guide to show how best to use the relevant mechanics. Which, again, will serve as advertising for this cool feature of the game. <br>\n<br>\nBecause, well, would you rather compete with other D20 products, or try to sell to Story-Gamers? I mean, you'll probably get some sales from the D20 front, as well. But at the Forge Booth, you'll probably do better selling to the alternative crowd. <br>\n<br>\nBut it's still a tough sell. If the elevator pitch is, as above, "Leauge of Extraordinary Gentlemen, plus interdimensional travel" I think - why not use SOTC? Oh, because of the interdimensional travel part? Well... what's in those other dimensions? Is it still Victorian there? <br>\n<br>\nThis seems to be the unique feature of the subject-matter - the dimension hopping which the game's name is supposed to invoke. But I can't imagine what that's like. Is it like the show "Sliders" where there's a new dilemma in each new dimension? Or...<br>\n<br>\nTo get people thinking about buying or trying the game, there's a very simple thing you have to do. Give them some sort of example concept that they can put into their mind, and envision themselves playing it. If somebody says, "Mormon Gunslingers in a Wild West that Never Was" it's not at all a cliche concept - quite unique, actually. But I get a vision of a dude holding a bible and a gun, and fighting for what he believes. <br>\n<br>\nWith the above tagline, I see Nemo from the movie version of LOEA, standing before a portal to... well, he's just standing there. I don't know why he's going, I don't know what sort of thing he's going to do on the other side... quite simply I can't envision what might happen. <br>\n<br>\nIs there some common enemy ("Time Morlocks" or something) that they fight in these other dimensions? If Moriarity is there, what's he up to? Can he affect our dimension from another? Or must he just be hiding out? Perhaps it's about chasing fugitive villains from literature across these dimensions to which they've escaped? Or something? <br>\n<br>\nSure, everyone here can imagine all sorts of things like this, too. But if you say, "Yes, it could be about that" then the game isn't really about those things. It doesn't support them in any way. As somebody mentioned above, when you say, "You can do anything," well, all I can respond is "Damn straight I can... now what is your game doing to help me do that? Why shouldn't I just use GURPs?" <br>\n<br>\nWhat did you encode in the game that makes it better than GURPS for this? <br>\n<br>\nAnd since the thread is about bluntness, if you can't say why it's better than GURPs (other than some people prefer D20), if you can't generate buzz on why it's better, you won't sell copies. Worse, if the game really doesn't do better than GURPS? Then we know why it isn't selling. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

I noted in our demo that even though the basic mechanic was certainly easy to use, we spent a lot of our time trying to figure out which traits we could bring in on a particular test, even trying to come up with justifications as to why we should able to drag in an additional trait. I think the game would do very well with a more streamlined system, one that describes competencies of characters rather than having everything broken down quite so much. It doesn't matter whether Alan Quatermain is awesome with knives or swords or his fists, it matters that he's good at fighting. <br/>\n<br/>\n2) I wanted more setting material. It's fine to say "Go look in Alice in Wonderland and make a cool adventure for that." But it's a hard thing to do from the standpoint of a GM. These are static texts that MIGHT give you a few ideas, but it would be amazingly helpful if there were more explanation in Passages as to how to turn a static story into a living breathing world, with changing characters. Additionally, I really, really wanted to see some example settings, because that was what originally intrigued me about your game. I wanted to see what you thought of Wonderland and how it interacted with Captain Nemo or Frankenstein or whatever. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, that's my two cents.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Piers" title="Piers"><img alt="Piers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Piers">Piers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89168/#Comment_89168" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T12:07:24+00:00" title="August 21, 2007 12:07PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Justin,<br/><br/>My reactions to Passages were much the same as many of those already mentioned in the thread, particularly those of Remi, Jesse and Paul (What's the theme? How does the system specificaly address the setting) and the general, turned off by d20 feel (I don't want to see tables listing the hardness and hit points of doors), but I also have some other side of the fence data that I thought might be useful.<br/><br/>I got my copy of Passages as part of a sort Christmas-came-late bundle, along with a whole bunch of other Story Games, including Spirit of the Century, Cold City, Burning Empires, The Zorceror of Zo, Don't Rest Your Head and others.  They came from a close friend of mine who was an Ennies Judge this year, and they came with a specific request.  He doesn't really know the Story Games field, but he wanted me to have a look over them and suggest which games stood out from the rest when considered as Story Games.  <br/><br/>Your game was one of the ones which I took a look at and said, this looks more like an traditional roleplaying game to me.  That doesn't mean it is a bad game, but my reflexive judgement was that if I was looking for innovation this wasn't where I was going to find it.<br/><br/>What is more pertinent you, however, is that he placed the book in the pile with the rest of the Story Games.  <br/><br/>I am not sure what about the game and its appearance impelled him to make that choice, but he did.  Which means that you may be suffering from a disconnect between the flippant tone of the cover advertising and the slightly trippy Victorian art, on one hand, and the traditional complex system and elaborate background, on the other.  The first, shouts "avant-garde" to the often very traditional gaming public, and the second, screams "traditional" to this avant-garde sub-culture.  <br/><br/>I hope that helps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BigJackBrass" title="BigJackBrass"><img alt="BigJackBrass" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/576/nNQFOT4MURTFT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BigJackBrass">BigJackBrass</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89169/#Comment_89169" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T12:15:14+00:00" title="August 21, 2007 12:15PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I heard about the game prior to its release and waited eagerly for it. Partly it was the premise of the game, partly the delightful cover blurb (which seems to have tickled my sense of humour but clearly not everyone's). As soon as it landed in the stores I bought a copy. And so far I haven't played it.<br/><br/>The D20 part really does present a problem for me. I don't see what it gives the game and it takes an awful lot of space in the book. Having worked through the rules (I'm not a D20 player, so there was no useful familiarity to the system for me) it seems perfectly fine, but no better than any other semi-generic system and I'm not terribly impressed by the range of results inherent in the mechanics. It seems <i>too</i> random and bland, and I suspect that unless that impression changes drastically when I play it then I'll likely port the whole thing over to <i>Fudge</i> and use it with <i>Terra Incognita.</i><br/><br/>Because the mechanics take up so much room there is not enough space devoted to the setting, which is where it really falls down for me. I can run a Victorian version of <i>Fringeworthy</i> with a Jasper Fforde twist without needing a new game for it, so I was hoping for more in <i>Passages,</i> more background and detail to spark my imagination and help me to construct more than just random <i>Sliders</i>-like adventures. It almost delivers, but I'd cheerfully lose half the pages devoted to the system in favour of more space for setting and such.<br/><br/>It's a fine little game in so many ways (and I'm aiming to run it before too long - especially now you've got the adventure on your site - and record the session for RPGMP3.com where some of our other games are linked as MP3 downloads) but it could have been quite brilliant. Maybe it's the feeling that it's <i>almost</i> what I was hoping for that makes it seem a bit flat.<br/><br/>That said I have recommended it, with caveats, to friends. It deserves a bit more attention.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BigJackBrass" title="BigJackBrass"><img alt="BigJackBrass" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/576/nNQFOT4MURTFT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BigJackBrass">BigJackBrass</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89170/#Comment_89170" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T12:15:47+00:00" title="August 21, 2007 12:15PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 21, 2007 12:20PM by BigJackBrass.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (server error caused duplicate post.

I hit the site, skimmed over the page and bailed.  The flavor sell copy on the page Justin linked to went on for far too long.  There's one basic tenet of website design about the fold -- don't make people scroll to get to the important content on your page.  The important content on the page is what the hell the game is about. Running at 1280x1024 pixels, the first bit of information about what Passages is about is one and a half screens down.  If I was in the market for a Victorianesque game and that page was the first thing I saw about the game, I'd think the actual book is written in the same manner: a ton of overwritten fluff that I have to get through until I reach the actual game.<br/><br/>Actually reading the bulleted list that's the selling point of the game, all five seem to indicate it's based on d20 and I've played enough d20 games to know the game system isn't for me.

The ad copy I've seen goes a long way to explain what the game <em>lets you do</em>, but I really don't need the game's permission to roleplay in Wonderland.  What I need to see from a book's ad copy is what it <em>does</em> that makes roleplaying Wonderland (or the Nautilus, or Baker Street) <em>easier for me</em>.  So let's start there: the game isn't telling me what it does.  Then I see:<br/>b) d20.  The d20 logo implies to me that what your game does is track hit points and handwave everything else into GM fiat.  Which is totally unfair, but nonetheless the exact impression I get whenever I pick up the book.<br/><br/>If the book did a better job of telling me what it offers, I wouldn't be relying on mere associations I have with a label.  But as it is, the label is all that I've got.<br/><br/>Out of curiosity, Justin, how many copies do you still have around?  There are solutions that you can use to clear out current stock, and then there are other solutions that you can use to make the next printing/edition more appealing.  Where are you on that spectrum?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89189/#Comment_89189" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T13:03:55+00:00" title="August 21, 2007  1:03PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Justin, will you be attending Dexcon, Dreamation, Ubercon, or I-Con? Or in NYC at any time? One of my players is Nick Logue who is a very popular author for Wizards and Paizo. If you run a demo or full game for him, and if he likes it, I can encourage him to write a short actual play report of your game on the various forums for Paizo, Wizards, and En World. That should help stir up sales among D20 customers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know you or how connected you are with other indie authors but I find the best way to get people into your game and talking about it is to include them in the development stage of your project and helping them out with their own games. This helps foster camaraderie and in such a small niche, camaraderie and word of mouth are huge!<br/>\n<br/>\nI also wanted to readdress price and page count. I didn't mean to bring it up originally to say that your game was too expensive. I think most RPGs should be much more expensive. My only point is that anything higher than $19-25 takes it out of the range as an impulse buy. And anything higher than $12 takes it out of range as a "sure, it doesn't look fully baked but there is enough there that I would give it a try." If it is more than $19-25, it just needs to have more behind it. And I believe perceived value is more important than page count. A higher page count can actually hurt you. It may mean more rules I have to learn, or more I have to do before I can start having fun. And a larger book makes it harder to get buy in as a casual game from players. And if no one is talking about it, that means you will have to do all the work to get anyone to play, and on and on. It's tough. And I definitely recognize the chicken/egg dilemma. I just wanted to be clear the literal price is only a small part of the overall perception of the product.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, this may help with your website:<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9710a.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9710a.html</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89190/#Comment_89190" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T13:04:01+00:00" title="August 21, 2007  1:04PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 21, 2007 1:05PM by JDCorley.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, a story gamer who likes D20 - a lot - the logo is not a turnoff (nor do I believe even for a split second that you can't be "literary" in some way with D20), but I strongly suggest nailing down what Ron suggested, because Victoriana mashups have existed a long, long time, and that's what I thought I was looking at from reading the reviews, but a story-to-story jumping makes my Martian antennae perk up and go "hmm, wha?

I expect I'd be able to sell out of those by the time I'd be able to re-jigger the game anyway. I'd love to hear your thoughts.<br/><br/>I think the first thing to do is re-jigger the marketing instead of re-jiggering the game.  That landing page on your site should say why I should run <i>Passages</i> for a <i>League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</i>-like game.  More importantly, it should show that the system in <i>Passages</i> is perfect for that game.<br/><br/>One of the things I would do is change the "A single d20" on that page to "A single twenty-sided die".  That simple change wouldn't have had me initially think that <i>Passages</i> is simply a <i>d20 Past</i> setting book.  Joshua says that he thought the d20 logo implies the game is all about tracking of hit points.  Note that there's no d20 logo on that page -- using the notation "d20" automatically implies the d20 system.  Changing that to "twenty-sided die" wouldn't automatically turn away gamers like Joshua and myself who really don't like the d20 system.  It will keep Joshua and me reading your ad copy for a bit longer and we might hit the hook that turns us on to your game.  As it is, we hit that "d20" and leave.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89214/#Comment_89214" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T14:03:59+00:00" title="August 21, 2007  2:03PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Justin, <br/><br/>The stuff Ron said about entering stories instantly made me go "WHA????

Then he mentioned the d20 system, and I bought another game instead.<br/><br/>If you could tell me <i>how</i> the system supports the experience of travelling inside Victorian fiction, then I might still get the game. As it stands now, the d20 thing keeps me from even entertaining picking up the game.<br/><br/>If you do a "How To Play" guide, then I might buy it. I really don't know why RPG designers don't include this in every game they publish, you don't get a boardgame just talking about its theme, skipping how to actually play it.

My impression is that it's using the same rules as true20 (which is a good choice) but without actually saying as much due to Green Ronin's licensing terms (which is to say the rules are OGL, but the name true20 is not).  I definitely answered a few questions about it at the booth, and I had nice things to say about it, but once I got past the premise, I didn't have a _hook_ to suggest how it was going to make things more awesome for them, which was a little rough.<br/><br/>Now, I don't think that d20, especially true-20-style d20, is necessarily a bad choice - I think you could turn it to your needs.  But the fact that you need to spend so much time reinventing the wheel, so to speak definitely works against the cool parts.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tadk" title="tadk"><img alt="tadk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nAYGI7O6LI2LV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tadk">tadk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89267/#Comment_89267" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T16:58:13+00:00" title="August 21, 2007  4:58PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was the 3rd Indie game I bought<br/>\nGot it on IPR a few months ago<br/>\n<br/>\nI love the idea and how damage is done and the entire genre<br/>\nNow if I had people to game with who love Steampunk like stuff as I do                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89270/#Comment_89270" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T17:15:40+00:00" title="August 21, 2007  5:15PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Website: Takes too long to get to what the game is about.<br/><br/>This stuff is selling features  instead of benefits. \n<blockquote>Passages presents a new role-playing system that features:<br/><br/>A single d20 for resolution of all conflicts. <br/>Only two kinds of checks: attribute checks and skill checks. <br/>Combat and grappling as skills. <br/>Classless, point-based character creation. <br/>Degrees of success and failure based on "spread." </blockquote>\nYou should try selling on benefits instead of features.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89300/#Comment_89300" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T19:22:28+00:00" title="August 21, 2007  7:22PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Passages has sat on my bookshelf for a few months now.  I don't think I've actually sat down with it and read it for any serious length of time yet, but here's my data point: so far, I haven't heard why I should.  Sure, even with Ron's post about it, I haven't been told why I shouldn't just take what I've learned from this thread and run that idea with what's starting to feel like the GURPS of the indie world, Spirit of the Century.  So, the fact that I don't know how your book supports that idea is one element.<br/><br/>The second, and maybe bigger element, is this:  So, you hacked d20.  Maybe -- I'll assume definitely, but from the point of view of a skeptic, maybe -- you even have a decent implementation of d20.  Here's the problem: you're doing double-duty here.  (1) You're having to convince d20 players why your version of d20 is worth playing more than theirs is.  In a world full of d20 hacks and tweaks, you have to show why yours stands out and <em>is worth re-learning the system, since you have enough tweaks to kill their assumptions about how to play it.</em>  AEG pulled this off with Spycraft, and again with Spycraft 2.0.  What are you doing to pull this off?<br/><br/>(2) You're having to convince story gamers to <em>try a game with the mental baggage surrounding the term "d20"</em>.  You certainly aren't going to get their attention by telling us how it's mechanically not like WotC's d20.  You're going to have to sell them on how your game would work for, say, my play group without getting into the fact that it's a d20 implementation until, honestly, you have us sitting down at the table.<br/><br/>I play games like Don't Rest Your Head, Truth &amp; Justice/PDQ, Polaris or Agon because (a) the mechanics in those games work with me and (b) they generally try to do one or two things well (even PDQ, which is generic in setting, doesn't do everything equally).  The one or two things d20 does well do not interest me.  When you tell me it's a d20-based game, you'll have to start telling me right away what -- not how, but what -- it does well that differs from stock d20, and you'll need to do it in a way that simultaneously tells me that your game does what I want and make me <em>not</em> question why you bothered to use d20 at all.<br/><br/>Maybe I sound like a bit of a dick here, but you want bluntness.  You put yourself in a hard position by trying to make an "indie20" game.  Hell, I've been tempted to try a couple times, and I always come back to "and why am I using d20 if I'm deviating from it this greatly?"  Kudos for doing it and making a game people like.  I suspect you have something good there, but there's too much baggage around "d20" and lengthy game books to interest me without warming me up first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89307/#Comment_89307" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T19:33:05+00:00" title="August 21, 2007  7:33PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 21, 2007 7:36PM by Josh Roby.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Justin, I'd take a moment to list off all the things that the players do in a given game.  And I mean, like, the nittiest-grittiest bullshit involved.  <em>Calculate spread</em>.  <em>Spend Hero Points</em> (can't remember what they're called).  <em>Use Nemesis Relationship to boost die pool</em> or whatever.  Winnow out the generic ones that you can find in any other game.  With what's left, make a stacatto-rhythm beat-by-beat description of play.  Dump in a lot of color.  See if it looks like back cover copy.<br/><br/>If it's feasible, you might want to rearrange your subtitle. "Adventures penned by literary giants" is incredibly passive.  In the absence of a title that explicitly says what the players do in the game, reworking the subtitle to do so may help.  "Adventure in the World of Victorian Literature" is closer, but can be read as imperative (You there!  Go adventure in the world of blah blah blah) or as dull description (It's an adventure in the yeah yeah yeah).  Or you can really punch it up and make it subversive -- something like, "Write between the lines of Victorian Literature" or "Cross pens with literary giants" and so on.<br/><br/>That difficulty table is gold, as jenskot said.  Put that on your webpage.  Ditch the stuff that's like "two kinds of die rolls" -- to be perfectly frank, nobody really cares.  At best, you're saying "this product is less annoying than products with which you are familiar!"  Every line should explain why a person wants to get excited about the game.  Which means, go back through everything, and if it wouldn't get somebody excited about the game, rewrite it or ditch it.<br/><br/><em>Oh yeah, and:</em> remove all instances of d20.  Replace with twenty-sided die.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh" title="jdrakeh"><img alt="jdrakeh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/909/nZA3BEK4G6OHW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh">jdrakeh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89311/#Comment_89311" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T20:01:04+00:00" title="August 21, 2007  8:01PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First, I love Dawning Star and am looking to repurchase it soon, so it's not <i>you</i>. Second, I love Victoriana and period literature, so it's not the subject matter. Third, I like d20 for non-commital, action-oriented, gaming. And therein lies the problem. Passages seems like it has something to say. It seems like an incredibly cool concept with a deep undercurrent of philospohical badassitude. It seems like a horribly awkward marriage. d20 is really big on the G, which is ostensibly why the system is the juggernaut that it is. d20 fans love it because its heavy on the G and that's what they want out opf d20 games. By design, it has almost no N and very little S. IME, people who want deep concepts and messages, want N and S in spades but could give a rat's ass about G. Looking at the big picture I could have told you that a d20 game with a heavy concept would be a hard sell <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89320/#Comment_89320" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-21T20:47:03+00:00" title="August 21, 2007  8:47PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A bit of slightly counter-to-the-thread advice, if you are committed to your d20 variant, you should know that for those of us who don't consider that a bad thing, or who even consider it a good thing, it's not really a selling point, but it is something factual that you have to deal with.  Go ahead and put "uses a variant of the popular d20 system" (or whatever the legalities require), but don't worry too much about it if what's really making the game cool is the non-system content.  GURPS supplements don't say "Uses the GURPS system, a simple but highly extensible 3d6 blah blah blah blah"...it just puts GURPS on the cover and says it's required and that's that. This is because the attraction of a GURPS game is not the system.

There are several reasons why and to be honest most of them have been covered already, but the gist of it is that it's a numbers game:<br/><br/><div>Games published &gt; Games I've heard about &gt; Games I want &gt; Games I buy &gt; Games I read &gt; Games I play</div><br/><br/>Since there are so many games published, a lot fail at the first hurdle because I don't get to hear about them.  Passages passed that because it was on the front page of IPR and on Voice of the Revolution (or was it HGWT?).  So it got into Games I've heard about.<br/><br/>It didn't make it to Games I Want though.  This is for two reasons:<br/><br/>1) 300 pages.  I don't have time to read a 300 page book.  I don't really have time to read a 150 page book.  I still have stuff which I bought just after last years gencon which I haven't read properly yet.  If I had time to read a 300 page book, I'd read Wild Talents (which I own), Rune Stryders (Which I also own), Mage: The Awakening (Which I've owned since it was released but have never opened), Edge Of Midnight (Ditto), Earthdawn (OK, that's 950 pages, probably not a fair comparison), Reign (Which I don't own, but would buy if I thought there was any chance I'd read it), Unhallowed Metropolis and The Savage World of Solomon Kane first before I even looked at anything else.<br/><br/>2) d20.  There's no way to be tactful about this and you wanted blunt.  I never buy d20 products.  Going back to the earlier diagram, Games I've Heard Of is so much bigger than Games I Play that I need to make pretty ruthless decisions about what I'll buy and really don't have time to research every single thing on the market.  As a result, if a game is in any way even tangentially related to d20, it gets instantly dismissed with no further investigation.  This saves a lot of time.  Possibly I am missing out on some decent games, but I'm already missing out on tons because I simply don't have time to read them, so the loss of the two or three d20 books a year I might have liked is no loss.<br/><br/>It's worth noting that 1) is far less of a stumbling block that 2).  There are 300 page games which I'll buy.  There are no d20 games which I'll buy.  d20 is not a hard-sell, it's a no-sell.<br/><br/>Nothing you haven't heard already in this thread to be honest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr" title="Lxndr"><img alt="Lxndr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/803/nRIOJTW5OT0WE.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr">Lxndr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89417/#Comment_89417" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-22T07:49:27+00:00" title="August 22, 2007  7:49AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, OGL is just a license under which lots of things can be published, by this point under multiple systems of mechanics, not just the d20 mechanics.

High production values are, honestly, sometimes an explicit turn off, as they fuck with the {book price :: play experience} ratio without actually making the play experience any better. (what the hell is with the price inflation these past two years? this year, it was hard to find games UNDER $20; my reasonably-priced <b>Fastlane</b> at $12 now looks like a generous minnow swimming with voracious sharks). You are currently above that hard limit. <br/>* I was on a very strict budget this year, thanks to the whole surgery thing, which made me not even consider the above-$20 books.<br/>* GenCon was the first I'd heard anything of Passages more than its name.

Usually this also means it contains character creation and advancement rules, which are the main restriction of the d20 license.  That's just what it means to the majority of consumers these days.

The term "d20" covers a wealth of sins, e.g., the license, the system, the die itself. To be even more technical, the name of the license is the "d20 System License". "d20" is often (probably even most often) used to describe the system. So, it's not incorrect to refer to OGL Conan as a "d20 game" at all. And, for purposes of this thread, it highlights the pitfalls of marketing a game that uses the d20 system (even in a highly modified form like <i>Passages</i>). As some have pointed out, even referring to just the die as a "d20" carries alot of baggage to the end consumer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89426/#Comment_89426" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-22T08:20:58+00:00" title="August 22, 2007  8:20AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rich Stokes</cite>However, there is a tacit understanding that a book marketed/described as "OGL" is actually a d20 book without the trade mark.</blockquote>\nAnd that's one of the reasons, I guess, SotC is not marketed or described as such.

And True 20.  Which is smart.<br/><br/>I read it here:<br/><br/><a href="http://greenronin.com/2006/03/the_future_of_freeport.php" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://greenronin.com/2006/03/the_future_of_freeport.php</a>\n<blockquote>Moving into 2006 we had a problem though. Well, several problems really. First, Freeport: City of Adventure was sold out and had been for quite some time. Nor could we do a simple reprint because the original was written for the D&amp;D 3.0 rules and since its publication the 3.5 edition had been released. To complicate matters further, all d20 publishers from WotC on down had been watching their d20 sales degrade after 3.5 came out. It would thus have been a risk to do a 3.5 revision of Freeport: City of Adventure. Doubly so, with 4th edition clearly on the horizon. We had already watched our 3.0 backstock rendered obsolete when 3.5 came out, so we didn't want to do a new marquee product tied to 3.5 only to see the same thing happened when 4th edition was announced.</blockquote>\nThis was 18 months ago.

By way of trivia, I should mention to the others that I had submitted Passages for the True20 setting search. It would have been interesting to see what would have happened had that come to fruition. Also, I had always intended to distill the system in Passages further to a barely recognizeable distant mutant cousin of d20. Originally, I was calling it Bullseye 20, but changed it just to Bullseye to further distance it from d20 (the ad in Passages uses Bullseye 20).<br/><br/>Sophie, one of the things I was always planning on doing was a series of free pdfs with literary characters and related adventure seeds, etc. I'm thinking about doing another series with descriptions of new literary worlds. I'm hoping that I can fill out the setting that way without repurposing the entire product.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90371/#Comment_90371" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-25T09:35:42+00:00" title="August 25, 2007  9:35AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Anemone</cite><cite>Posted By: Pramas</cite>And I became really enamoured of the whole systemless setting book idea too. There are many fantasy games that don't have a lot of campaign settings to choose from. Why not do a book that could appeal to GMs of them all?</blockquote>\nThis might even take us back to the OP a little, since in truth I'd be more interested in a system-less (or multi-system)<i>Passages</i>than in a d20 one. I picture chapters on staples of the genre and the era, how to create literary Victorian adventures, adventure seeds, etc. Justin, is that something that would have any interest at all for you?<br/><br/>By the way, Chris, the system-less approach is definitely working on me: I've already decided I must have the<i>Pirate's Guide to Freeport</i>, and I doubt I would have if it had been straight d20 material (though I<i>might</i>have picked up a True20 one.)<br/><br/>I actually skipped TW because it was d20, and went and tracked down the old Chaosium TW stuff on E-bay instead. I would have totally gone for a non-system TW book by preference.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90733/#Comment_90733" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T12:34:58+00:00" title="August 27, 2007 12:34PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Isn't Passages the game that has "Asian" as a character class?

That never would've occurred to me--so I can see how it might not've occurred to Justin. I mean, it's perfectly good English, using normal English words (well, ok, i had to suss out "scrofulous" from context), spelled properly. Compared to reading internet-ese, not to mention text messaging, it's positively crystal clear.<br/><br/>And I found it entertainingly out-of-context. And the intent perfectly clear, because i've seen a fair number of turn-of-the-century ads, mostly for "patent medicines". One of the coolest things ever was when i was interviewing an elderly man in an assisted living facility when i was in middle school (so, more than 20 years ago) and he had a Sears &amp; Roebuck catalog from when he was a kid, which meant right around the turn of the century, IIRC. Those of you who just didn't get this part of the ad text, have you simply never seen the originals that this is spoofing? Or did you think that the spoof didn't come across, or didn't do anything to advertise the game?<br/><br/>I <i>do</i> agree that this is a poor first introduction to the game on the website. It works great, IMHO, as the back-cover copy, but either needs to be much shorter, or come *after* some actual text about the game. Go with what others have said: shorten it so the "real" info begins within the first screenful. Or change the layout so there's a sidebar with descriptive info that starts right near the top, alongside the flavor text.\n<blockquote>- Who is Robert Louis Stevenson, Professor Gibberne, Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, and Jules Gabriel Verne?

When the others say it's about things they aren't interested in, it's because they're only seeing things, and not thematic purpose.</blockquote>\nAs someone who's read, but not played, Passages, i think that's the real issue: it's *not* a Narrativist game. At least, i don't see any evidence that it is. The mechanics are all about what the character can do, not why they do it, and in a semi-Simulationist (if not detailed/realistic) model. I'd say that Passages is a perfect example of Threefold Dramatism--which means it really isn't any of G, N, or S.\n<blockquote>4) d20: This one is a very sticky issue. I think one of the problems with the game is that it stands between both "worlds", i.e., d20 and story-games. It's really a d20-story-game, i.e., both. I think some of what is happening (and seems to be borne out by some of the comments in this thread) is that the d20 folks think it's "too indie" and the S-G folks don't want to invest much time in an interation of d20. Thoughts on how I can show that the game can be satisfying to both? Is that even possible?<br/><br/>Note: Sadly, Fae Noir (which I know isn't your game) suffers from the same problem despite my love, love, LOVE for the concept. Fae Noir is my greatest disappointment this year.</blockquote>\nAside: I, too, passed on Fae Noir when i found out that it was mechanically nothing special, and, more importantly, that the setting wasn't super-detailed. I'm perfectly willing to buy setting-heavy, boring-mechanics games, but not when the setting is more like broad strokes, thus not really saving me all that much work. (n.b.: i didn't look really closely at Fae Noir. I got far enough to determine that the system was, at best, not bad, and that the raw pagecount of setting info was too small for the price, for me. So there could actually be a lot of very cool twists/details on the setting in there that i missed, though conversation about it seems to support my impression.) But i bought Passages, knowing what i was getting, and am pleased with it.<br/><br/>So, Justin: why haven't more folks who frequent Story Games bought Passages? I think it's because they're not the target market. Now, why haven't folks who like traditional RPGs bought it? That's less obvious to me. I bought it because i love the premise, and am often perfectly happy with traditional mechanics mated to a detailed setting (as opposed to tools for creating a setting, and addressing theme, and so on).<br/><br/>I think the problem is that Passages stands not "between worlds", but in a space that has been defined out of existence. That is, yes, it's trying to address literary structures, but it has no interest in literary themes, and it, for the most part, addresses literature through channels other than the mechanics. With the possible exception of Universalis, all the "story games" i'm aware of are essentially equal parts Narrativist and Gamist in structure. Specifically, they insist that theme must be addressed, and that theme must be addressed via the mechanics. So, even if your game is designed to address theme, if the mechanics of the game don't do that addressing, most folks won't recognize it as Narrativist. And, like I said, unless i missed it, i don't think Passages is intended to address theme in the Narrativist sense, in the first place. <br/><br/>Your own words in this thread reinforce that impression for me: Passages is about experiencing/exploring a cool setting. And there's nothing wrong with that. It's OK to have an RPG, even an indie RPG, that isn't Narrativist. But it does mean that JDCorley is probably right: the selling point of Passages isn't the system. So quit trying to sell it on the system, because really all that you've said about the system is what it isn't--which, unfortunately, boils down to "the system doesn't suck", which isn't exactly gonna drive sales. So, like he said, quit talking about the system: those who want the mechanics to be all innovative won't be sold no matter what you say, because they aren't; and those who want traditional D20 System don't need to be told the niggling details of how it differs--it's close enough, i'd think.\n<blockquote>For myself, it's this:\n<blockquote><cite>Passages</cite>But Passages is so much more than just a new rpg system, it's a fully realized literary campaign setting of the Victorian era. Take the helm of the Nautilus! Cross swords with the Scarlet Pimpernel! Match wits with the devious Professor Moriarty! Anything is possible in the world of Passages.</blockquote>\n"You can do anything!" is rather a red flag for me. My experience with such claims tells me to expect the whole damn thing to collapse into genre incoherence. It suggests a setting collage and players expressing diverse characters without telling me how the game works to achieve thematic coherence.</blockquote>\nInstead, talk more about the setting, and what the characters do. And, unless i misread, or am now misremembering, it's not intended to be about literally entering fictional works that exist within the game setting, a la <i>The Eyre Affair</i>, is it? The basic premise is that those fictional works aren't fictional--they're descriptions of real people, places, and happenings, though perhaps embellished, and the PCs can meet/visit/discover the actual things that are behind the stories. So, if someone kills Captain Nemo, that doesn't change existing copies of Verne's story all across the world--though it might lead to a sequel. <br/><br/>If I got that correct, you need to clear that up, because too many people are getting the impression that it's a meta-fictional setup like Fforde's works, and will be disappointed when it turns out the game isn't. Or did i miss a metaphysical connection that causes changes in the real events to have greater ramifications than i'm describing? Also, I agree that emphasizing the coolness of Phineas Fogg slaying the Jabberwock, or Queequegg and the Caterpillar sharing a hookah, or whatever, is great. Maybe as a sum-up description you should be saying something like "meet the real people that inspired the greatest Victorian literature", to emphasize that it's not about the texts themselves, it's about the parallel worlds that inspired the texts?\n<blockquote>I am going back to the drawing board armed with a lot of great insight. And I've got something of a new tagline I'm toying with that gets the concept across a little better: "There are twenty faces on the die. Each one tells a story."</blockquote>\nOnly one problem i see with that: it's evocative, but not descriptive. That is, since the actual resolution system is a simple linear comparison, looking at differences and giving broad degrees of success (which come in 5-pt increments, IIRC), a given die roll only gives you something like 4 different "stories", in the sense of different results for a given roll. If i read that tagline, i'd be expecting something with the degree of variance of results of, say, the Everway Fortune Deck--that is, distinct qualities of results, not just a range of quantities within the same quality. And i'd be disappointed when i then read the mechanics and found pretty much bog-standard True20. Whereas, i knew what i was getting with Passages, as is, and thus had appropriate expectations (to whit: the mechanics won't impress me, but will give a basic structure and mostly stay out of the way; the cool bits will be elsewhere).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stevebarkeruk" title="stevebarkeruk"><img alt="stevebarkeruk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.collective-endeavour.com/files/pictures/picture-239.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stevebarkeruk">stevebarkeruk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90886/#Comment_90886" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T05:30:34+00:00" title="August 28, 2007  5:30AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I did find it hard to read, yes, because although <i>"uninjurious to the digestion because of the slow measured absorption of rules and use of a singular icosahedron for resolution."</i> might be perfectly good English, it is so far removed from modern usage that it makes you work to understand what it is actually saying.

SotC is OGL [and not D20 System].<br/><br/>Umm.. No. Not the way WotC uses the terms, which is what Im going by for the purpose of this discussion.<br/><br/>WotC uses the terms? I've never seen it. That is, I've seen them talk about "D20 System games" all the time--but i've never seen them use "OGL" as a label for a category of game, period. And in the process of not wanting to promote/advertise the similarity between and compatibility with non-D20STL-using RPGs, they've rarely or never, that i've seen, made a distinction between D20 System games that use the license and those that don't, because that would require talking about the perfectly-compatible competitor games that don't use the D20STL, and thus drawing attention to them. The useage you're referring to grew out of producers of D20 System games other than WotC, and useage on various discussion forums (i suspect, but don't know, driven by that useage on the D20STL and WotC OGL lists--i'm pretty sure i saw it there well before i saw it on more general forums), and was cemented by Mongoose's very frustrating decision to co-opt the term and use it as a system label. And if you're going to fall back on WotC useage, it's definitely "D20 System", not "d20".\n<blockquote>Its not d20 unless it carries the d20 label, you know, the logo thingy? Its OGL if it has d20 mechanics but doesnt have the logo.<br/><br/>SOtC uses a variation of the open gaming license, but its not "OGL." Only products which use the WotC d20 Open Gaming License are "OGL."</blockquote>\nOK, using that terminology, what <i>is</i> the label for something that uses the OGL, and yet isn't D20 System?<br/><br/>And the D20 System Trademark License is just that--it's a restriction on using a very specific label in the context of trade. I see nothing useful in the consumers differentiating between D20 System games that have the D20 System logo, and D20 System games that don't--Spycraft has the logo, Arcana Unearthed doesn't. You telling me that the former is in any meaningful way more similar to or compatible with D&amp;D than the latter is? <br/><br/>Look, it's not my fault that WotC chose a stupidly-generic trademark that can be trivially circumvented or confused. I'm not about to confuse conversations by abiding by a restriction that only applies to a very narrow circumstance (commercial trade), especially not one that is relatively meaningless when discussing the contents of the games. There is perfectly good terminology for distinguishing those D20 System games that use the D20STL, and those that don't: "D20STL" or "D20 System-logoed" or "D20-logoed" (if you insist). Leaving "D20 System" to describe games that use, you know, the D20 System. Otherwise, we end up in the linguistic trap of having co-opted the obvious term to describe games that simply use the WotC OGL, and having no useful way to distinguish between those games that are D20 System[-derived] and those that use some other system. I'm just arguing for natural labelling: released under the OGL=="OGL"; uses D20 System=="D20 System"; uses the D20STL (when it's necessary/useful to distinguish from the previous category, which is generally only in the context of licensing and trademarks)=="D20STL". <br/><br/>And this isn't just me being pedantic--it arises out of some lengthy miscommunications i've observed on various online fora, due very precisely to some people trying to discuss OGL games while others misread it as being about D20 System games that don't carry the D20 System Logo. (Or, less often, due to someone trying to discuss D20 System games while others misread it as being solely about those D20 System games that carry the D20 System logo.)<br/><br/>In terms of it being germaine to Justin's situation, i'll point out that, despite not carrying the logo, everyone who's commented on the system in this thread has referred to it as "d20", "d20 system", or "tweaked d20 system" or something similar. That's the system, and no amount of trademark handwaving is going to fool those who dislike D20 System, or those who like it. [Though the lack of the trademark might be causing some people who prefer D20 System and are less well versed in RPGs to not look at it.]<br/><br/>----\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>woodelf, are you purposely trying to be a dick?

Growing up, it's wasn't an issue of literary interests. When we are spending time trying to figure out where we are going to sleep the next day or take a shower or my dad is starving because he would rather my sister's eat than eat himself, or my mom is crying because she wants me to give her the $5 I was just given as a birthday present... I'm not too concerned with literary anything. <br/><br/>It's a sore subject because I and others I knew growing up constantly had to drop out of school to help support their families. My mom worked 3 jobs. I dropped out of college for a while to support my family. Honestly, it was a privilege to go to college. I scored in the top 98% in all the English and Math NY city and state elementary + high school standardized tests I've ever taken. And in high school I spoke 4 languages. Growing up my family constantly had people of higher economic status look down on them. Growing up, I was constantly sneered for not having read X book, or watched Y show, or listened to Z song. I'm not kidding when I say I don't recognize certain key literary authors. It's not a measure of intelligence or worth. But I still get people freak out when I tell them I didn't grow up with a TV. That's a privilege. And not one that everyone has. <br/><br/>That all being said, I should not have blown up on woodelf that way. I could have made my points without resorting to an outpouring of unrestrained emotion. <a href="http://news.google.com/news?q=greece+burning" rel="nofollow">It's been a tough few days and the issues of poverty and privilege are heavy on my mind with hundreds of my family members losing their homes in Greece.</a> And woodelf was good enough to apologize even though he didn't have to and his last post was very respectful.

More to the point, the chargen section notes that class and ethnicity were important issues during that time. It gives descriptions of the various social classes (intentionally inaccurately called "castes" to distinguish from the rpg mechanic) and ethnicities (or, more accurately, ethnicity groups) and suggests that selecting a class and ethnicity is an important part of describing your character. As a suggestion, players may select a +1 bonus to a skill for their caste and ethnicity. They get to pick which skill and tell why their caste or ethnicity yields the bonus. For example, someone playing an Asian character could give themselves a +1 bonus to their Grapple skill and say that they received rudimentary training in one of the martial arts; or they could take a +1 bonus to Craft Origami; etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

Here's what I'm thinking:<br/><br/>As a person who wants to be progressive and inclusive regarding issues of race, sex, religion, etc:<br/><br/>- "Asian" as a homogeneous ethnic group is ridiculous and meaningless at best or a thinly veiled stereotype at worst. But I wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt! I'm not the knee-jerk PC type. So I asked for an explanation.<br/><br/>- Then you say an "Asian" PC might be good at Martial Arts and Origami, which is sooooo stereotyped, cliche, and borderline racist that I'm just plain shocked. Should "Africans" (ha) be good at Throwing Spears and Voodoo? I realize that the player gets to pick their bonuses, but the fact that your example is that wrong-headed makes me wonder what other artifacts are lurking in your text.<br/><br/>- I certainly don't think you're a racist, Justin, just to be clear. But your example of what "Asians" might be good at is <i>embarrassing</i>. The idea that "Asians" ought to get some kind of "racial bonus" <i>because they're Asian</i> makes me very sad. I think it's good to seriously think about the essentializing and exotifying of various peoples as presented in fiction and games, and whether that stuff should be continued, regardless of how "genre appropriate" it is.<br/><br/>As a game designer:<br/><br/>- Craft Origami? WTF? Is that actually a skill in the game? Do you have paper-folding conflicts? Of course you don't. But you do have the d20 system logic of making any given activity a mechanical skill, regardless of its relevance in play.

I wasn't paying attention to detail in my prior post, and I'm sure that exacerbated the misconception. As for how it's actually present in the book, Nat and Joshua have it just right. From the book:\n<blockquote>The Victorian era was a time of great change around the globe. Amazing things were happening in every culture; international travel was becoming more commonplace. It was, paradoxically, a time of both rising jingoism and the free exchange of ideas. To encourage a sociall diverse game experience which reflects this phenomenon, Passages players select a culture for their characters at creation.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>The major cultures in the nineteenth century world of Passages are Arab, Asian, easterner, Frontiersman, Native, and Westerner. The descriptions below are not meant to suggest that all such individuals come from the same country, share the same language, hold simila rreligious belief, and so forth. However, they can serve as a good starting point to flesh out a character.</blockquote>\nThe mechanical benefits of culture are presented as an optional rule in one of the Moriarty sidebars:\n<blockquote>The Narrator can allow mechanical distinctions among the cultures. For this variant, each player assigns a +1 bonus to a skill or a +2 bonus to a sub-skill and explains how his character's culture ties in to the bonus. For example, Charles might decide that Oliver's London upbringing [Westerner culture] exposed him to the bustling streets of a civilized metropolis; he gives Oliver a +2 bonus on Carouse (Gather Information) checks.</blockquote>\nThis same treatment is given to social castes as well. In my example above (Grappling vs. Origami), I was just trying to pick to diametrically opposed types of skills to show the potential variety in using the rule. You can pick whatever skill you want to give the bonus to: a Nepalese with a bonus to Survival, etc. The point is that you get to decide. It seems to me that you were operating from a pretty gross misconception of the actual game text (admittedly exacerbated by my quick reply). If you still have a problem with (and your Nemo comment above makes me think you do), I'd be interested to take that issue to another thread. In fact, I'm happy to shoot you a pdf so you can review the material in full context. As it stands right now, I'm getting the same feeling you'd probably be getting if someone said: "Agon, isn't that the game where, if you want to play a woman, you have to be some ostracized Amazon freak?"<br/><br/>As to the game design point, Craft is a skill generally, and the player decides what specific area they want to specialize in, e.g., origami, blacksmithing, haberdashery (essentially the same as the D&amp;D skill of the same name). I'll have to disagree with you on your reaction on this point. As JD says, skills are the functional equivalent of kickers. If I'm the Narrator and one of the PCs has Craft Origami, he's telling me that he wants stories that include origami. Yes, I will find a way to make it relevant, e.g., the calling card of Jack the Ripper is a folded swan, wrestling with the Queen of Hearts's playing-card minions in Wonderland, folding Blackbeard's treasure map the proper way so it can be read, etc.<br/><br/>And, yes, I <i>am</i> lovely and thoughtful. Or so my wife keeps telling me. ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91304/#Comment_91304" name="Item_126" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-29T08:48:55+00:00" title="August 29, 2007  8:48AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2007 8:57AM by Rich Stokes.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Justin D.

As I said, I wasn't attempting to critique your game book, but rather give an honest reaction to what I had heard about it secondhand and from your comments here. The text you quoted from the book makes me feel better about how the issue is handled in the actual game. Not that my feelings are the issue here, of course. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I still think that the super-broad cultural groups are not the best idea in the world, but that's not such a major issue.<br/><br/>From the game design standpoint, I understand where you're coming from, and the skill-flag technique you describe is one that I have used many times in the past in my own play of d20 and loads of other traditional games. I don't find that technique to be especially satisfactory, given much more effective alternatives (IMO). If it works for you, that's great, but I have put in my time playing that way and am not interested in going back to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91344/#Comment_91344" name="Item_128" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-29T10:55:01+00:00" title="August 29, 2007 10:55AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Justin,<br/><br/>I don't know if you're still looking for data, and I don't have much additional to add really, but here I go vomiting my opinions anyway.<br/><br/>I was drawn immediately by the Jennifer Rodgers cover and by the figures on it.

The literary tropes found in Victorian writing do tend to blur distinctions when dealing with various cultures. Since you are going for that feel, I'm guessing your game understandably mirrors some of the conventions of the period in this regard.

Over at OBS, Passages sold 23 pdfs in the first month, putting it on par with Fred's DRYH -- pretty good company I'd say. 66 copies overall in the first 7 months--not bad, but not great. Interestingly, I got a very nice bump after Gen Con this year. So, yes, I do think I get some rising-tide effect in the "mainstream" rpg community from Dawning Star and, by extension, Poisoncraft. I think this is particularly true with the reviews. For example, Chris "Crothian" Gath is one of the staff reviewers, and he's from EN World and firmly entrenched in the d20 milieu (though he reviews non-trad stuff as well from time to time).<br/><br/>This, of course, was my original premise. I think the game stands "between both worlds"--not fully welcome in either. I think that much of the commentary in this thread bears out the truth of that premise from the S-G side of things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101268/#Comment_101268" name="Item_133" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-05T09:51:28+00:00" title="October  5, 2007  9:51AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I originally bought the PDF and I have been impressed  enough with our playtests to buy the soft cover printing.

The only thing I would love to see more out of these games is scalability of the mechanics so that when all my story game buddys are around we scale back and describe more and when my DnD buddys are in on the game we can scale the resolution up a bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101289/#Comment_101289" name="Item_134" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-05T11:13:41+00:00" title="October  5, 2007 11:13AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Justin, I was happy to see this thread as Passages is one of those games that I've heard about, but haven't felt compelled to purchase or research. I'll throw in with all the people that have said Jennifer's art is a big selling point (I have the prints for Jabberwocky and The Invasion hanging on my wall, which is ironic eh?) but the big thing that has kept me as a distant "meh" is that I haven't heard a hook. I'm not saying there aren't any, I just haven't heard one. Like, DitV I hear "Raising stakes and town creation!" and for Polaris I hear "Key phrases!" I haven't read all of the other posts to this thread so maybe potential hooks have gotten mentioned, but I think you need to dig one out of the book and hammer-hammer-hammer on it. If I hear Passages I want to hear a hook shortly after.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

Sweet!<br/><br/>My prior position hasn't changed in that I've digested alot of great material from this thread and am in the process of rebooting my marketing effort from the website on down.<br/><br/>To answer your specific question, Bret, my personal opinion about the hook for Passages is spread. The difference between the result of a check and the opposing number (be it a target number or an oppsed roll) is the spread. The spread <i>informs</i> the narrative. The greater the spread, the more spectacular the success or failure. It doesn't sound like much, but it has a dramatic impact on play. Think about when you're playing D&amp;D and, say, the thief is trying to pick the lock on the treasure chest. In D&amp;D, his roll is high enough, the DM says: "OK, you open the lock" or some such. If the roll fails, the DM says: "You are unable to open the lock." When we add spread to the mix, it subliminally <i>forces</i> the participants to flesh out the narrative with greater detail. So, Topper Baines, Gentleman Thief, sets at the lock to Dr. Jekyll's steamer. The player succeeds but the spread is only 1 or 2; this cues the participants that success was tip-of-the-fingers close. The Narrator says: "Your pick catches, seems to jam for a moment, before the final pin slides back into place." If the spread is, say, 15, the Narrator says: "Before the others can turn their gaze to see your work, the lock falls open without so much as a whisper of a protest from the metal." Or, indeed, I encourage the player to narrate great successes (as I'll be noting in my upcoming Narrator's Companion).<br/><br/>Or, as I'm presently toying with as a tagline: "The die has 20 faces--each one tells a story."<br/><br/>I also hear people liking the plot point system. It doesn't seem like much to this crowd, but for d20 diehards, it's a real eye-opener.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101334/#Comment_101334" name="Item_136" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-05T14:14:34+00:00" title="October  5, 2007  2:14PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a great catchphrase!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101342/#Comment_101342" name="Item_137" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-05T15:08:13+00:00" title="October  5, 2007  3:08PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like it, too.

I love the back blurb and the fake quotes, I knew where you were coming from right away.<br/><br/>A very similar design of text is used for advertising GURPS Goblins, which is aiming at another bit of the same world (its the literary view of the gutter though) and it works just fine there.<br/><br/>I would just take the back cover text, change the font to something suitable for a victorian handbill and put it on a graphic background, box it out to the right and put a more normal description of the game in the center spot. That way you keep the funny text, but clearly marked out as a victorian style advert, *and* provide some more sensible text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3982/ill-be-blunt-why-do-you-have-no-interest-in-passages/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3982/ill-be-blunt-why-do-you-have-no-interest-in-passages">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3982/ill-be-blunt-why-do-you-have-no-interest-in-passages/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3982/ill-be-blunt-why-do-you-have-no-interest-in-passages/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F3982%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F3982%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
