The basic gist is that you get dice when following them, and lose dice when avoiding them. If you have slightly conflicting Passions, then the dice cancel out. Mostly.</blockquote>\nI know that Reign isn't really supposed to be about dealing with internal emotional conflict, so this isn't really a fair complaint but it seems like a bit of a cop-out that when the things that you care most about come into conflict they just cancel out and that's it. And then, being a big geek, I realized that a game that would avoid this problem would be Hegelian, in a good way if such a thing is possible.<br/><br/>A very simplified explanation of Hegel/Fitche's dialectic (because I sure as hell don't understand the nuances):<br/><br/>Thesis: Basic idea.<br/>Anti-Thesis: Something that reacts to the thesis, often some kind of contradiction within the original thesis, not some outside polar opposite.<br/>Synthesis: How the contradiction between thesis and anti-thesis is resolved and then you get a new anti-thesis for the synthesis and things keep on developing.<br/><br/>Example<br/><br/>Thesis: Being<br/>Anti-thesis: Non-being<br/>Synthesis: Becoming<br/>New Anti-thesis: Ending<br/>New Synthesis: Life Cycle<br/><br/>Or something like that.<br/><br/>How the hell does this apply to RPGs?<br/><br/>Well in most RPGs there's conflict, lots and lots and conflict. Most of the conflict is external conflict, and such conflict is generally zero or negative-sum with a loser and a victor (Phyrric or otherwise). Internal/emotional conflict is generally modeling by having the PC be yanked one way or another on a spectrum between two extremes (very zero sum) or has no mechanical effect at all (like in the example from the Reign review above). Basically either one thing kills another thing and takes its stuff or there's a stalemate, not very dynamic.<br/><br/>This isn't a very Hegelian way of looking at conflict. Conflict isn't a tug of war and it doesn't result in a clear-cut winner of loser. Often conflict results in a way of ending the conflict that wasn't anyone's goal to begin with. For example the victor of the religious wars of the 1600's in Europe wasn't Catholicism or Protestantism, it was Secularism.<br/><br/>How would this play out in an RPGs:<br/><br/>1. Internal emotional turmoil and internal contradictions in general would be mechanically important.<br/>2. When a character gets hit with a Bang that makes him choose which between several conflicting values, the sort of action that makes the most sense on his part wouldn't be choosing which value to value more but how to make those values less conflicting.<br/>3. When conflict erupts, the end result would often be a compromise that neither side was expecting or seeking.<br/>4. Change in personality mechanics wouldn't be a tug of war between two extremes but the way that players would change after dealing with contradictions between their desires vs. beliefs, beliefs vs. reality, goals vs. beliefs, etc. etc.<br/>5. A system with mechanics based around dealing with and resolving contradictions of various sorts would be an awesome Bang-generating machine.<br/><br/>I don't have much of a clue about how to implement this (got some random ideas floating around in my head, but nothing concrete yet) but I think it would be a cool way to re-think how RPG approach conflict, both external and internal. I'm trying to think of a game that already does this and the only thing that's coming up is Unknown Armies/Nemesis' sanity trackers and the way that sanity and hardness interact...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110190/#Comment_110190" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-28T22:00:43+00:00" title="November 28, 2007 10:00PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dig games that do impliment this sort of complex change (if I am reading this right).

Didn't think of DoW when I was writing up my post but the compromise mechanic fits perfectly.<br/><br/>Now what I really want is what if your character has "Loves the Princess" and "Greedy" as BITs/Aspect/Keys/whatever, that when they come into conflict you could end up with something like "Wants to mooch off the Princess for money" on your character sheet and have there be a set of mechanics that could produce that kind of result.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110199/#Comment_110199" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T00:32:49+00:00" title="November 29, 2007 12:32AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Daztur</cite>I don't have much of a clue about how to implement this (</blockquote>\nDoes this work as a thought experiment?<br/><br/>Belief 1: Killings is always wrong (1d10)<br/>Belief 2: I must protect my mother (1d10)<br/><br/>Situation: Pirates attack my mother.<br/>Conflict: Do I kill the pirates to protect my mother, or do I refrain from killing the pirates at the risk of my mother's death?<br/><br/>Possible resolution: I kill the pirates<br/><br/>Synthesis:<br/>Belief 1: Killing is usually wrong (1d8) (because I have now killed for a just cause)<br/>Belief 2: I should protect my mother (1d8) (because protecting things can lead to trouble)<br/>Belief 3: Killing to protect my mother is justified (1d10)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110238/#Comment_110238" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T06:57:25+00:00" title="November 29, 2007  6:57AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 29, 2007 7:43AM by Andy.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, ok: I was walking into this thread ready to throw a hand grenade, expecting Zeitgeist and all sorts of bubbly German pre-Marx nonsense, but the Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis stuff (focusing on that one aspect of Hegel's grand theory) is pretty cool.
