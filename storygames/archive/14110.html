The ideas in this article have really resonated with me in respects to gaming, creating and even work, and I would love to know what others think.  It talks about improv, but I agree that it pertains to any gaming.<br/><br/>1. "Practice until it's intuitive."  I have to tell my kids this every day.  Practice, practice, practice.  I guess the only way to practice gaming is to game.  Are there other ways to practice?  Maybe writing?  <br/><br/>2. "Listen."  YES!  "While others are talking there\u2019s a tendency to be thinking of what you might say next. Resist this urge. Try not to respond until others have finished."  Such a simple idea, but powerful.  I'm not good at this.  I'm always worried about what I say and making sure I have something to say that I miss what others are saying.  <br/><br/>3.  "Try not to repeat yourself."  I often come up with a good idea and just keep on it.  Trying to break out of that is not easy.<br/><br/>4.  "Spur others into action."  Great example in the article.  I love the idea of really listening to what others are doing and modify the play to fit that.<br/><br/>5.  "Fail admirably."  Don't worry about sounding stupid, learn by failing.<br/><br/>In the introduction it talks about each artists unique skills.  How do you use that at the table to play?  If one girl is great with describing places, do you give her that as her job.  If a guy comes up with fantastic names for characters, do you let him take that role?<br/><br/>Any thoughts about applying these ideas to gaming or how to break out of your rut to embrace these?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319511/#Comment_319511" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-07T23:22:18+00:00" title="April  7, 2011 11:22PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            3. and 4. describe an aim but not a method.

I'm very interested on what people think about my take of a fusion of elements 1., 2., and 4. that I'm thinking of...<br/>\n<br/>\nJazz is a VERY harmonic form of music, and consequently, it is the harmony that drives the improviser's melody.  I feel that in gaming, this is semantically embodied in the idea of "collective storytelling;" if there is no harmony within the group (however dissonant that harmony may be) the story falls apart.  Likewise, I feel like we can also think of harmony (through the jazz lens) as a form - the "rules" of the song, or in our case, of the game.  We need a basic harmonic form to work with - a box of our own definition to work inside.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn jazz, when we first learn to improvise, we learn "patterns:" musical ideas that fit into specific harmonies.  While you learn the patterns (by practicing them until they are second nature), you also must listen to understand how they work within the context of the harmonic form.  Only when you have mastered patterns and listening can you really break off into something really wild!  And, herein lies the beauty.  If we have set patterns within our rules that we follow, but if we also listen for opportunities to deviate from that pattern, we gamers can create countless ideas that fall within the context of the form, but never came to mind until the spontaneity of the moment drove us in that direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, this is just the musings of a jazzman who openly wants to be a game designer!  I hope they are helpful, however, because it really is quite a fascinating topic.<br/>\n<br/>\n(p.s. As a disclaimer, I know next to NOTHING about RPG theory, or what-have-you, but through the musical lens, maybe I do now!!!).  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Klaus                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319658/#Comment_319658" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-08T12:05:35+00:00" title="April  8, 2011 12:05PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Erik_Battle</cite>3.

I read the description at the original link, and it sounds like what they mean is "don't be afraid to try new things", and "try not to shoehorn one idea you like into all kinds of different contexts".<br/><br/>Good advice. But repetition, by itself, is a big part of any improvising musician's palette.<br/><br/>I think the equivalent of the harmony and form of, say, a jazz standard, is evident in game design via the structure of a game session (the entire performance), scene structure (a "chorus", in jazz terms), and conflict resolution cycles (harmonic rhythm, dissonance and resolution, functions just as conflict and resolution in stories or games).<br/><br/>I think there are many interesting parallels, although there are also many significant differences (stories and music are very different forms!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
