As in recent years, it will be held at our home, just inside the 270 loop on the north side of Columbus. If you coming to Origins, if you want an afternoon and evening of off-site socializing, and if you can find us, maybe you can hire... The A-Team. Erm, that is, maybe you should join us!<br/><br/>As in past years, we will be providing grilled meat and related products. We will also have vegetarian-friendly salads of various descriptions. Non-alcoholic drinks will be provided, but if you want something with more kick, you are encouraged to bring it.<br/><br/>Naturally, gaming of various flavours is desired and encouraged!  Our own collection of titles will be available, but you are welcome to bring your new discoveries from the con and old favorites to share with others.<br/><br/>This year we are also adding a "Free Game Trade Area".  Magenta and I have managed to amass a number of games that either don't float our collective boat, we haven't played in a while and are unlikely to play again, and/or<br/>both.  In addition, I have a handful of gaming tomes that I have multiple copies of (largely due to having written for them) and that seem unlikely to fly off my personal shelves any time soon.  Sure, we could try to [insert your favorite on-line auction site here] them or sell them to [insert your favorite local gaming re-sale shop here], but it seemed they would be more likely to get a good home amoung you, our friends.  So the gimmick is this:  If you also have games, game books, or gaming-related paraphernalia that you wish to see move to a good home; bring them along.<br/>If you see something in the "Free Game Trade Area" that you would like to try out - especially at the rock-bottom price of "Free!", take it home with you. As long as we end up with less stuff to store at the end of the evening that we started with, we will consider it a WIN!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79209/#Comment_79209" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T05:16:26+00:00" title="July  3, 2007  5:16AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2007 5:17AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi David,<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about some directions to the store from the convention center?
