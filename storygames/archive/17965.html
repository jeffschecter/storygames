And then\u2026<br/><br/>"Baguette" contains<br/>\u2022 <a href="http://www.photographsoflightning.com/bat-shit/slammin/" rel="nofollow">Slammin'</a> (a turn-taking story game about sex-choked hipster assholes and their annoying lives), <br/>\u2022 <a href="http://www.photographsoflightning.com/bat-shit/tower-of-hats/" rel="nofollow">Tower of Hats</a> (a deep-head dungeon crawl that ignores SAN checks in favor of the real thing), <br/>\u2022 <a href="http://www.photographsoflightning.com/bat-shit/superhero/" rel="nofollow">Superhero</a> (a rules-be-damned action extravaganza with many guns and even more bullets),<br/>plus<br/>\u2022 The Slammin Token Master's Guide (to make your game of Slammin' all the more hip and douchey),<br/>\u2022 8 Slammin' character sheets (so you can get playing as soon as you receive this in the mail).<br/><br/>Baguette is a "Batshit" collection, which is to say that it's totally ridiculous - and though the games are, like, actual games <br/>that are, like, actually fun and work good and so on, they're also founded on hilarious jokes poked right into the eyes and <br/>hearts of games we know and love. <br/><br/>Here's the <a href="http://www.photographsoflightning.com/store/" rel="nofollow">direct link to the store</a>, which has the lovely new photos i took today. <br/><br/>Please leave questions, applause, thoughts, and NON SPOILER anecdotes below.<br/><br/>Once again, Joel, those would be NON SPOILER anecdotes and commentary. <br/><br/><br/>Thank you!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406219/#Comment_406219" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-14T10:11:07+00:00" title="February 14, 2013 10:11AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love these games.<br/>I almost want to buy them again.<br/>I need to play with <i>Temper</i> more.<br/>Tower of Hats seems impossible (so if you want a challenge, go for it), but it's worth it anyway.<br/>Slammin' gets the most love because it is hilarious.<br/>I regret to say that I've not yet played Anna, the Miller's Daughter or Superhero.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406221/#Comment_406221" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-14T10:46:35+00:00" title="February 14, 2013 10:46AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I got ridiculed when playing Slammin' because I wasn't acting hip or douchey enough.
