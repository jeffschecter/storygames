I ended up running multiple events a day, from 12pm to sometimes 5am. Most of my players were fans, writers, and developers of Paizo and Wizard\u2019s. I'm not going to name names. But I would say over 50% of the games, the players could care less about the fiction. I witnessed pacifist characters repeatedly murder and mutilate children because it made them feel powerful or they were in the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was bizarre.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the fault is my GMing style. I try to never railroad action or behavior. The story goes where the players take it. I feel like I'm on their ride and I go where they take me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt felt like playing grand theft auto where the fun for many people was running bystanders over with your car. Except I don\u2019t want that in my roleplaying games.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome dude carved up the body of a dead nun he knew that was just killed by a monster to make weapons out her bones.<br/>\n<br/>\nI talked to many people about it afterward and the consensus seemed to be that many wanted to use RPGs as a way to vent and do things they wouldn\u2019t be allowed to do in real life. Immersing and creating didn\u2019t matter as much as exerting power in taboo ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nTerry played quite a bit of Call of Cthulhu. We both really, really dislike the system. But at Gencon, CoC seems to attract players who care about the fiction we are creating together. And none of them seem that interested in the CoC system either. But the culture around the game is that it attracts certain players. So it\u2019s a safe bet if you want that specific type of play. Regardless of the fact that the rules better support hack and slashing than immersive horror gaming. The priority is finding people who share your interest. The system supporting your play seemed secondary.<br/>\n<br/>\nGencon was a very interesting experience this year for me. I felt sad I didn\u2019t see most of my friends but I wanted to really play with as many different people as possible outside our circles.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see the appeal behind White Wolf calling their games storytelling even if their system wasn't that different than D&amp;D.;<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm exhausted and I've lost my voice!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224958/#Comment_224958" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-16T22:10:18+00:00" title="August 16, 2009 10:10PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How did pacifist characters even get that far?

It was the night before the registration act vote and a character who was super strong and invulnerable was in the middle and trying to do everything he could to keep riots from breaking out. He started the game putting up posters, "violence is not the answer", "join us for a better way" and so on. Then a bunch of teenagers started heckling him and throwing soda cans at him. So he put down his "violence is not the answer" poster and burned one of the kid's faces off for heckling him. We paused the game and were like, dude, we have lots of characters to play, some who are pretty dark, do you want to play one of them instead of the pacifist? Or you can keep playing him if there is a specific place you want to take it. And he was like, what does it matter. That kid called me names and I took care of it. And then he went back to putting up non violence posters in a very non ironic way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224960/#Comment_224960" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-16T22:35:49+00:00" title="August 16, 2009 10:35PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>I talked to many people about it afterward and the consensus seemed to be that many wanted to use RPGs as a way to vent and do things they wouldn\u2019t be allowed to do in real life.

I facilitate a lot of games with the purpose of introducing new players to the kind of games i like (indie games, story games, story engines, alternative games or whatever). Mostly these people fall into two groups, people who either don't play role playing games games at all and people who play primarily mainstream roleplaying games. My experiences have been mostly very, very positive, but what I've found is that the first group is very interested in fiction. they want to create and tell a story. their characters have motives, drives and emotions. They are aware of the fiction they are creating, and will make choices that facilitate a better story over a better outcome for their characters. the second group often behaves in an opposite manner. they're interested in mechanical advantages, resolutions that favor their characters and winning. none of these are bad things, but this is also often the group that gets upset when things don't go their way, that isn't interested in outcomes that involve bad things happening to their characters, forgoes creating or using fiction in favor of getting what they want and looses interest when faced with adversity that can't be resolved through violence.<br><br>I always come away from these games feeling like traditional gaming is a very poor starting point for the kind of games I enjoy.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224962/#Comment_224962" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-16T23:00:05+00:00" title="August 16, 2009 11:00PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did that player make the choice to put up the posters or was that how the game was framed when it was started?

Culture always trumps system. That's always been known. <br>\n<br>\nContrary to popular belief, system won't make people play differently much of the time. It'll only support people who play the way that the system supports. If you do see a difference in how people play one system and then another, it's mostly likely because they're "ambidexterous" in terms of play-styles, and like playing both ways. Not that the system is taking a x-ist, and forcing them to play y-ist. <br>\n<br>\nBut the culture that plays Cthulhu aren't the way they are because of the material, nor are the vampire people the all moody because of calling Vampire:TM a moody game. The Goths existed as a culture prior to the game coming out, and migrated into playing it. Note that those traditional gamers who also migrated into playing VTM play it like D&amp;D. The Cthulhu folks, I believe, having been there through their formation, are a culture that results from certain political actions in the RPGA (scoring the CoC events on "role-playing" early on, as opposed to scoring on tactical proficiency). <br>\n<br>\nWhen my friends and I first came to CoC from D&amp;D and the like, we played it like we played D&amp;D.

You can, in fact, enforce your culture at the game table, if you want. <br/>\n<br/>\nJohn, the way you put it,<br/>\n<br/>\n"I try to never railroad action or behavior." <br/>\n<br/>\n... is interesting. Call this a snap diagnosis, but you sound like you have something related to "abused player" syndrome. That is, instead of being a player who clutches onto their character in terror, worried that the GM will take away your prerogatives, you're a GM who is fearful that your input will be seen as abusive. As though, to use a sensitive analogy, you're a father who was abused as a child, who decides to let their children do anything so that you can avoid any chance that your actions will harm them. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat would be terrible parenting. And probably isn't really good GMing. As a GM, in most cultures, you're going to have thrust upon you a mandate to control the social aspects of play. Not fair, shouldn't be the case, but it's how things often go. If this is the case, and you don't control these things, then the social aspect with a bunch of strangers (especially ones who do not know each other) will fall apart. <br/>\n<br/>\nScott, what with his occupation, understands this implicitly, I think. Basically this is the age-old con problem. How do you make a social group out of a set of players who really don't know each other? <br/>\n<br/>\nKnow what my solution to the problem is? I largely do not play with anyone that I do not know. Playing with the myriad people from this forum and the Forge, gives me more than enough players (I lamented to somebody that I hate the fact that I can't play with all of them each con). <br/>\n<br/>\nNow... I'm not suggesting that you should abandon the masses. As Scott points out, you can in fact make this work. It's just always going to take a bit more work. And I personally just don't see the point. But if you want to play with as many new people as possible, then you may well have to take the leadership role. <br/>\n<br/>\nNote that this is the real reason why the CoC games are better. Do you note how they all know each other? To the extent that they even annoyingly refer to their ongoing games, or previous games played together as in-jokes? While their games are relatively functional, what's going on is that they're guarding against potentially disruptive outsiders who occasionally stumble into their games. If you turn out to be non-disruptive, if you adopt their culture, then, in a year or two they might remember you, and you might be in.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr you can just go have a drink with them after the game (or however you socialize personally), and get to know them in a way they'll remember. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is, overall, to remember that a functional social layer is key to all play. If you don't have that, what you have is several people all playing different games at the same table. And what good is that?<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224995/#Comment_224995" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T06:09:39+00:00" title="August 17, 2009  6:09AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2009 6:10AM by madunkieg.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If that's what happened, without any significant omissions, then he's a dick, not for wanting to play out taboo power fantasies, but for how he behaved towards you. I know this because of the actions of one of my players who wanted to play the same style, but definitively wasn't a dick. If a game obviously isn't your cup of tea, there are a lot of things you can do (ask for a new character, suggest another game, or even just play along for a different experience) without just disrupting play. Even if the other players were okay with that action, you, as the GM, should have been considered (you're there to have fun, too, not just to serve the players). The same can occur with player who wants story play in a group of taboo-fantasy players.<br/><br/>Perhaps I see the split differently. Tactical/puzzle, power/risk, drama/story, these are all different groups to me (think of it as my alternative to GNS). The taboo vs. story play you describe I see occurring along a second axis, one of selfishness to group responsibility. Taboo play like you describe is extreme selfishness combined with drama (not power, as it's more about acting out than winning).<br/><br/>The role of the system is definitely secondary to finding the right group in the short run, but over the long term it is very important. Part of the reason that rpgs had a bad reputation is because the games attracte, amongst other groups, subculture of taboo-fantasy players, but didn't try to appeal to many other audiences. After a while, the medium of rpgs became associated with certain types of play. There are many ways rpgs are now pushing out of those stereotypes, including through the indie design market, parents seeking games to play with their kids, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224998/#Comment_224998" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T06:17:17+00:00" title="August 17, 2009  6:17AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jake richmond</cite><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>I talked to many people about it afterward and the consensus seemed to be that many wanted to use RPGs as a way to vent and do things they wouldn\u2019t be allowed to do in real life.

I facilitate a lot of games with the purpose of introducing new players to the kind of games i like (indie games, story games, story engines, alternative games or whatever). Mostly these people fall into two groups, people who either don't play role playing games games at all and people who play primarily mainstream roleplaying games. My experiences have been mostly very, very positive, but what I've found is that the first group is very interested in fiction. they want to create and tell a story. their characters have motives, drives and emotions. They are aware of the fiction they are creating, and will make choices that facilitate a better story over a better outcome for their characters. the second group often behaves in an opposite manner. they're interested in mechanical advantages, resolutions that favor their characters and winning. none of these are bad things, but this is also often the group that gets upset when things don't go their way, that isn't interested in outcomes that involve bad things happening to their characters, forgoes creating or using fiction in favor of getting what they want and looses interest when faced with adversity that can't be resolved through violence.<br/><br/>I always come away from these games feeling like traditional gaming is a very poor starting point for the kind of games I enjoy.<br/><br/>I\u2019ve had the same experiences. It seems that preconceptions dominate play. This tool is for this purpose. And the dominant tool prioritizes certain play. This goes with what Mike was saying as well. Conversely, I know many people who play fiction rich to start, say due to playing other games or doing improv and bring that with them to any game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224999/#Comment_224999" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T06:17:35+00:00" title="August 17, 2009  6:17AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: migo</cite>Did that player make the choice to put up the posters or was that how the game was framed when it was started?

But the posters were part of their character description. I\u2019ve often found that what the character sheet says, even when the players creates it rarely survives play once the things you thought you wanted are tested. I know this can be true for me. That\u2019s why I enjoy modifying my character as I play. But it wasn\u2019t about morality. In most cases, any action is fair game. It was mostly that the fiction didn\u2019t matter. <br/><br/>Actually, I think that\u2019s not completely true. <br/><br/>Part of writing this thread is me working through my own thoughts. To say the fiction didn\u2019t matter is probably an over simplification. <br/><br/>It\u2019s not fun if what you are smashing has no flavor and no connection to the world. Bold and evocative descriptions mattered to people. They wanted the world to feel real. I think many people didn\u2019t want to play a character. They wanted an immersive world they could manipulate, often in ways that they couldn\u2019t in the real world. <br/><br/>And hell, I think that\u2019s fun! I do it in video games all the time. <br/><br/>But sometimes I don\u2019t want that from my RPGs. And usually there were at least 1-2 other players in each game who also didn\u2019t want that. Which ties back to Jonathan\u2019s blog post. I think there is a strong desire to rename things as to separate people into games with more complimentary tastes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_225000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225000/#Comment_225000" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T06:21:47+00:00" title="August 17, 2009  6:21AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite>I don't think CoC so much encourages the fiction-lovers as it dissuades the power-venters.

Often the later 2 were also running games at the convention. <br/><br/>I would say the power fantasy players definitely detracted from the character / story immersion players. <br/><br/>In most cases we ate food together after the game or hung out for 20-30 minutes and talked about the game.

And it just didn\u2019t seem like you could do equilaterally when tastes varied so extremely. <br/><br/>I was also running for people who usually play, run, or write for D&amp;D most of the time for a very long time. But many of the same people wanted to play because they wanted something different, specifically not a dungeon crawl. And because they wanted to integrate more story heavy elements back into their games and work (use of relationship maps being an example). So although they bought into what we were doing, and knew very well what it was, I think the existing culture of play was very much overwhelming the games.<br/><br/>I\u2019m trying to paint a more accurate picture as I sort all the events in my head to mine for relevant details. You know, in many cases the power fantasy gamers knew each other.

Some of them had played Call of Cthulhu but this was one of about the 10 who hadn't. His experience was Vampire and 4th Ed. <br/><br/>When his group encountered a dead cop, his first statement was 'I loot the body!' Now all the groups did in effect 'loot the body' for handgun and notebook but their first concern was for the person rather than his belongings. Later on they managed to stop the bad guy from sacrificing someone (which lead to the exchange 'What are you doing? Is that some kiind of trick question?'), our bloodthirsty player immediately tried to shoot the bad guy. As the other players tried to stop him, the bad guy took advantage of the confusion to escape.<br/><br/>The one really significant difference between this player and the others was that he was 10, at least 8 years younger than anyone else.<br/><br/>As Ken Hite says, 'Call of Cthulhu is a mature game'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225020/#Comment_225020" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T07:21:13+00:00" title="August 17, 2009  7:21AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I met a group of four wonderful people, a tight group of friends, from near El Paso. We played Carry for two hours at Games on Demand. They laughed a lot during the game, and I wanted them to have a chance at the full (serious) Carry experience if they wanted it. When things started getting silly, I told them a story.<br/><br/>The first time I played Carry, Nathan was running it in the hotel lobby at Dreamation. It was a great game and it explored a number of racial issues. Mid-game, I look up at the tv above the bar and CNN is showing portraits of soldiers killed in action in Iraq. I quietly pointed my fellow players to the tv and we all quietly took that in and went back to our game. It was chilling.<br/><br/>Telling this story didn't stop the group from laughing and having fun, but it did change the tone a bit. They laughed but they weren't mocking the game or each other at all. I think there was some nervous laughter to reduce the tension, plus by Saturday people start getting slap-happy. <br/><br/>They were always very engaged with the fiction, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_225032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225032/#Comment_225032" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T07:59:03+00:00" title="August 17, 2009  7:59AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, agreed that would be terrible parenting. I\u2019ve walked out of plenty of terrible games and kicked out plenty of terrible players. We even stopped the game when people were being socially disruptive. By never railroad action or behavior, I mean completely in game. <br/><br/>For example, if a superhero wants to murder someone, I\u2019m not going to stop him. But then I will GM the game around their actions and make them central to the emerging story. Now society at large views the former hero and a super villain. <br/><br/>I love playing this way. I\u2019m a facilitator at heart. But there are many problems with this.<br/><br/>The person in question didn\u2019t understand why the world viewed him as a super villain. He wanted to remain a hero. The other players were ok with his actions. They saw it as an opportunity for great roleplay where their heroes turn against him. But the original person didn\u2019t understand it and didn\u2019t want player vs. player. After the game he described the children he attacked as obstacles in his way. He even made a joke about how much XP they might be worth. I\u2019m not sure how I would describe this disconnect. <br/><br/>Although I enjoy facilitating play, if you try to make everyone happy, you end up disappointing most people. I think my biggest problem might have been not picking a side.<br/><br/>Or to go with Scott\u2019s thoughts, you can\u2019t expect people to walk into a different play culture and just change how they play without strong guidance. I think I made a big mistake assuming that people are flexibly or ambidextrous as Mike calls it. Most of my friends play that way. But with strangers it\u2019s best not to assume anything. <br/><br/>Mike posed the question, \u201cHow do you make a social group out of a set of players who really don't know each other?\u201d<br/><br/>In this case it was probably even more severe. Not only do the players not know each other, but just like the CoC culture is very strong in how it reinforces specific play, so is the RPGA culture. So how do you make a social group out of a set of players who don\u2019t know each other and come from vastly different play cultures?<br/><br/>And I think Mike really nails it with:<br/><br/>\u201cThe point is, overall, to remember that a functional social layer is key to all play. If you don't have that, what you have is several people all playing different games at the same table. And what good is that?\u201d<br/><br/>And it certainly did feel like a bunch of people playing different games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225035/#Comment_225035" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T08:03:37+00:00" title="August 17, 2009  8:03AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>After the game he described the children he attacked as obstacles in his way.

I'm not exactly sure how to do this for other indie games - I've been really lucky that the other players are already into a Story Games mindset and don't require de-programming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_225048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225048/#Comment_225048" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T08:48:39+00:00" title="August 17, 2009  8:48AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>There definitely was a strong culture of, when it is someone's turn... do something insane.

Above when I said many people didn\u2019t care about the fiction, what does that really mean? I can say that in a superhero game, heroes work in the following ways. But that doesn\u2019t matter. Heroes act differently depending on the comic book. How the fiction works depends completely on the agreements, perceptions, and expectations of the players in the game. So to say they didn\u2019t care about the fiction might actually mean they didn\u2019t care about the shared fiction. Which requires listening, supporting, and communication.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_225065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225065/#Comment_225065" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T09:09:22+00:00" title="August 17, 2009  9:09AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If someone doesn't know what they want, it will be very difficult for people on message boards to work it out.

These exact people in front of me were the 1 person in these crazy games that I ran that I pulled aside after each game and was like\u2026 you are cool! Let\u2019s be friends. And we became friends. And yet these same people were telling me they hated playing with strangers. But then we would have never met! <br/><br/>I think it becomes a question\u2026 is it worth playing 28-32 hours of mixed games, and spending $500-700 to potentially find a new friend for life. I think so. Although those hours can be painful! Hahahahaha.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_225085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225085/#Comment_225085" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T09:57:36+00:00" title="August 17, 2009  9:57AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So when system doesn't matter (as in "I can run any game with any mechanical resolution system") and fiction doesn't matter, what the fuck actually matters?<br/><br/>It seems like "culture" provides a behavioral baseline. Like, it's okay to act out in outrageous and offensive ways because "it's just a game, don't get your panties in a wad." Or, you need to really emote and cry when your character is faced with hard choices because "this is Very Important Gaming we're doing here." Or all the just-gaming stuff you find in the middle. But I don't see that culture really does much except tell you what is okay to do and what is not okay.<br/><br/>I guess "indulge your Id right up to the point that someone else at the table shuts you down, knowing everyone else at the table is themselves unwilling to confront you" is what matters.<br/><br/>I saw this so much, running demos at cons long past. Didn't seem to actually matter which con.<br/><br/>I know it's the cultural norm at places like rpg.net to vigorously defend everyone's brand of fun, but this kind? The "indulge your id 'til you're told to stop" kind? Bad and wrong.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225088/#Comment_225088" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T09:58:34+00:00" title="August 17, 2009  9:58AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2009 10:00AM by merb101.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have had players who did whatever they felt like doing in the moment, then would hide behind their character actions and try to justify their actions as a player. For example, one guy played a mage in a D&amp;D game who was dark and mysterious, but all about triumphing over evil, protecting the innocent, etc. Then he encounters a race of little bear critters that feed off magic. They drained a couple of his magic items, basically ate the magic, and then wandered away, sated. <br/><br/>So he (having taken no damage) walks out, lobs a fireball into the room and slams the door, roasting all of the bears. His justification? "I was pissed they took my stuff."<br/><br/>To me it was just a prickish move. He didn't care about his character's motivation or personality, he just wanted to break something in the game that took something from his guy.<br/><br/>I also had a player who nonchalantly had his "hero" slit a guys throat while breaking into a building. We were all shocked and horrified, and it suddenly donned on the player he had crossed the line. So he played it that way, having his character wracked with guilt and doing increasingly villainous things until it all started catching up with him and he hated himself.<br/><br/>That was cool. He made his mistake/error in judgement as a player part of the character's story.<br/><br/><i>Edited to clean up some of my spelling.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
