It was Blood Games II. Before that, I got a free copy of Dreamwalker, sent to me by its author, Pete Spahn. Before that, I got a free copy of Dread, the horror game by The Impossible Dream -- and in return, I sent them a copy of my game. That was really cool. But their game is fucked up. It's like when you walk out the door late at night and you smack face-first into a huge web and there's a six-inch banana spider crawling into your eye. That's what Dread (Jenga) is like. Which is why I like it. And before that... Damn, it's been a while, but I guess I bought The Whispering Vault and Chill 1E.<br/><br/>So look, I need more. I want to pick up some more games. Obviously, there's a trend -- I like the dark stuff.<br/><br/>Tell me what to get. Give me your recommendations.<br/><br/>What I'm looking for: something dark and ugly. No princesses or fairy tales or games that are 'fun'. Not even if the princesses are secretly cannibals or whatever. You know how in Halo 3, you got these space midgets? And they talk like Smurfs and make silly comments? I don't like that. Let's steer clear of the 'cute' horror. While I know it has its place, and I can dig that some people like it, it's not my scene.<br/><br/>If you got a game you're working on, or maybe one that you've published, and it's pretty dark, tell me about it. If there's a game you've read or played, and it's cool, tell me about it. Don't bother telling me about the system, since I'm just going to run it with d20 (joking! joking!). Seriously, I'm mostly interested in the concept. So talk about the ideas that drive these games.<br/><br/>And while we're at it, here's a thought. As a video game designer, I spend a lot of time playing games developed by other studios. Not for recreation -- but for competitive analysis. Admittedly, part of the reason that game developers do this is so that they can one-up the other guys; but it's also done so that you can refresh your mind. Step back from what you're working on, see game development through someone else's eyes for a minute. It's an extremely effective tool, I've found.<br/><br/>I have found the same to be true about tabletop game design. What about you?<br/><br/>NOTE: I'm totally not trying to break Christopher Kubasik's balls, here, I think he has a valid point.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127479/#Comment_127479" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T04:55:34+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  4:55AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't Rest Your Head has a real edge of desparation to it, that might be up your alley.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127480/#Comment_127480" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T05:06:40+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  5:06AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I been hearing about that one.

You play members of the Grey Ranks, who are essentially under-age paramilitaries, teenagers pressed into service as child soldiers.  Hitler ordered Warsaw razed and everybody deported or killed.  It was some of the most harrowing street fighting of the entire war, and the Home Army was fighting with home-made guns and molotov cocktails for 63 days.  So it's a scene out of Dante to begin with - summary executions, bombing hospitals, roaming Azeri rape squads, I could go on but you get the idea.  And into the mix you get teenagers who have teenager issues about loyalty, family, love, and growing up. That's what the game is about.

It's about a world where everything you see is an illusion created by tiny individual animacules, including the people. The animacules only respond weakly to thought, so most people are trapped in the everyday reality created by many minds thinking alike. A few people though, the Solipsists, are so self-obsessed and monomaniac that the animacules flock to them and reshape reality just the way they want, which is great, except that a few of those Solipsists hesitate in their headlong rush into their own wish-fulfilment universes long enough to realise that something evil and horrible is eating the world out from under them, and try to do something about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Yokiboy" title="Yokiboy"><img alt="Yokiboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Yokiboy">Yokiboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127529/#Comment_127529" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T06:56:12+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  6:56AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Rafael,<br/><br/>Are you a fan of Dark City or perhaps Memento? If so, you must check out Keith Senkowski's <a href="http://erdtman.com/holken/untitled/" rel="nofollow"><b>Untitled</b></a>. It retails for $50.00 including shipping, but for that price you get a complete hand-made artifact, which you can use to enhance gameplay with. Just like with Lacuna Part 1, it feels like you're already playing from the moment you start reading the book. I think it is a game you would like.<br/><br/>As far as details goes, it should play best with 4, 6, or 8 players - the more the better. It features one player and many GMs. It's tagline seems to be "Why do I feel so fucking alone?" It comes with a premade setting, which is basically contemporary and it feels ready made to have the player play himself and really mess the fuck out of him by turning everything in his life upside down, but I'm sure a slightly less personal protagonist would suit some. You use a deck of regular playing cards, with two jokers, for conflict resolution. It has a built in endgame, which is basically the protagonists suicide, unless he can find hope before it's too late.<br/><br/>The outcome of conflicts change the stats of the protagonist and The Others (all the other players, or GMs). This is basically referred to as The Spiral. The game itself comes in a manilla folder, and uses it as The Maze. You add post-its to The Maze to represent important things to the protagonists, when introduced in a conflict they add to the cards drawn for the side they benefit. The protagonist player can manage to remove things from The Maze through play.<br/><br/>It's a totally fucked up horror RPG, with a large dose of Mystery / Sci-Fi / Thriller thrown in based on individual taste. It is perfect for a Dark City-like experience, or something like Memento. Where the protagonists life proves a big fucking charade and it all falls apart around him.<br/><br/>I think it will float your boat Rafael, but I'll be back to talk to you about some other cool choices such as The Farm, Cold City, Dead of Night, Lacuna Part 1, and of course Sorcerer.<br/><br/>Yoki                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127532/#Comment_127532" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T06:57:24+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  6:57AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>So it's a scene out of Dante to begin with - summary executions, bombing hospitals, roaming Azeri rape squads, I could go on but you get the idea.

What that means is up to the group, there are six different options in the book and no reason not to have more ... or to have finding out part of the game.<br/><br/>It will be available later in March. How much later depends on turnaround times are the printers and delivery to IPR and the like. It will definitely be out for Easter weekend.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127578/#Comment_127578" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T08:49:39+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  8:49AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rafael</cite><br/>Already got Sorcerer.</blockquote>\nOf course, if you have Sorcerer then you have <a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/12/12743.phtml" rel="nofollow">Dictionary of Mu</a>, right?

So is it basically about you trying to escape the Mad City?</blockquote>Sometimes. In the games I've played, at least one of the players usually decides their character is so done that they don't care any more and they just give up. The fucked up thing is that the players generally win conflicts, but it drives them on to greater despair. The game blows my mind with its ability to both let you win and hurt you at the same moment. One guy entered the Mad City with so much guilt that his issue was wanting to find peace and quiet. He ended the game by grabbing the head off one of the needle hounds and sewing his eyes, ears and mouth shut with their crimson thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127589/#Comment_127589" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T09:08:53+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  9:08AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: C.W.Richeson</cite>Of course, if you have Sorcerer then you have <a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/12/12743.phtml" rel="nofollow" shape="rect" target="_blank">Dictionary of Mu</a>, right?</blockquote>\nNo!

Sorensen. The game begins as soon as you start reading it. In my opinion it is a definite horror game, based on the game's backstory. Unfortunately I don't want to spoil the fun for other people that haven't played it yet, but check out the link, it should give you some idea of the kind of experience Lacuna Part 1 has to offer.<br/><br/><b>the farm</b> is another game by, perhaps my favorite designer, Jared A. Sorensen. He describes it as:\n<blockquote>...an experimental game dealing with the horror of imprisonment, terrible choices and the ruthless nature of survival. The players are prisoners ("residents") of "The Farm," a concentration camp-type environment where they're being kept until they're slaughtered for food. It ain't perfect but it's loaded with atmosphere and I'm especially proud of its Leader/Follower/Pig mechanics.</blockquote>\nIn summary it is to be played over six sessions, which each session bringing the Residents closer to being slaughtered. The Leader/Follower/Pig mechanic is awesome, and fits the theme very well.<br/><br/>I pitch <a href="http://erdtman.com/holken/pitches/cold-city/" rel="nofollow"><b>Cold City</b></a> elsewhere. In summary it's a game focusing on trust between the protagonists, in a situation where trust is hard to come by. It's about hidden agendas, trust and monster hunting, set in the divided city of Berlin shortly after the end of WWII.<br/><br/>Lastly, <a href="http://erdtman.com/holken/pitches/dead-of-night/" rel="nofollow"><b>Dead of Night</b></a> is a great little pocket game of B-movie horror. <a href="http://erdtman.com/holken/dead-of-night/" rel="nofollow"><b>I review it in fine detail here</b></a>.<br/><br/>Hope you find something you like Rafael,<br/><br/>Yoki                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127861/#Comment_127861" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T20:29:24+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  8:29PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2008 8:29PM by John_Harper.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.halfmeme.com/master.html" rel="nofollow"><b>My Life With Master</b></a> is a dark game of horror if ever there was one.
