I bought the rules, never did anything with 'em, paged through them last summer, got excited a little bit by a few of the ideas.  But on further analysis it just seemed like the game system didn't really do a whole lot to deliver "gothic horror."  Like, you had some super powers, and you had some blood-fuel, and you had a little humanity gauge that made you crazier as it went down, but that was essentially it.  It was smooth and simple, but it didn't seem to force you into actual horror stories very well.<br/><br/>In the last month or two, <i>Vampire: the Requiem</i> has been overhauled / rebooted / redesigned as <i>Vampire: Blood &amp; Smoke Strix Chronicles Spooky Words</i>.  Word is that <i>Vampire: New Spooky Words</i> "actually does what <i>Requiem</i> was trying to do" or something along those lines.<br/><br/>Has anyone read it?  Played it?  What is the verdict among the discerning aesthetes of the Story Gaming sphere?  I ask because I bought the dang <i>VtR: Not So Spooky</i> core books and don't feel like paying for an overhaul if it doesn't really do the trick.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426905/#Comment_426905" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-09T11:15:23+00:00" title="January  9, 2014 11:15AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've read it.

Cause it's nighttime.  How am I going to read the latest <i>Star Trek</i> novel?"  (I realize this is a trivial problem in <i>Vampire</i>: make your mortal check it out.  But it's the type of frustration that would amuse me to role-play.)  <br/><br/>Another vampiric moment came when I was waiting at the deli line, and these two women were asking the butcher to differentiate between two cuts of meat.  And I found myself trying to differentiate between the womens' necks to see who would taste better, and then recoiling like I was some kind of weirdo.<br/><br/>With <i>Vampire</i>, the game itself (as opposed to the concept of vampires), what I like about is that, WHAM, you are a drug addict and when really high you've got super powers.  But there are 5-20 other addicts out there too, and they're all competing for the same territory, some of whom are batshit crazy, and all of whom will fuck with your shit for no reason at all.  So to push back against these guys you need to fuel your addictive super powers; fueling your addictive super powers creates all kinds of shitty behavior and off-balance complications in the mortal sphere, and the rival addicts are just waiting for a chance to push you off a cliff when you're unbalanced.<br/><br/>(I am <i>intensely</i> disinterested in VtR's political parties.  I want a DiTV town you can never leave, where the repercussions from Sin keep reverberating forever, until everyone you know is a victim or a monster.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426920/#Comment_426920" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-09T12:57:41+00:00" title="January  9, 2014 12:57PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 9, 2014 1:12PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Therein lies the great weakness of <i>Vampire</i> as horror engine -- the irrelevance in play of vampires' impact on mortals.

Fred Saberhagen actually published the Dracula Tape in 1975 (a year before Interview's first edition) whch took a similar approach, but using Dracula itself as a model. Before Rice and Saberhagen the idea of the Vampire as a fully fleshed character capable of being the protagonist of its own story wasn't a going concern. <br/><br/>Rice was also one of the writers who laid the groundwork for the subgenre that we currently talk about as Paranormal Romance. The appeal of those novels has a lot to do with taking the fantastic (or horrofic) elements of fantastic and speculative fiction and then making the central plot element relational and emotional rather than the traditional conflict and challenge orientation. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426968/#Comment_426968" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-10T13:26:41+00:00" title="January 10, 2014  1:26PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In theory, the idea is supposed to be that vampires are trying to stay human, but are caught in a bunch of double-binds that make that impossible to sustain in the long term. The games are set up with the presumption that you want to hold on to your human identity and moral centre, and you want to survive that way indefinitely. Those are the players' goals. The challenge is that everything you have to do to survive requires you to make deeper and more disturbing moral compromises.<br/><br/>First, you need to harm or kill mortals to live from week to week. You can stalk strangers, or you can victimize someone repeatedly. So you get to choose: are you an opportunistic parasite, or an abusive parasite? You can put off feeding for a time, but the longer you wait, the greater the risk that you'll lose control and kill someone anyway. Or maybe, just maybe, you've confided in someone who gives their consent to let you feed from them. But if another vampire finds out a mortal knows about you, both of your lives will be forfeit. Not to mention what could happen if someone else in your feeder's life finds out about you.<br/><br/>Second, you need to compete with other vampires for status and resources, and they're formidable opponents. You have all sorts of supernatural powers you can use against them, but they often hide behind mortal dupes and pawns. How do you deal with them? And your powers typically fuel your hunger, meaning you have to feed more often. You can fight a war of attrition against other vampires, but it's not you who ultimately pays the price\u2014it's the mortals around you.<br/><br/>So, for me, the games are all about making awful choices in the most insanely messed up, no-win situations. It's all about discovering answers to questions like, What are you willing to do to survive? Who are you willing to hurt to be powerful?

Vampire the Masquerade has at least three major sources of tension. There's the quest to remain human, but there's also the titular requirement that vampires remain hidden. That conflict typically has more to do with conflict inside the vampire community. Then there's the political element which is almost entirely vampire on vampire. <br/><br/>If you're talking about paranormal romance as a genre that's not at all true. Depending on where you draw the line (I won't speculate, there's a lot of troublesome gender issues on where the line between "paranormal romance" and "urban fantasy written by a woman" is), but in a series like Gail Carriger's Parasol Protectorate  almost everyone is a "monster" of some kind. In general Paranormal Romance has as much or more flexibility as any other type of genre fiction.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426983/#Comment_426983" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-10T17:54:06+00:00" title="January 10, 2014  5:54PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, the Strix Chronicle doesn't change Requiem's general approaches on any of these subjects.<br/><br/>There's an optional Humanity system replacement in Danse Macabre that I like a lot better than Humanity for maintaining connections with mortals as a core element of gameplay, but it's optional, it's in a supplement, that supplement is not the Strix Chronicle.<br/><br/>It's best to think of the Chronicle as a campaign supplement primarily.

Actually, if one (not referring to you here) is not into occult horror and superpowers at all, I'd just play a straight-up Godfather game.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427063/#Comment_427063" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-12T14:45:31+00:00" title="January 12, 2014  2:45PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the new Strix Chronicles are just the end point of a second generation of Requiem books. Where they went from a very modular setting with a focus on the political covenants back to something like a "meta plot" and scarier Monsters, that are different from your regular Vampires. The Strix (however you do the plural of them). They did show up in the very well done Clanbooks for Requiem, who I made me like the game more than any stuff that came out before and gave those Clans, their own identities. More focus on the clans and Vampirism as a supernatural curse that you have no say in gave another option to play Requiem and the Strix are cool enough as enemies. The clanbooks also are cool examples of "What am I actually going to do with this" for the materials provided before them. The books about covenants were more about philosophies and choices the Vampires make about their unlife. Where the Clanbooks and Strix' are something that happens to them and likely won't change for the better.<br/><br/>I have not read the new book completely yet but I see it as a "How do I do the Strix from those clanbooks as a campaign" thing and more of the second generation of sourcebooks. Also more "What am I actually going to do with Requiem". So if you just got the core book and were wondering that, reading the Clanbooks in order of publication and Scary Words might not be the bad idea.<br/>You can do Story Gamey things with it too. But the NWOD rules are pretty trad, even if they aren't that intrusive either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427080/#Comment_427080" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-12T22:30:25+00:00" title="January 12, 2014 10:30PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed on the assessment of clanbooks vs. covenant books.

In the overhaul to the Humanity system they added a <i>thing</i> that ties your character to her humanity. This <i>thing</i> can be a person, place, or item, but the point is that it reminds them of or reinforces their human identity. This Touchstone gives you nice bonuses on Humanity rolls, but at the same time is a major source of trouble.<br/><br/>If your Touchstone's in trouble, there's a greater chance that you'll Frenzy. Losing a Touchstone is a definitive Breaking Point-what they've renamed <i>sins</i> to-and losing Humanity is even more painful than it used to be. Degenerations from pre-God-Machine Chronicle nWoD were bad and all, but now in <i>Vampire: Spooky Words</i> they've replaced them with Banes, which neatly encapsulate the <i>fun</i> problems vampires had in mythology like aversion to holy symbols, needing to be invited into private homes, and the like.<br/><br/>You can get new Touchstones, and it's heartily recommended, because otherwise you lose a couple of Humanity after a few feeding scenes and them lose the benefits of an attached Touchstone, even if the Touchstone is still around. Touchstones explicitly can't be full-fledged supernaturals, so you can't just vamp a lover to be with totes 4eva. This leaves them vulnerable to the machinations of your rivals.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this aspect in particular finally brought in that much-needed "human element" in an elegant way.<br/><br/>Also, the Condition mechanic means that Vampire finally gets to have "Sad Things Written on Index Cards" as part of the game, and that's just great.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427838/#Comment_427838" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-31T10:46:32+00:00" title="January 31, 2014 10:46AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed on both!<br/><br/>I have been using the Atrocity system from Danse Macabre for some time, I'm eager to try out Touchstones, I think it strikes a middle ground between the Humanity and Atrocity systems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427839/#Comment_427839" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-31T11:50:09+00:00" title="January 31, 2014 11:50AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Isn't that mechanic the same thing as Fetters from Wraith 1e?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BigDamnHero" title="BigDamnHero"><img alt="BigDamnHero" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BigDamnHero">BigDamnHero</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427841/#Comment_427841" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-31T13:00:55+00:00" title="January 31, 2014  1:00PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe.
