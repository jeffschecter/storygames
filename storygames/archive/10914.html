While she is debating Peter Rabbit vs. Little Ms. Chatterbox, I wander over to the RPG section.  I know there\u2019s nothing there I want, but I do like to peruse the covers and see what\u2019s being sold in my area.<br/><br/>There\u2019s a fairly large DnD section, to be expected.  There\u2019s probably a dozen little adventure modules.  There\u2019s some PHB\u2019s and other core books and some campaign settings. At the top shelf, something catches my eye.  It\u2019s a beige cover illustrated with a purple sash and a curved dagger tucked in behind it.  It\u2019s called Legend of the Burning Sands.<br/><br/>I remember well the CCG called Burning Sands from back in the 90\u2019s.  I was huge into CCGs back then.  I played nearly twenty different ones back then, so I pick the book off the shelf and check the back.  I guessed it was produced by AEG, and the logo on the back confirms my suspicion.<br/><br/>I flip through the inside.  It\u2019s attractive.  The layout is clean.  There aren\u2019t many illustrations, but that doesn\u2019t mean the inside was boring.  I did find a brief reference to the CCG inside, so that made me happy.  I compare it to the other books around and decide Burning Sands is fairly unique compared to what else is being sold in this area.<br/><br/>After flipping through a hundred pages or so, I decide to check the price. FORTY BUCKS!!!!!  With my free hand I grab the DnD PHB: $35.  I weigh each book in my hands and put myself in a buyer\u2019s shoes.  The real difference between the two games is mostly color.  You can create the Burning Sands experience for DnD by hitting Wikipedia and using your imagination.  Plus, I looked at all the adventure modules for sale.  Anywhere from $10 to $20.  It\u2019s so much easier.<br/><br/>A thought works its way into my head.  \u201cIs this how it ends?\u201d I ask myself.  AEG is a venerable company, the inheritor of FRP.  But I wonder how it can compete for entertainment dollars anymore with games like Burning Sands.  $40 can get you a lot of entertainment, not just in RPGs but anywhere.  Just in B&amp;N there were gobs of graphic novels behind me.  $40 will get you two or three of them.  Maybe more.  Just to my left were the Twilight novels.  Thoughts of Xboxes and Wii\u2019s danced through my head.  How can Burning Sands- which doesn\u2019t have the heritage L5R or DnD have- compete with all this?  Is the mainstream RPG market doomed to dwindle into nothing outside of DnD?  Is DnD Insider really the future of what our hobby will look like?<br/><br/>Anyone else ever feel this way when they look at gaming books at stores?<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242043/#Comment_242043" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-15T11:07:52+00:00" title="November 15, 2009 11:07AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 15, 2009 11:09AM by whiteknife.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Buying RPGs at bookstores can be quite expensive, which is why I try to avoid it unless I have some sort of awesome coupon. <br/><br/>If I'm going to buy an RPG at cover price from a store I'd rather give my money to a dedicated game store anyways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242062/#Comment_242062" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-15T14:49:10+00:00" title="November 15, 2009  2:49PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing bothers me about this.

Most niche-publishing books of similar format in color (think aviation stuff, but there are probably other examples) that go through retail have a price point of $60 at least, and the people who buy them get it - they understand that that's what a nice, full-color niche book has to cost. Mainstream gamers don't get this for some reason. They demand books be cheaper, but these days they're at least willing to pay roughly the same for black and white. AEG probably still won't make money on the book.<br/><br/>The PHB is mass-produced, but not in big enough numbers to really bring its price down to $35. That's an artificially cheap loss leader right there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242191/#Comment_242191" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-16T10:34:14+00:00" title="November 16, 2009 10:34AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If the Barnes and Noble RPG section falls back to being only D+D and a few other books that won't change much. Selling to the book market always was hard to impossible. Only the most mass appeal books ever made it there anyway. I don't think this will change much.<br/><br/>Maybe the D+D Insider is the future of most RPG play. Just as D+D books account for most RPG play now (though admittedly under various numbers Ed2, 3, 3.5). So no real change.<br/><br/>Story games have not broken out into the mainstream market and possibly won't. To break out they need their own star game. A game that can sell in the tens of thousands. We haven't seen that yet. What I can say is that it's not going to be a glossy print book. That business model has sailed. I'll be damned though if I know what it will be.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242237/#Comment_242237" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-16T14:40:05+00:00" title="November 16, 2009  2:40PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Troy_Costisick</cite>A thought works its way into my head.  \u201cIs this how it ends?\u201d I ask myself.

Sure, one generates a percentile result by rolling a twenty-sided die and another generates a percentile result by rolling two ten-sided dice. One has hit points and the other has hit points that result in minor penalties as they're ticked off. Etc. The color is different. The names are different. But the games are pretty much the same.<br/><br/>However, I think some mainstream publishers are starting to push the boundaries. WotC is a great example. Whether you like 4e or you hate it, WotC clearly put a lot of thought into the experience that they want D&amp;D to generate and designed the game to do that. It works differently than the other games out there.<br/><br/>I haven't seen it myself, but it sure sounds like Fantasy Flight is doing something different with Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 3e! <br/><br/>Weapons of the Gods is a game from a few years ago that I also think made a serious effort to create a unique experience. It's not without its problems, but there's a lot of interesting stuff there.<br/><br/>Sure, it's possible that mainstream RPGs wither and die. But it's also possible that these companies are going to have to actually design a new game to stay in business.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242294/#Comment_242294" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-16T21:56:54+00:00" title="November 16, 2009  9:56PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Troy_Costisick</cite>After flipping through a hundred pages or so, I decide to check the price.

Sure you can play with just the PHB (at least you could with 3rd no clue on 4th) but that's not entirely how it's designed.  While Burning Sands is meant to have it all in one book.<br/><br/>But as someone here mentioned.  Print runs determine a lot about the cost of a book, the more you print the less per book the printer charges you.  Anything for D&amp;D has a pretty nice sized print runs, probably the highest in the rpg industry, and is therefore cheaper.  That's just the way printing services work and have worked for year.<br/><br/>Now this isn't a new trend either nor is forty bucks a new high price for the market.  So I don't see it as a sign that anything is dying out.  It's not helping anything but currently seems to be the way things are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242344/#Comment_242344" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-17T05:10:23+00:00" title="November 17, 2009  5:10AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jim Crocker</cite><cite>Posted By: Troy_Costisick</cite>After flipping through a hundred pages or so, I decide to check the price.

If enough people don't agree that there's sufficient value for them to buy it, then they'll adjust, either by tinkering with the pricing structure, or altering their business model to deal with the smaller user base.<br/><br/>There's also all sorts of biases that go into these arguments. If I run a 3-year Burning Sands campaign out of just the core book, that costs me 40 bucks. If I get Netflix for 3 years, that's north of $300, plus the cost of a TV and DVD player. Now, those are 'sunk' costs, of course, but they are a required investment. Then again, if I buy snacks at every game, is that a 'cost' of the game, or would me and my buddies have had pizza that night anyway because we all got together to squeal over Twilight? And does THAT count as a cost associated with the movie?<br/><br/>The rapidly-changing media and entertainment market we're living through certainly makes things interesting (especially for me as a retailer of 'traditional' hobby games), and we're certainly seeing the midlist rattle out as the entertainment market deals with the lowering of entry points that result in a glut of product. But I think that projecting your own ideas about what constitutes appropriate entertainment value onto the entire market is probably over-generalizing.<br/><br/>-Jim C.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242676/#Comment_242676" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-19T06:03:11+00:00" title="November 19, 2009  6:03AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Troy_Costisick</cite>Anyone else ever feel this way when they look at gaming books at stores?<br/></blockquote>\nThis happened to me just yesterday when I was browsing the roleplaying section at my local Borders.  Tons of D&amp;D books, which is to be expected, and down in the corner a copy of <i>Mouse Guard</i>.

Why not?  Because it's physically smaller than the PHB?  I've seen it at my local Borders as well, and I'm pretty sure it's sold.  Because there were two copies the first time I saw it, and they were gone by the next time I came in.  Granted, I haven't seen it reappear and disappear on a regular basis (I think it took a month or so before I ever saw new copies of it there again, but it's possible it was restock and sold between my visits), but someone bought the thing.  I can't be the only one who's excited any time I see something that's not D&amp;D at Borders (I'm not trying to hate on D&amp;D, mind you -- I've heard many good and intriguing things about 4th ed -- I just wish it wasn't the only thing I can count on finding in a local physical store)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickNovitski" title="NickNovitski"><img alt="NickNovitski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/192/nO35O3RI2BE32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickNovitski">NickNovitski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242693/#Comment_242693" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-19T08:06:32+00:00" title="November 19, 2009  8:06AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            People like <i>Mouse Guard</i>.

As roleplayers <i>of course</i> we're going to see the overall value of a roleplaying game relative to other media.  But we're a niche audience.  The real test of roleplaying's longevity is the ability of the games to sell themselves to non-roleplayers, and that's when the comparisons to other media become valid.  To many roleplaying is weird, even alien, but buying a movie or a graphic novel is perfectly natural.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244201/#Comment_244201" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-30T02:33:08+00:00" title="November 30, 2009  2:33AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 30, 2009 2:37AM by Alex F.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's where my thoughts are with this too. If I'm coming to it cold, I am not considering making a $40 purchase on the assumption that I and 4 of my friends will be sinking fortnightly Sundays for 6 months into exploring this product. I am thinking: <i>is this something I will play?</i> (or even just:<i>read?</i>).<br/><br/>Consequently I think a nice pricing approach would be to place it closer to other single-session activities, tweaking as necessary for shiny stuff (if it has a colourful board and miniatures in the set, then price closer to a high end board game. If not, price closer to a standard fiction book).<br/><br/>The industry tends to price closer to an expert text than a mainstream book. In some ways I can understand why but I think it's doubly offputting: firstly the raw price and secondly the fact that you only pay that much for "special books" - coffee table or technical.<br/><br/>If it's got the coffee table feel - luxurious, easy to open and browse - then okay, it might be earmarked as a present for that special someone into that special something, but it's unlikely to be picked up on a whim. <br/>If not, then it screams "serious business! not for casual users!" - which is a shame.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244202/#Comment_244202" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-30T02:42:52+00:00" title="November 30, 2009  2:42AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So what about the new WHFRP 3rd Ed with an RRP of $100?
