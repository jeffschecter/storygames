The cool thing is that the wizard can command the imps. If he uses their <b>nickname</b>, they can interpret his commands in whatever fiendish way they like, though they then become more under his control (represented by a control meter that dictates how slavishly the demons have to follow the wizard's commands). If he uses their <b>true name</b>, they have to do what he says and interpret generously, though they gain more freedom on the control meter.<br/><br/>The thing is, other than those rules, the game basically says, "hmm, GM fiat everything". And the structure of play resolves around scenes that are tied to locations &amp; events--like, the players are supposed to move from "Imprisoned in the House" to "the Cafe" to "The Grand Cafe" and so on. I could see this working if the game gave me any sense of how it's supposed to work, but it doesn't, and it reads to me like I'm supposed to set up a scene and let the players go, but if they don't go in the right direction I'm all, "okay guys, so you need to get to the cafe". What I'm saying is: why are the players playing? It doesn't seem that they get to make any interesting choices. I like the premise of the game a whole bunch, but I feel like either I'm missing something or the game is missing something (that I would need to be able to play it).<br/><br/>Any help?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ignotus" title="Ignotus"><img alt="Ignotus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ignotus">Ignotus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344777/#Comment_344777" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-03T18:56:58+00:00" title="October  3, 2011  6:56PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've run it.   It's fun, though not revelatory.  It runs like any investigation-oriented game that largely proceeds from location to location.  If you've ever run a CoC adventure or something you should know the drill.  The fun part is the characters continually bickering and vying for power with each other while slowly learning about their comrades abilities and hidden agendas.  The payoff for this is in the final scene where the interests of the various PCs abruptly diverge.  Don't overthink it and I suspect your players will have a good time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344791/#Comment_344791" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-03T21:53:40+00:00" title="October  3, 2011  9:53PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ignotus</cite>It runs like any investigation-oriented game that largely proceeds from location to location.

I've run InSpectres, but that's totally a different kind of investigation game. I think this isn't the game for me, then.<br/><br/>Too bad, it has promise, but the conventional style kinda kills my interest (and I'm just not sure I know how to run it).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344883/#Comment_344883" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-05T01:14:50+00:00" title="October  5, 2011  1:14AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll post here one last time in the hopes of hearing from Matthijs and Tomas (and anyone else who's in the Norwegian Style book).

I was also the editor of the text; it's been restructured a fair bit from the original draft.<br/><br/>It is a bit of an illusionist/participationist scenario, in that yes, the GM is supposed to railroad - to make sure that characters go from scene to scene. It's a common style of con play. <br/><br/>The fun for the players is to see how the adventure packs out, to enjoy the silliness of the situations. Especially the interaction with the demons is key.<br/><br/>Personally, it's not a style of play I like very much anymore. I'm too lazy as a GM and too choosy as a player, I guess. <br/><br/>I suggest just getting the group on board with this: "I'm going to set the scenes, and cut them; sometimes I'll tell you what the characters have been doing in the meantime. Your job is to give each other some resistance and some challenges with your characters, but not so much that you completely derail the plot."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344965/#Comment_344965" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-05T17:28:22+00:00" title="October  5, 2011  5:28PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, thanks. That helps a lot.
