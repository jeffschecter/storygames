If they choose to split up, then everyone will get less time in the spotlight. This simple fact will usually corral them back together, like "Oh, oh - and just then, I walk back in the room!"<br/><br/>Make sure players who aren't spotlighted still stay focused and involved, though. It find it rude and obnoxious when players ignore the game unless it's their "turn".

We're currently at 4 players, but can fluctuate as high as 6. I'm friends with everyone at the table, and don't want to tell any of them not to come to the game. I do agree that 4 is critical mass. The most successful and productive sessions I've ever had were with 3 - 4 people.<br/><br/>Thanks for the input everyone, it's definitely appreciated. The thing is, I'm like most GMs in that I avoid party splits as much as possible. I'd like to learn to do it better though, because when thinking up situations to toss the group into, limiting myself to "eveyone has to be there" is, well, limiting. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jzn" title="jzn"><img alt="jzn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jzn">jzn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94799/#Comment_94799" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T13:47:08+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  1:47PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2007 1:48PM by jzn.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I second Constant Dude's method (or, Martin, rather?

I understand it might not work for you.<br/><br/>1) 4 or less players<br/><br/>2) I don't play with parties.  Each character is interesting in his or her own right, and each is building a thread in the tapestry that is the whole story.<br/><br/>3) Pick games that involve thematic material and hinge on interesting character choices instead of mechanical effects and results.  (Examples:<i> PtA, Sorcerer, Shock, Grey Ranks</i> et al...)  I ran a game of PtA at a con recently, and one of the players had only played <i>D&amp;D</i> before this.  After the game I asked him if he was bored during the scenes of another character -- did he have that impulse to go off and read a magazine.  He said, "Well, at first I thought I'd be reading the Order of the Stick book I just bought downstairs, <i>but everything was so interesting I just wanted to keep listening</i>."<br/><br/>Human choices are interesting to human beings.  it tends to hold the attention of others even if their character is not in the scene.  (People who haven't experienced this don't believe it's possible, but it's true.)<br/><br/>4) Many of the games above, in one way or another, let a player mechanically influence a scene that 'belongs' to someone else.  Fan Mail in <i>PtA</i>, Minutiae in <i>Shock</i>.  Mechanics like this work really well for this issue.  <br/><br/>5) Cut across scenes frequently.  Build to a moment of crisis or climax, and then shoot over to another player.  <br/><br/>How I play obviously isn't for everybody.  But since I've dumped the whole concept of "the party" I'm getting the kind of play I want.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jzn" title="jzn"><img alt="jzn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jzn">jzn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94808/#Comment_94808" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T13:57:15+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  1:57PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2007 1:57PM by jzn.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James McMurray</cite>I've sometimes solved this by giving the other group a combat as well.

That's where I am and that's the concept I sell to all my players.<br/><br/>You just ask yourself how the players are going to benefit more from the group split. Should the players whoise characters are not in the scene witness it? Or will they benefit more later from not knowing? At first when I started asking myself that question, I'd fail sometimes. I would realize later that the players should/shouldn't have been witnesses. And as time goes by, as you try the technique more often and you know yourself, your players and the games/moods you are going for, the answer to that question becomes easier and clearer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94835/#Comment_94835" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T15:29:27+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  3:29PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2007 3:29PM by John_Harper.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>&gt; Cut across scenes frequently.

It actually got to where the guy with the best Russian accent played the NPC Kerrn chief, so we as a group started to think of that guy as his NPC.  I think the only time where I might do a "GM plays all the NPCs" is during a scene where all the PCs are involved, so as to not violate my own "talking to yourself bores everyone else" rule.<br/><br/>I like how <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em> handles this with Scrips, as the players are the scene pacers enforced in a mechanical fashion.  They can refer to another player and essentially offer to do a cut-scene to that person.  I'm not sure how well this would work with a "everyone plays NPCs" vibe -- worth a try, but there's a certain vibe that passing around Scrips has that might be lost that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94996/#Comment_94996" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T07:31:22+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  7:31AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This discussion fascinates me, because we're seeing several dichotomies in play style that dictate what will or won't work for your group for this "problem." A lot of it comes down to a divide between the people who think that "story-games" are indie-forgey games, and the other contingent are a set of newer people to this site who seem to feel that more traditional games are "story-games." While it's up to Andy, if anyone, to decide the focus of this site, I'm going to assume that we're being ecumenical, and that for the moment we'll include traditional RPGs here. But the readers should note that the dichotomy does exist, and that this informs the posts above. <br/>\n<br/>\n(I really can't emphasize how different these styles of play are. It's not just a cosmetic thing, it's fundamentally different. I wouldn't go so far as to call them unrelated activities, but I'd be tempted to do so just to get traditional players to understand the difference. )<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat it comes down to, largely (and Martin gets credit for being the first to identify it), is the question of what's sometimes called the "stance" of the player with regard to their character. "Actor" stance assumes that the player is making decisions on the part of the character based only on what the character knows. Often this is desired because of some factor like "immersion." The key technique here is to keep player and character knowledge unified, so that the player doesn't have to go through the mental gymnastics of trying to forget what they as a player know that the character does not. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is as opposed to "Author" stance, where the player can be better thought of as the author of the character's story. As authors of characters in novels do, these players use their knowledge of things that the character does not know, in order to make play more interesting. Note that there is a subset of Author stance called "Pawn" stance, where the player has the character make decisions that are implausible - where the character acts with knowledge he does not have, and that only the player has. Much as one would do with a pawn in a boardgame. Most author stance play is still plausible, but still informed by things that the character does not know. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere's where I usually give an example to make this clear. Consider a situation in which Player A's character is getting beaten up in a park, and Player B's character is having a drink in a bar, not far off. The GM indicates that the bar is closing, and asks player B what his character is doing. <br/>\n - Actor Stance Player: "My character goes home."<br/>\nThe character doesn't know about the fight involving Player A's character, so the player cannot decide to have his character go help.<br/>\n<br/>\n - Pawn Stance Player: "My character goes and helps out his buddy!"<br/>\nThe player ignores the fact of his character's ignorance of the fight, and has his character respond as if he did. <br/>\n<br/>\n - Author Stance Player: "My character heads home, but on the way back decides to take a stroll in the park."<br/>\nThe player is acting to get his character into the fight to help his friend, but doing so in a plausible fasion. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, the dichotomy that I mention largely splits down the line where the "indie-forgey" story-game players like myself will tend to prefer Author stance play. Wheras the indications of the more traditional players here is for actor stance play, and techniques that support that. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, since this is James' thread, and he's obviously a more traditional gamer, this is why you get Chris saying things like "this might not work for you." What he's saying is that, barring a pretty radical change in play-style, our techniques won't work for you. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in a way, we're being subversive here. What we're saying is that one of the nifty benefits of our style of play is, quite simply, that problems like "splitting the party" simply vanish entirely. The concept of the "party" dissapears completely, and all play is, non-problematically, a series of scenes that involve whatever characters make sense to include. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo be clear, there's no attempt to "reimburse" players for them not having had the spotlight, because:<br/>\nA) They'll get it when it's their turn, and<br/>\nB) When it's not their turn, they're as engaged in play as when it is their turn. Different, but no less interesting. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis mode of play is more about being the "Audience" to the character's stories, than "being" the character. This is what, largely, is meant when people say "Story-games" intending it to be indicative of something different than traditional RPGs. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, we can discuss the benefits of this mode of play til the cows come home, and it won't benefit James one bit if he's not interested in trying this mode of play. So, James? Do you want feedback on this sort of play? Or do you just want comments on the problem as it pertains to the traditional mode of play?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the latter, I can at least explicate the problem in detail. The real issue at hand with "party" play is that you have two conflicting motives for the players:<br/>\n1) They want to all stay together so that they don't lose time playing, since, if they split up, they want to ignore (or even be separated from) the actions going on where their character is not. <br/>\n2) They want to play their character as they think their character would act. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis leads to really difficult situations, with different solutions. Many players just give up, and stop asking the question "Why is my character going along again?" Basically they either come up with excuses why their character is always with the other characters, or they simply move to pawn stance, and just don't bother to justify why their character is doing what it does. And Pawn stance itself can be frustrating. Especially this sort, where the player is basically giving up on being proactive at all, and simply following some other participant's lead (often the GMs). <br/>\n<br/>\nOther players, unwilling to give up control of their characters this way, will do things like split up the party, beause it's what they feel that the character would do. In fact, in really dysfunctional cases, the player may feel that they're not enjoying play, and simply seek to avoid control, falling into what is sometimes called "My Guy" behavior. Where the player justifies everything that they have the character do based on "it's what My Guy would do." <br/>\n<br/>\nEven in non-dysfunctional cases, then we have the issue as James presents it, where, because players are being plausible with their character's actions, the group splits up, and then everybody gets less enjoyable play time (though, that said, there's an argument against this, too, that says that parties already split up screen time, even when together). <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, again, there's this constant conflict of interest - the player wants control of his character, and, yet, the player wants to stick with the party. <br/>\n<br/>\nContinued...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94997/#Comment_94997" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T07:31:34+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  7:31AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2007 7:32AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...from above. <br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, there are some simple solutions. One of them is the "Mission" approach - the concept is that the "party" is a team of some sort (maybe they work for the queen), and they are assigned missions to perform. This gives them strong excuses to stay together. The challenge in this case is that you have to work hard to get personal issues into play for each character (see Law &amp; Order for how), or you have to ignore that entirely. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother simple solution is just to accept pawn stance as the standard for play. A lot of entertaining dungeon crawling play does exactly this. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut in each case, you're losing something to gain "party" unity. If that something isn't important to you, then you have your solution. But for many groups, they want to have their cake and eat it, too. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLikewise, the style of play that we (Chris, JBR, John Harper, myself, and, less so, Andy) espouse could be seen as giving up a little on "immersion" of the sort that requires separation of player and character knowledge (or, at least, investment in the knowledge that the character doesn't have). But that's not something we value, hence why we've moved in this particular direction - well one reason. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that helps shed some light on the nature of the problem. Understanding it should help in determining in which direction you'd like to go in obtaining your personal solution to the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jzn" title="jzn"><img alt="jzn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jzn">jzn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95008/#Comment_95008" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T07:53:07+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  7:53AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, I appreciate that you're addressing the intent of the meaning of Story Games on this board, and I especially enjoyed your comments about the different stances (pawn stance irritates me to no end, except in video games).  <br/><br/>But I don't understand how indie and traditional RPGs are so different in this particular arena.  The dilemma is merely "how do you keep the other players engaged when the story starts to focus on one or two PCs".  Lots of story games have rules for doing this, but it's not intrinsic to the separation of trad/indie, is it?  In a game of Dogs, for instance, you can encounter this problem.  The text encourages you to always pay attention and shout out ideas, but that can't really be called a mechanic, and doesn't go too far towards making me not bored while another player obsesses over his dice during a long conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95017/#Comment_95017" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T08:17:53+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  8:17AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, good point. Some indie RPGs do more with this, some less, certainly. And it also could be argued that it has less to do with the designs in question, and more with the traditions of this group of players 'round here. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut if you look closely at DitV, there are some really subtle things going on with the mechanics, and not just in the textual exhortations (I, too, give little credence to the efficacy of such). Is "say yes, or roll the dice" a mechanic or a technique? Eh, I'm not too concerned. Let's look at how resolution works instead. The DitV mechanics subtextually say to the player, "You can feel free to push for what you're character believes in... but he'll pay the price." But look at that "price." What's subversive is that fallout is actually positive stuff for the character in some ways. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis sort of player informing by the mechanics (and I'm sure with more time I could think of better examples), does seem to produce the sort of play that our kind wants to see. The player is told that they're supposed to be interested in their character's failure... like an author would be. There are lots of other parts of the mechanics that do this, too. The initiation mechanic, for instance, informs players that conflicts tend to be one dog at a time, and are very personal in nature - not group goal activities. In the end, what we see when playing, are players who don't have their character in the scene, but who are just as engaged in play as if they were playing their character. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, here's the million dollar question, and one that I've asked before in the open on the Forge. Is it really the system that's at work here, or the culture? I mean, it's certainly possible that you may have had the party problem playing DitV. The claim that might get made, however, and one that might rankle, is that what's going on there is that you're applying your cultural norms of play to DitV, and not being informed by the rules. It's your "fault" for not following the spirit of the game the mechanics try to support. <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course this is BS to some extent. That is, if the mechanics were really powerful, they could actually alter your behavior. Right? You fould fire back that it's solely our culture causing the phenomenon in question, not the mechanics. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat can be said about something like DitV isn't so much that it creates a specific behavior. But that it reinforces that behavior. That the system, used by people with our predilections, works excellently well for our goals (and this is from multitudinous great actual play posts, to say nothing of my own experience with the game). If you don't share those goals, then it may well not have these sorts of benefits for you. <br/>\n<br/>\nContrapositively, I've seen players here play D&amp;D using "Story-games" principles, ignoring what D&amp;D supports, and getting Author stance play out of it. System doesn't dictate at all. It's only a question of support. I've often asked these Story-gamers why the heck they would want to use D&amp;D, since I think that there are systems that'd work better for them. But that's not me doubting that they're getting the sort of play they're looking for. That's me thinking that they might get it with less effort with a different tool. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNot to derail this thread, the point is that, it's not just playing DitV (or systems like it) that'll eliminate the party problem. It's accepting (even wanting) that Author stance sort of play - and using technique to reinforce this - that'll eliminate the party problem. As for what that technique is, lots of other people are laying that out nicely. But, again, it's useless to James, even if he plays DitV, if he doesn't want that sort of play - if he refuses to give up on that sort of immersion that he's got in his present games. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95023/#Comment_95023" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T08:36:42+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  8:36AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think one of the issues is that in a typical game-table situation, the GM will lay out the scenario, and players speak up when they have something to contribute.<br/><br/>Some of the foregoing suggestions have revolved around the idea that one or more players are effectively "out of the action", and giving the other players things to do.<br/><br/>However, when different PCs are just beating down different paths, both are progressing at the same time, it's just a matter of the GM forgetting and the "off screen" player being held in stasis, because the situation has changed and the GM is not used to it, in that:<br/>1) they just don't remember to "cut scene" at tolerably short time intervals, and/or<br/>2) they don't take explicit steps to ensure that both PC groups have about the same amount of activity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95031/#Comment_95031" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T08:56:17+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  8:56AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2007 8:57AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it's definitely a skill. This is why a game like PTA actually has rules that reinforce this. In a more traditional game, at the very least I'd suggest establishing a system of going "around the table." As for cutting, that's part of a whole raft of skills called "scene framing." Which takes a lot of work to get used to. But I can give one simple bit of advice. Whenever you hear yourself saying, "What do you do next?" stop yourself, and do one of two things:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Create some new information for players to respond to, instead. Or,<br/>\n2) Consider that it might be time to cut to another scene. Even if everyone is together, it may behoove you to just move the situation forward, instead of asking the players to make something up. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou don't always have to do either of these, but the urge to say, "what do you do next?" can be a good cue to think about it. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Scene framing, while particluarly important for "story-gaming," can be just as effective in any style of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95033/#Comment_95033" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T09:00:18+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  9:00AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love to hear from James again, to provide some guidance about what's going to be useful to him at this point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95034/#Comment_95034" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T09:01:46+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  9:01AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Now, we can discuss the benefits of this mode of play til the cows come home, and it won't benefit James one bit if he's not interested in trying this mode of play.

I just want to address two points:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>This mode of play is more about being the "Audience" to the character's stories, than "being" the character. This is what, largely, is meant when people say "Story-games" intending it to be indicative of something different than traditional RPGs.</blockquote>\nI want to clarify this (or, perhaps, state the way <i>I</i> see this issue): I've observed that "being" the character happens all the time in these wacky story-games.  The way you've phrased it above suggests that the Players are someone how not engaged as or with their characters, and I just haven't seen this.<br/><br/>What I have seen is players <i>alternating</i> between being their characters with being an Audience to the character's stories.  This is what's new.  In a lot of game groups, being in-character is the default position: it's where you belong and to leave it is to be playing wrong.  Hence, the moment it's not your scene you are lacking any function or role in the game.  Some people are sent from the room; others are encouraged, as best they can, to sort of "ignore" what's going on in another PC's scene.  But no matter how you slice it, if you're only function at the table is to "be" the character and nothing else, when you aren't getting a chance to be the character in a scene, you got nothing.<br/><br/>By opening up the possibility of Players not only being in-character but also happily as audience members, the Players are allowed a role at the table no matter if their PC is in a scene or not.  Sometimes this is reinforced with mechanics ("Pay attention to these other scenes -- you can do things!") and sometimes it's just the fact that the game's imaginative elements draw the players imaginations together in interesting ways and the players want to pay attention (in <i>Sorcerer</i>, all the PCs share the notion of Humanity, and Players, I've noticed, tend to want to see what people do when Humanity choices roll down the road.)<br/><br/>The proportion of in-character to audience can and will vary from player to player and group to group, of course, and how far one invests in-character is another variable.<br/><br/>But I think it's fair to say that when Players are playing their characters the option to being the character is fully present.  And then, when the Player wants, they can take that character off and be fully engaged as an Audience member and participant.<br/><br/><br/>Second, \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>(I really can't emphasize how different these styles of play are. It's not just a cosmetic thing, it's fundamentally different. I wouldn't go so far as to call them unrelated activities, but I'd be tempted to do so just to get traditional players to understand the difference. )</blockquote>\nI posted this on the Gateway thread, but I'll repeat the story here:<br/><b><br/>So, it's midnight Sunday night, and all of us who had just played <i>Shock! </i>with Judson facilitating have stumbled into an elevator and are riding it down to the lobby.  We've all had a great time and are chatting it up.<br/><br/>And as the doors open and we start to get out, Evan, one of the players, is a friend of Judson's, and Judson roped him into the game.  Evan is a board gamer, and he came for the board games.<br/><br/>So, Evan says, "Okay.  Maybe someone can help me with something. I haven't played a role-playing game since Dungeon &amp; Dragons fifteen years ago."  He pauses.  "What was <i>that</i>!?"</b><br/><br/>Imagine how strange it would be to have played D&amp;D over a decade ago, and then get dumped into a <i>Shock</i> game without any of the intervening steps of <i>Dogs</i> or whatever?  That's the moment I realized how strange and different these games had become.  Even the games that don't <i>look</i> that radically different are pretty different.  Many people look at <i>Sorcerer</i>, see that you roll dice in conflict, and go, "Well, what's the big deal."  But the fact that there's a player authored Kicker on that character sheet, the fact that there's no party, the fact that there's no mechanic for killing the PC -- these are big deals when compared to how most people assume an RPG "should" work.<br/><br/>Then throw games like <i>Shock</i> or <i>Primetime Adventures</i> or <i>Dogs</i> at people and assumptions about mechanics, the roles of players and even what an adventure is in terms of prep goes right out the window.<br/><br/>You're right.  They are related.  But sometimes we underestimate the differences.  And to speak of these things without being clear about that -- which I sometimes do -- is to be crazy-misleading.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95041/#Comment_95041" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T09:10:16+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  9:10AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris, you've made a devil of me, in that we've now derailed the thread as I feared!

We all try to be egalitarian with time and attention.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95071/#Comment_95071" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T09:52:26+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  9:52AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Chris, you've made a devil of me, in that we've now derailed the thread as I feared!

But now you've delved into Director stance (using characters - or anything else - as a GM does to create situation). Which is even less traditional. I mean if the players are in a different room, because they're not in the scene, it's going to be hard for them to play the NPCs, no? If you take my meaning.</blockquote>\nTraditional doesn't instantly equal "make them leave the room." At least not for us. In general I avoid telling people to leave the room if at all possible. The only time it's happened in recent memory is when two of the players were coordinating how best to take down a third because one of the conspirators was actually an enemy in disguise and the other was convinced the target PC was being controlled by a demon. In that case I didn't suggest they leave the room, they did it on their own.\n<blockquote>Sounds like James is actually on the cusp here. Will Iook like an elitist if I suggest to him to come over to the dark side?</blockquote>\nWell, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4094&amp;page=1#Item_22" rel="nofollow">the next session</a> I GM will be very freeform and involve a lot of player control over scenes. There won't even be dice. Does that count any? :-)<br/><br/>I'm definitely interested in other styles, and when I proposed my diceless session to the group one of the replies was "I don't think our table has a problem with new games or concepts. Plan it up and toss it at us." But on the flip side, what we do now is fun too, and I don't want to risk culture shock, so I'm not in any great rush to convert.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95146/#Comment_95146" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T11:33:50+00:00" title="September 12, 2007 11:33AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95156/#Comment_95156" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T11:42:48+00:00" title="September 12, 2007 11:42AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James McMurray</cite>There won't even be dice.

They'll let even stodgy traditional players participate in scenes when they're not there, and therefore have fun and contribute to the group's fun, but without breaking their precious character immersion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Julian" title="Julian"><img alt="Julian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Julian">Julian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95995/#Comment_95995" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T11:15:25+00:00" title="September 14, 2007 11:15AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Control pacing. All the separate groups are moving toward a goal. Cut between them frequently, and use your control of screen time to do your best to have everybody reach the dramatic climax of their thread at the same time.<br/><br/>This is especially important when those dramatic climaxes are going to be complex mechanical situations. Even if you care about the outcome of a fight, sitting there with nothing to do while the mechanics are engaged isn't all that thrilling, whether the game's Dogs or D&amp;D. Run the conflicts in parallel. (This is easier when all the conflicts are using the same basic mechanics.)<br/><br/>More importantly, people will be engaged by what's happening when they're off-stage if they care about it. If the other characters' problems interest them, they'll be engaged. If they don't, no set of mechanics can make them care. The supposed indie vs. traditional dichotomy here is mostly in the fact that 'indie' games are often strongly character-focussed. More interesting characters are more likely to create the necessary feedback loop, especially when you add in collaborative world/character creation mechanics.<br/><br/>You can reinforce this by snarling the characters' connections together. One character's argument with his brother isn't necessarily engaging, but if the brother is also another character's rival, that player is more interested in the scene. Similarly, you can tie the situations together.<br/><br/>Even if the situations don't directly tie together, create parallels. Make the theme of the day revenge, or missing family members.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
