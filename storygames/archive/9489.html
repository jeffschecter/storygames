I have always regarded the road from fiction to roleplaying as a one-way street: any backward influence is corruption and contagion. I have never read a single 'game novel' in my life, even though some of them are supposed to be pretty good, and authors like Brust, Feist, and Moon are basically ruined for me because I see where the gaming influenced their fiction. Ditto a lot of good younger authors; even if I like their line and their storytelling, when I recognize gamerisms I immediately lose my ability to enjoy the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel the same way about tabletop RPGs with respect to computer RPGs. They can emulate us, but any backward influence is contagion. Any signs of computer RPG tropes in tabletop RPGs is bad bad bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nAside from their irrelevance to what will happen in the world, these strike me as prejudices which stunt my aesthetic judgment. So I guess I'd like to get over them.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo help me with that, can any of you point to a place where RPG elements have influenced fiction, film, etc. in a positive way?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210377/#Comment_210377" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-04T13:37:42+00:00" title="June  4, 2009  1:37PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think a big influence is the need for contemporary fantasy to explain everything in terms of how it "really" is.

Basically everything is a science and naturalistic from the point of view of the internal fiction.<br><br>Once upon a time fantasy had more of a horror story aesthetic where that stuff was unexplainable, unknowable and terrifying even from within the fiction itself.

A few RPG concepts (leveling up, hit points) pop up in Brian Lee-O'Malley's comic Scott Pilgrim. Admittedly, these references are usually played for humor, the idea of crossing some arbitrary threshold leading to a sudden and noticeable improvement in one's abilities. Nevertheless, they lend a good deal of nostalgic charm to the series.<br/><br/>From my time working at Electronic Arts, I know that one of the reasons there are extensive catacombs under Hogwarts is because J. K. Rowling was trying to help out the designers of the Harry Potter videogames by creating a canonical place where players could "grind."<br/><br/>Children's show Dora The Explorer is presented much like a videogame. Dora's friends Map and Backpack help her through her adventures in ways that should be familiar to anyone who played adventure games in the late 80's to early 90's.<br/><br/>Good god, Pokemon. Just all of it. Any kid who has grown up with Pokemon has RPG concepts in their blood. This show bends drama around structures of turn-based combat, levelling up, questing, adventure parties, shopping for items at stores. I mean, it's not Shakespeare, but there's the potential for pathos here. When these kids hit 30 and start getting Michael Bay-esque adaptations of their childhood, we'll see just how much.<br/><br/>As a designer of electronic and unplugged games, I'm of the opinion that design is design is design, and it really doesn't matter what environment a concept first becomes popularized in if you can find a way to make it work in your current project. "Good artists copy, great artists steal," and all that. The fact that MMOs honed in on the idea of bluntly basing character classes around a taxonomy of playstyles (tank, controller, buffer, etc.) doesn't taint that practice for use in tabletop games, because there's no reason why a tabletop designer couldn't have thought that one up first (you could argue that tabletop games like AD&amp;D already did this anyway, just not very well).<br/><br/>Can you give me some examples of what you're talking about, with respect to computer RPG influence on tabletop games?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210402/#Comment_210402" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-04T15:38:46+00:00" title="June  4, 2009  3:38PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2009 3:39PM by Brian_Minter.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Johnson</cite>The fact that MMOs honed in on the idea of bluntly basing character classes around a taxonomy of playstyles (tank, controller, buffer, etc.) doesn't taint that practice for use in tabletop games, because there's no reason why a tabletop designer couldn't have thought that one up first.</blockquote>\nGood point. <br/><br/>I don't play D&amp;D 4E, but I know some people who do, and they like the increased niche-protection that came from adopting these MMO concepts (tanks, healers, strikers, etc).

VERY gently .... suggest that a lot of the stuff you're thinking about can't really be laid solely (or even significantly) at the feet of RPG culture. Genre fandom in general pushed the genre in these directions, because it created a distinct market segment and subculture.<br/><br/>40 years ago, nobody had a rich body of prior art in genre fiction to look to as a model. They had scattered, obscure stuff that didn't even look like a coherent genre... and most of it was trashy as all get out.<br/><br/>Today, we have creators who've spent their entire lives immersed in fandom, with a canon of genre influences that is so rich it has internal schisms.<br/><br/>So 90% of their output is derivative of their influences. Like 90% of all creative work, ever.<br/><br/>There are some specifically gamer-y elements there, for sure. But if you really have to blame any specific thing for the dominance of setting-centric quest narratives in fantasy fiction, you have to go back to Tolkein's embrace of the heroic epic, and the 70s American SF renaissance creating a generation of fans who wanted to know how everything worked. I think you could probably throw some pain in the direction of Marvel Comics and Nintendo, if you wanted to look a little deeper.

In an MMO, since all players are paying money to participate, it's best if each player is able to contribute usefully all the time.  4E gives each participant a variety of (hopefully) interesting options every round, and pretty much every round requires a decision, which keeps people engaged in the tactical game.<br/><br/>Also, I wouldn't mind seeing gamemasters and module designers adopt CRPGish means of pointing out clues and significant scenery.  In Mass Effect, for example, I don't have to pixelbitch an entire space station to discover the plotworthy bits -- they are highlighted on the screen for me.  I've played in (and run, alas) quite a few tabletop games where it felt like I had to blunder down every blind alley in the scenario to have any hope of understanding what was really happening.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210584/#Comment_210584" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-05T13:05:44+00:00" title="June  5, 2009  1:05PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Brian,<br/><br/>I'll concede that point, and readily, though I interpreted the entire cosmos of Perdido Street Station as an extended satirical riff on DnD.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210586/#Comment_210586" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-05T13:10:35+00:00" title="June  5, 2009  1:10PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hexabolic</cite>I'd second China Mieville.

Edwards - no, not at all. Although I was thinking tonight about how Howard's story setup style is actually useful if you want to combine action-adventure and 'narrativism' into a single game. Put the scheming nobles and the sex and the dungeon all into the same castle, or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nBWA - George Martin's writing is self-contained. Maybe he's influenced by his gaming but the serial numbers are filed off at least; his fictive realities are 'pure'. I'm not a huge Martin fan (though I have enjoyed his work) but I think he's got some craft.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhereas - in Moon, Feist, and Brust I get to certain pages and say 'this is a fucking D&amp;D; adventure.' And I LOVE LOVE LOVE me some D&amp;D.; I mean, I'm a driving force behind Fight On!, for weird pete's sake. But I don't want gamerisms in my fiction.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I read a prizewinning story by a good younger fantasist about a year ago. The idea was good. The characters were so obviously a fucking niche-protected RPG party I wanted to puke. No RPGisms anywhere. But hives, in me, anyway. That guy could write and I wish him well. But not for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this is a bad prejudice on my part. But maybe I'm just reacting to bad craft. Because I expect a good writer could use a lot of this same stuff and it wouldn't bug me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went in for therapy a few years ago. The guy made a comment in a certain way - no reference to twenty siders or system weirdness or any of that, it was just his intonation - and I knew he was a gamer. Turned out he was Gary Gygax's co-DM for the original tournament run of Vault of the Drow. I didn't hate him at all, in fact he helped me finish my PhD. I owe him a lot.

There are certain films that I watch and I think, "This is a fucking play."   There is no vision in the photography direction, but rather it blindly uses rote shot sequences while adapting a dramatic storyline.  Stage plays obviously had an enormous influence on film, much of it very good.  However, just shooting a play does not make a good film.  <br><br>It seems to me that is what you are talking about here.  Not RPGs influencing fiction, but rather having gamerisms in fiction that do not work.  <br><br>RPGs have influenced fiction in many ways.  To some degree, world-building is an influence of Tolkien -- but RPGs significantly changed the tenor of that.  Planned world-building and the systemization of magic are RPG heritage, I would say.  I think that nearly all of the Tolkien-influenced fantasy is also RPG-influenced.  That includes close imitations like Terry Brooks, but also everything from Patricia Wrede, Tamora Pierce, and Terry Pratchett.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210843/#Comment_210843" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-08T02:40:17+00:00" title="June  8, 2009  2:40AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I share your prejudice, Cal.
