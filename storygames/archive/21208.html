That is to say: of course you can make games without character advancement, and of course it's going to be a good or a bad idea solely on the basis of what the game is trying to do, and how character advancement plays into that. You won't be the only person ever to have created a game that is not a modestly hacked D&amp;D clone.<br/><br/>There is an audience segment that will reject your game if it does not have character advancement. However, that same segment - "traditionalists", or however one might term it - will also reject it if it doesn't have foot-loose adventurer characters, party-based gameplay, long campaigns and a strong GM. If your game is otherwise a traditional adventure game, then it may make commercial sense to have advancement for non-artistic reasons. A different kind of game will not gain on the market merely by including this feature, because other audience segments will not care.<br/><br/>Personally, my only opinion on this matter is that you as the designer should have passionate opinions about what it is that people do when they're playing your game. It is conceivable that character advancement falls into a blind spot in this regard, but it is much more likely that it's something on which it is well possible to form an opinion. Do that, and craft the game accordingly. I won't be turned off by having character advancement, or not having it, but I will be bored by a game that does not take a stand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464737/#Comment_464737" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-10T15:58:17+00:00" title="July 10, 2017  3:58PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Leave it out to make the statement that players should not strive to keep using characters, but be aware that some tables will do so anyway and probably hack in an advancement system.<br/><br/>Add an optional rule to have some control over what the hack is, but also encourage players to keep using characters.<br/><br/>My take: add a first-class bomb rule that lets you "advance" your character after ~a handful of sessions for a great short term effect and long term loss of effectiveness so players can have their characters "go out with a bang".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464739/#Comment_464739" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-10T16:48:58+00:00" title="July 10, 2017  4:48PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, how does it affect adding an advancement mechanic to the rest of the game mechanics and overall atmosphere?

I wrote a long comment with some advice for people who are starting to get into design and what the process was like for me.

So I edited it.  <br/><br/>When I do put a dot it's usually just because I screwed up and did a double comment.

I know since I had one for a long time. In every game I made (most of them scrappy little heartbreakers but anyway) I obsessively added an advancement system. And not just any system, but something that tried to mimic the feel of the system that was in Runequest: I always tried to measure the in-game actions of the characters and tried to tie the advancement into that.<br/><br/>I think it is better to judge seriously whether the game really is better with the advancement system and base the decision on that.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464898/#Comment_464898" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-19T19:40:06+00:00" title="July 19, 2017  7:40PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Peter_Perry" rel="nofollow">Peter_Perry</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>This post nails it, in my opinion.

For instance, in <i>Follow</i>, you, a group of like-minded individuals, move towards a distant goal. <br/><br/>The "advancement" that happens is that a) you move closer to your eventual goal, scene by scene (although this isn't in question), and b) certain characters get killed off (or lost) along the way (which <i>is</i> something you play to find out).<br/><br/>That's certainly fun, but isn't, strictly speaking, any kind of "player reward" nor "character advancement.<br/><br/>That's why I prefer to think of it as a change in the state of the game - how does it transform over time?<br/><br/>Witnessing transformation over time allows us to have a sense of progress and achievement (which then becomes the reward).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Perry" title="Peter_Perry"><img alt="Peter_Perry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Perry">Peter_Perry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464901/#Comment_464901" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-19T20:34:38+00:00" title="July 19, 2017  8:34PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 19, 2017 8:38PM by Peter_Perry.">edited July 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul,<br/><br/>"reward" is indeed supposed to be loose in the sense I meant it in my comment. That's because all that "reward" means is that the game needs to have elements to keep player interest. It doesn't need to be strictly mechanic, but there has to be something in the game's design that manifests itself through gameplay and generates interest for the players to keep them playing. It could certainly be simply a social phenomenon with no built-in mechanical rewarding system. An example: in Primetime Adventures, just letting players set scenes, choose characters for scenes, etc is already a reward in the sense I mean it. That empowerment of the players allows them to add a lot of creative input and that is extremely satisfying for them and keeps them coming back for more. You mention "a change in the state of the game", and that's fine as a reward too, as long as in practice whatever form that takes manages to sustain player interest due to the way the game is played. But changes in the state of the game by itself, or a common goal for the players, is not a universal solution for every game. Some games will need more than that to sustain interest, especially if long term play is intended.<br/><br/>Not sure if I was clear. Anyway, I don't think we are actually in disagreement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464906/#Comment_464906" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-20T03:06:30+00:00" title="July 20, 2017  3:06AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Indeed!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/empowermint" title="empowermint"><img alt="empowermint" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/empowermint">empowermint</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465029/#Comment_465029" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-25T14:30:42+00:00" title="July 25, 2017  2:30PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the sound of characters gaining talents/phobias in a pulp horror context!

You start out with adventures that effect one or two people, then slowly climb up the ladder to adventures that effect whole kingdoms. There's no mechanical effect, just a narrative one.
