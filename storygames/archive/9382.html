But, I need some cards help! Here's the problem:<br/><br/>What are the probabilities that when you draw X cards from a deck (without replacement), that any 2 of the cards you draw are:<br/><br/>1) The same color (black or red)? [EDIT! Asking for black OR red is dumb, as posters pointed out it's 100% after 3 cards. Instead, assume I'm after red matches). <br/>2) The same suit (x2 clubs, or x2 diamonds, etc.)? [EDIT! Same thing. After 5 cards, match is 100%. So, assume I'm after Hearts OR Diamonds.]<br/>3) The same value (pair of 5s, pair of Aces, etc.)?<br/><br/>All for when X is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7?<br/><br/><br/>That's already tricky (well, for me anyway). Now the much tricker part. What happens when other people are playing, too? That is, basically, what happens when A, B, and C (or A+B+C?) cards aren't available (because other people are getting cards, too)? A,B,C also would range from, say, 2 to 7.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone" title="Quintin Stone"><img alt="Quintin Stone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://rps.net/QS/Images/pipboy-32x32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone">Quintin Stone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207962/#Comment_207962" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-18T11:40:36+00:00" title="May 18, 2009 11:40AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Someone please correct me if I'm wrong...<br/><br/>These are the basic numbers:<br/>1) Half the cards are red, half are black.

You'll have to draw your little binomial trees.  I can't do ascii but for the Red Black question with two draws it would look like this.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst draw:  Branch One:  50% chance of Red. Branch Two:  50% chance of Black<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond Draw is either:<br/>\nBranch One-a:  49% chance of Red, with Branch One-b 51% chance of Black (first draw was Red) or<br/>\nBranch Two-a:  51% chance of Red, with Branch Two-b 49% chance of Black (first draw was Black)<br/>\n<br/>\nThus there is only 1 path through the tree that gives you 2 Red:  Branch One (50%) followed by Branch One-a (49%) the probability of both draws being Red is thus 50% *49% = 24.5%<br/>\n<br/>\nTo do 3 draws you'd need to go down another level in the tree:<br/>\nBranch One-a-1: 48% chance of Red, with One-a-2 being 52% Black (Where first two draws were red)<br/>\nBranch One-b-1: 50% chance of Red, with One-b-2 being 50% Black (where first draw was Red and second Black)<br/>\nBranch Two-a-1: 50% chance of Red, with Two-b-2 being 50% Black (where first draw was Black and second Red)<br/>\nBranch Two-b-1: 51% chance of Red, with Two-b-2 being 48% Black (where first two draws were black)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can see there are 4 paths through this tree that yield two Red:<br/>\nOne-a-1, One-a-2, One-b-1, and Two-a-1<br/>\n<br/>\nThe probability of One-b-1 is 50% * 49% * 48% or 11.76%<br/>\nThe probability of One-b-2 is 50% * 49% * 52% or 12.74%<br/>\nThe probability of One-b-1 is 50% * 51% * 50% or 12.75%<br/>\nThe probability of Two-a-1 is 50% * 51% * 50% or 12.75%<br/>\n<br/>\nThis part I'm a bit fuzzy on, but I think you can just do the usual probability addition here:<br/>\n<br/>\n(11.76% + 12.74%) - (11.76% * 12.75%) = (24.5% - 1.5%) = 23%<br/>\n(23% + 12.75%) - (23% * 12.75%) = (35.75% - 2.9%) = 32.85%<br/>\n(32.85% + 12.75%) - (32.85% * 12.75%) = (45.6% - 4.2%) = 41.4%<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the chance of 2 Red on 3 Draws is 41.4%<br/>\n<br/>\nYou'd do the same thing where X is even larger numbers but you can see your binomial tree begins to get exponentially bigger with each additional draw.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou'd also do exactly the same thing for your other questions, but for suits each level would spawn 4 branches and for individual cards each level would spawn 13 branches making the calculations even more arduous.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's the blunt force trauma way of doing it.  Some code monkey has probably already automated it somewhere, however.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207996/#Comment_207996" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-18T13:40:49+00:00" title="May 18, 2009  1:40PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 18, 2009 1:56PM by Matt Snyder.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (NOTE: I'm posting this before reading Ralph's post.

With 2 cards, it's 1 - 26/51or 49% With 3+ cards, you'll match two by color 100% of the time.<br/><br/>Same suit? 100% minus the chance that all the cards are different suits. With 2 cards, there's a 39/51 chance of drawing two different suits. With 3 cards, there's a 39/51 * 26/50 chance of drawing three different suits. With 4 cards, there's a 39/51 * 26/50 * 13/49 chance of drawing four different suits. With 5+ cards, you'll always find at least one match. So you'll match by suit 23.5% with two cards, 60.0% with three cards, 89.5% with four cards, and 100% with five or more cards.<br/><br/>Same value? 100% minus the chance that all the cards have different values. With 2 cards, there's a (12*4)/(52-1) chance of drawing two different face values. With 3 cards, there's a (12*4)/(52-1) * (11*4)/(52-2) chance. With 4 cards, there's a (12*4)/(52-1) * (11*4)/(52-2) * (10*4)/(52-3) chance. The formula generalizes to<br/><br/><tt>       1 - ( 4^(n-1) * [ 12! / (13 - n)! ] * [ (52 - n)! / 51! ] ), </tt><br/><br/>where n is the number of cards drawn, ^ is raising to an exponent, and ! is the factorial operator. The "1 - expression" is a reminder to subtract the whole thing from 1 to get the chance of it NOT happening.<br/><br/>Here's an Excel formula (A2 is the 'n' value): <br/><br/><tt>       =1 - ( 4^(A2-1) * ( FACT(12) / FACT(13 - A2) ) * ( FACT(52 - A2) / FACT(51) ) ) </tt><br/><br/>Plugging in values of n {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}...<br/><br/>n=2, p=5.8%<br/>n=3, p=17.2%<br/>n=4, p=32.4%<br/>n=5, p=49.3%<br/>n=6, p=65.5%<br/>n=7, p=79.0%<br/><br/>Enjoy!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208006/#Comment_208006" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-18T14:03:43+00:00" title="May 18, 2009  2:03PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Snyder</cite>That's already tricky (well, for me anyway).

This is a calculation of "successes" based on a population of 52 cards (without replacement). If I understand this correctly, the Hypergeometrical Distribution is the thing we want. <br/><br/>The chart above has a "Draw" column on the far left. This means how many cards did a person receive (i.e. draw). Then, each other column shows the probability of a number of successes (in this case for matching colors, for which there are a diminishing numbers, starting at 26, then 25, etc.). <br/><br/>Let's start with the easy one. If you draw 2 cards, the ONLY possible number of successes is 2, of course. The probability for that is: 24.51%.<br/><br/>It gets trickier when you have more than 2 cards. If you have 5 cards, for example, you could have 2 successes for what I want. But, you could also have 3, 4 or 5 successes, too! That means we have to add up the cumulative chances. What we want is the inversion of what most poker hand caculations want. They want "at most". Here, I want "at least" 1 match, but I'll take 2, 3, 4 or 5 matches. Neat. That means the cumulative chances matter.<br/><br/>So, if you draw 5 cards, the probability of getting <i>at least</i> 2 cards that match color is: 82.51%.\n<pre>MATCH SUITS\tSuccesses\t\t\t\t\t\t<br/>Draw\t2\t3\t4\t5\t6\t7\tCUMULATIVE<br/>2\t5.88%\t0.00%\t0.00%\t0.00%\t0.00%\t0.00%\t5.88%<br/>3\t13.76%\t1.29%\t0.00%\t0.00%\t0.00%\t0.00%\t15.06%<br/>4\t21.35%\t4.12%\t0.26%\t0.00%\t0.00%\t0.00%\t25.73%<br/>5\t27.43%\t8.15%\t1.07%\t0.05%\t0.00%\t0.00%\t36.70%<br/>6\t31.51%\t12.84%\t2.60%\t0.25%\t0.01%\t0.00%\t47.21%<br/>7\t33.57%\t17.58%\t4.88%\t0.71%\t0.05%\t0.00%\t56.80%</pre>\nThe rest of the charts work pretty much the same. Here are chances for a matched pair of the same suit. <br/><br/>So, if I draw 3 cards, I have an overall probability of 15.06% to get <i>at least</i> two cards that have the same suit.\n<pre>MATCH PAIRS\tSucesses\t\t\t\t\t\t<br/>Draw\t2\t3\t4\t5\t6\t7\tCUMULATIVE<br/>2\t0.45%\t0.00%\t0.00%\t0.00%\t0.00%\t0.00%\t0.45%<br/>3\t1.30%\t0.02%\t0.00%\t0.00%\t0.00%\t0.00%\t1.32%<br/>4\t2.50%\t0.07%\t0.00%\t0.00%\t0.00%\t0.00%\t2.57%<br/>5\t3.99%\t0.17%\t0.00%\t0.00%\t0.00%\t0.00%\t4.17%<br/>6\t5.73%\t0.34%\t0.01%\t0.00%\t0.00%\t0.00%\t6.08%<br/>7\t7.68%\t0.58%\t0.01%\t0.00%\t0.00%\t0.00%\t8.27%</pre>\nAnd, of course, getting pairs (like, a pair of Jacks) is the toughest one. <br/><br/>Say I get seven cards. That's a lot. Well, even then I still have only a 8.27% chance of getting <i>at least</i> two cards that are the same rank.<br/><br/>Note that in poker (with 5 cards) it's even harder to get a pair. That's because this chart shows the cumulative chance for getting <i>any</i> pair. Well, in poker, "any" pair here might be a three or four of a kind or even 2 different pair. So, those other hand cobinations "gobble up" some of the slightly more generous probability I show here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208008/#Comment_208008" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-18T14:10:29+00:00" title="May 18, 2009  2:10PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam's got the right approach - work out how likely it is the opposite of what you want will occur, then subtract that from 100 percent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208011/#Comment_208011" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-18T14:15:25+00:00" title="May 18, 2009  2:15PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 18, 2009 2:19PM by Matt Snyder.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Notes of clarification.<br/><br/>Tim, you're right about drawing 3 cards means automatically getting same color.

So if you're matching color and you have 3 red then you have 3 successes?<br/><br/>Edit: Okay, the links were shorter than I thought.  It's not a Hypergeometric distribution because what constitutes a success is not constant.  In hypergeometric experiments a set subset of what you are drawing from are called successes.  So, for instance you could set all the club cards to be successes.  But that is different from your question because you don't care about getting pairs of clubs, you care about getting a pair of any suit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208024/#Comment_208024" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-18T15:06:00+00:00" title="May 18, 2009  3:06PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tim, you're correct, this isn't hypergeometric. <br/><br/>I agree with Adam and the half dozen other people I apparently cross-posted with <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208026/#Comment_208026" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-18T15:09:33+00:00" title="May 18, 2009  3:09PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 18, 2009 3:10PM by Matt Snyder.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tim, turns out I do care about getting pairs of clubs.

Basically, if you have to use the word "or" it won't be hypergeometric, because what counts as a success is not constant.  So, if you want matches of red cards, it's hypergeometric.  If you want matches of hearts or diamonds, it's not.  If you want matches of jacks, it is; if you want matches of any rank card, it's not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208032/#Comment_208032" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-18T15:36:37+00:00" title="May 18, 2009  3:36PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt, if you're specifically looking for red successes then you're correct, it can be viewed at a hypergeometric problem.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> is easy, hypergeometric with half the cards being 'successes' (assuming no jokers)<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%232a&amp;Mode=like">#2a</a> is also easy, hypergeometric with 1/4 of the cards (13) being successes<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%232b&amp;Mode=like">#2b</a> could probably be easily computed by figuring out the inverse (one heart, one diamond, any number of others)<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%233a&amp;Mode=like">#3a</a> and b are tougher, are you trying to match the first card you drew or any card you drew?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208069/#Comment_208069" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T01:00:34+00:00" title="May 19, 2009  1:00AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another consideration, Matt:<br/>\nare you concerned with whether a single play draws the results, or whether any player in the group draws the desired set before the deck is reshuffled? That makes it a lot more complicated! (e.g. What is the chance of one or more players in a group of 4, drawing a pair of aces, when they each draw a hand of 5 cards?)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if players have the ability to add cards to their hand, you need to re-calculate using the increased hand size.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208099/#Comment_208099" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T08:23:55+00:00" title="May 19, 2009  8:23AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, I'll explain the mechanic I'm chasing after with these probability queries. <br><br>I have a tendency to over-design mechanics. I love to make them intricate things that have neat options and all kinds of information from one stroke. And, playing cards are usually better than dice because each card has so many variables like color, rank, and suit.<br><br/>I recently went back to my game chef 2008 design, The Lady Killers. I forgot how much I liked the design, which I had to abandon due to the time constraints of the contest. There were some sketchy notes about a mechanic where players tried to match ranks by playing 2 cards from their hands.<br/><br/>Fast forward to a week ago or so. I rediscovered the design, and started blowing the dust off. Right away, I knew the mechanic was ignorant of the possibilities. But, there was something elegant in there.<br/><br/><b>The Mechanic</b><br/><br/>Players draw a number of cards based on their character scores. Numbers likely will range from 2 to 7. So, players are drawing anywhere from 2 to 7 cards. LIkely, most draws will be 2-4 cards.<br/><br/>To resolve stuff, a player looks at his or her hand and picks any 2 cards to play. Playing any 2 Red cards is a success. Playing any black cards is a failure. Easy. Turns out a draw of 2 cards will create success 50 percent of the time. PERFECT. Just what I wanted.<br/><br/>Of course, I can't leave well enough alone. I've got to tinker, damn it! That's where more of the probabilities weigh in.<br/><br/>First off, I'll use the difference between the cards as a consequence. Think fallout. You play an Ace and a 9, then you've got 8 points of "pain". Matched pairs are great because the difference is 0. That's a "best" result.<br/><br/>Second, here's a way to break down results: <br/><br/>Any two black cards: Failure! Risk pain to others.<br/>Any two Clubs OR Any two Spades: Failure, but with player's input. Risk pain to others.<br/>Any two red cards: Success, but with GM input (small complication, I guess). Risk pain to yourself.<br/>Any two Hearts OR Any two Diamonds: Success. Risk pain to yourself.<br/><br/>Third, now I want to tinker with a way to make face cards do special stuff. Here, I'm less interested in the probabilities, although I may have to chase after that later. Something like this: <br/><br/>Any (red?) jack in your 2 cards = gain a nickel<br/>Any (red?) king in your 2 cards = gain a dime<br/>Any (red?) queen in your 2 cards = gain a quarter<br/><br/>(Which leads me to the alternative of using black face cards to make players "pay" more, i.e. black king means you have to pay a dime. See? Told ya' I like to fiddle too much.)                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208123/#Comment_208123" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T10:38:40+00:00" title="May 19, 2009 10:38AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Snyder</cite><br/>To resolve stuff, a player looks at his or her hand and picks any 2 cards to play.

The probability for getting 2 red cards in a 2 card draw is going to be about 25% (26/52 * 25/51 ~= 24.5%).<br/><br/>It's interesting how you only risk pain to yourself if you succeed.  How does it work if there are two characters acting against each other, do you compare hands somehow?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208127/#Comment_208127" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T10:48:50+00:00" title="May 19, 2009 10:48AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2009 1:39PM by Matt Snyder.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tim, good point. I think I'm getting my numbers all mucked up. I'm going to have to go back and re-examine all the previous posts. <br/><br/>EDIT! Gah! I am getting my numbers messed up, but it's still good news. I just forgot I was talking about a draw of 3, not 2. Draw of 3 gets 50 right on the money. Great!<br/><br/>As for your question -- how do two characters opposed one another? There are two possible answers (and keep in mind this is still early design here): <br/><br/>1) The players compare the difference of the ranks they just played. If one character has "more pain" than the other, that character loses out.<br/><br/>2) I'm planning on a bunch of exceptions-based stuff that tinkers with this resolution. So, a player might have 4 cards. She plays 2 of them for the match. But, she still has 2 cards left. I'm thinking of stuff like "Play that extra face card to remove 1 of the other player's cards, and explain what happens in the fiction." And, so there's a kind of give and take exchange with "cool powers" flying around.
