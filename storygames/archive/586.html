<p>Interesting stuff! I'm curious, Jason and others, what're the important look-and-behavior factors?</p>
<p>If I were to answer my own question, the first thing I'd say is, "A good bookmark tree is essential, and print layout sucks to read on screen; landscaped pages divided into narrow columns are miles better." But that's me, and I don't have really any serious experience doing it. What do y'all think?</p>

                            Bookmarks for sure, and in my opinion an option to toggle visibility of all the art, borders, and non-text elements (or multiple versions).  Other than that a reflowed print version that scales nicely to 8.5 x 11 or (if you want to be inclusive) A4.  Shreyas, I hadn't considered landscaping the whole book but now I will.<br/><br/>I think we'll get better at planning ahead for these features, but with The Roach we don't have too many incorporated currently.                        </div>

                            One of my favorite topics, if you read my reviews at rpgnow.com. :)<br/>
<br/>
The requirements of printer-friendliness and screen-friendliness are very different.  A PDF that is used on a laptop or PDA at the gaming table can benefit greatly from hypertext links to related segments. One that's printed out just has a lot of silly-looking underlining. A printer-friendly PDF has the page numbers at the bottom of the page and they may not match the page numbers of the PDF file itself. A screen-friendly PDF can also take advantage of mouse-over notes to remind people about one thing or another. With a screen PDF, you are basically building a gaming tool, not just organizing a text.                        </div>

                            One thing I hate is 'print-to-digital' versions of games that have print precedence. This is most obvious if    I have a file with two-column portratit  layout, and copying a single paragrpah is not possible because the copy action is not constrained by column borders. As you can see, I also like to copy text from the game for easier reference.<br/>
<br/>
I have yet to encounter an officially built pdf form for character sheets (my hand writing is that bad), ideally with a means to atomate those steps of character creation that  can be automated. In a similar vein, I'd wish for GM assistance by the product (if a GM is part of the game).<br/>
<br/>
I'd also love to see layered maps of anything mapped so that it has 'god mode' with all information and 'world view', i.e., a plain but visually appealing version. This certainly points into JD's notion of a gaming tool.<br/>
<br/>
Fulltext indexing, linked tables of contents/images/etc. also should be helpful. Of course this is all a lot of stuff to get right, but I'd be happy to pay as much for a PDF that does all this as for a book product.                        </div>

                            Our pdf experiences at 16CBH<br/>
<br/>
When we first published Battleaxe in September of 2004, it was our goal to provide a high quality pdf designed to be read and used digitally. That meant a horizontal format, large font size, integrated navigation such as hyperlinks, and a full color, screen-res presentation. I thought the first product looked good, and I was surprised when we received a near endless stream of complaints about the format. Ã¢â‚¬Å“WhereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the printer-friendly version?Ã¢â‚¬Â was the most asked question. <br/>
<br/>
So, we produced a printer-friendly version of the core rules and had two versions Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the screen formatted version and the printer-friendly version. As we made version changes or added content, keeping up with both the screen version and the printer version became a nightmare. Each version used different page sizes (of course) and different art and paragraph styles. Tracking page number revisions was difficult and releasing single page updates became almost impossible. Referencing rules by page number was clumsy, and our readers seemed confused by the two versions.  Additionally, there was not a visual consistency between the two products. But, we saw a huge spike in downloads and the print version download count always doubled that of the screen version.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, we scrapped the screen version for an 8.5x11 format pdf. We started with a simple black and white version, but, lacking interior art, that format was just too bland. We started building hires color versions of the 8.5x11 pdf and, soon, the bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s file size bloated beyond the point of what we considered reasonable. Our most current version is a monster download and not at all what we want to represent our game.  <br/>
<br/>
So, now weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re back to producing two versions. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re preparing a screen version and a print compilation of all our books that weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to offer through Lulu. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve changed the way we prep our layout so that it is more streamlined and each layout pulls from a single source. Hopefully, this next version wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t cause too many headaches. <br/>
<br/>
After having started with a strong belief that pdfs should be formatted for digital consumption and then changing our vision and moving away from that belief, we have come full circle and believe more than ever that a pdf-based game should be delivered for the computer screen.                        </div>

<p>Thanks for your thoughts and experiences, everyone! Doug, I'd be interested in the details of how you connected two layouts to one source. That sounds like an invaluable technique for those of us who would distribute print-friendly and screen documents.</p>
<p>I realise I am about to hijack my own thread. Please forgive!</p>
<p><em>What about file formats that create fluid layouts, such as HTML? Often I am frustrated by the various flaws of PDF screen reading, including the slowness of viewers reading large documents, jerky scrolling, layouts that <strong>hate</strong> text-zooming, etc. etc. Have you ever considered making a fluid screen-reading document?</em></p>

ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been mostly an internal reorganization and a rethinking of the way we build a game. See, Donald Olson and I work in two different states passing documents back and forth via email. We changed that by setting up a centralized doc we can both access via ftp. That way, we can both work separately and keep our stuff in a single working doc for each project. The layouts pull from these docs and update nearly automatically whenever those docs aremodified We created style sheets in Word that jive with our style sheets in Indesign to minimize reworking. This way, we can open the Indesign doc and know it is current because we know that all of our most current data is stored in a single Word doc. This is working great right now where weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got three RPGs in production and layout design and page sizes changing frequently as we decide how we want each game to look, etc.                        </div>

<p>I personally think the idea of laying out a document in clean HTML is a great idea. I think there is a point at which its harder to get an on-screen HTML to look like a highly designed PDF, but many games don't go to that point in any case.</p>

Well, given that TeX comes from a scientific community, and we know they're all prone to telepathic vermin, we know now the roach is secretly trying to subvert the mathematicians by hiding sumerian commands in TeX macros....                        </div>

<p>You edit text in a Markdown-like way, then export it as HTML, LaTeX, plaintext, or SGML. You can then import the HTML into OpenOffice, add styles and save for a fancy HTML, then save as an OpenOffice document.</p>

                            Oh, duh, I just refreshed my memory on BHL, and it looks like you can specify a CSS file for your HTML right there, I never used that, so I wasn't aware of it.                        </div>

                            And I love me the CSS and XML and all that, Jason.  They're good tools.  But there's a difference between keeping content and presentation separate (and manipulable) and trying to consider content without concern for presentation.  Doing the latter means that you end up with a two-hundred page treatise when you were writing it for magazine publication, or highly arcane and jargony procedures written for laymen.  Or in terms of gaming, drawing a big fat line between content and presentation gives you the index from FUDGE or the "game" strung out in an inconsistent fashion over a dozen different titles.                        </div>

                            I see madness here, but it ain't in the separation of content from presentation.  You're going to have to back up your spurious assertions with some kind of hard examples, cause this sucker ain't  buying.<br/>

I have seen the true way, and it was show to me by the Lord W3C!  Sing it with me, brothahs and sistahs!  And on his right side, huh!  On his right side sat X, yes I said X-huh! XHTML-huh!

And XHTML and CSS-uh, they took-uh me by the hands-uh, and they led my peace and tranquility-uh, I said Peace! And! Tranquility! Bruthuhs and sistahs, raise up your hands-uh!  And I bowed my head low, and I put my hands to the holy editor V! I! I said V! I! I said vi!  And I wrote the Word, and I Laid it Out!  And it was good-uh!

                            "I asked RPGnet":http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?p=5675903#post5675903 and what I gleaned is that electronic versions of games are:<br/>
<br/>
* For some people, the games are primarily printed out, then used, so optimize for that (probably PDF)<br/>
* For some people, the games are primarily read on a computer, so optimize for that (perhaps HTML)<br/>
<br/>
And my _guess_ is that someone who primarily does one of these does not do the other! So perhaps you ideally have a PDF geared towards being printed, and some other format (PDF, HTML, or otherwise) that is geared towards screen reading. Assuming you have the time to do it both ways...                        </div>

                            Ideally a PDF game is formatted so that is can be used well for both generally. Laying out everything twice, for most small publishers, is wasteful and costly for no real benefit.<br/><br/>The major opportunity that 100% of current PDF developers miss is the ability to embed data and links. Every PDF game should have an interactive character sheet, links to all kinds of source material, and interactive forms (if the game uses forms). Only then will the PDF game EXCEED the sales of paper games.                        </div>
