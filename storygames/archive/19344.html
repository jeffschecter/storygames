Sort of</b><br/>I'm heading home from Knutpunkt 2014 and I feel grateful. Partly because the prospect of taking a nap in my own bed is getting closer, but mostly because what happened at Knutpunkt make me feel grateful.<br/><br/>I was worried I would feel lost. Lost in the discourse, lost in the social structures, and that I would feel lost at the parties. But soon I felt at home. I felt at home with the people I connected or reconnected with, at home in all the awesome the discussions and felt at home doing danceoke and I felt at home in the sauna )Of course. I'm from the north). And I felt home at the panels, workshops, larps and round table discussions.<br/><br/>I also feel grateful for all the gaming communities I'm a part of. NordNordOst/NorthNorthEast, Gaming as Women, Rollspel.nu, Story Games, my local larp and tabletop scene, different gaming communities on Facebook and G+.<br/><br/>Knutpunkt for me as a time and place where a lot of different gaming communities came together at the same place in time and space. I'm grateful for what I could bring from my gaming communities to Knutpunkt, and I'm grateful for what I will be able to take with me home from Knutpunkt to the gaming communities I'm part of.<br/><br/>And I'm a bit overwhelm by all the people I met, the things done and possible Knutpunkt plague that I might be carrying.<br/><br/>I'll write an actual report of the things I did and learned later.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%23knutpunkt&amp;Mode=like">#knutpunkt</a> #knutpunkt2014\ufeff"<br/><br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>"<b>Knutpunkt - Playful and Serious</b><br/>Time for a more serious Knutpunkt review.  What's Knutpunkt? \u201cKnutepunkt is an annual conference on nordic style larp which has been running since the first event in Norway in 1997. It cycles through each of the nordic countries as hosts; in Sweden it's called Knutpunkt, in Denmark Knudepunktand in Finland Solmukohta. In English the translation would be meeting point or nodal point. \u201c <a href="http://nordiclarp.org/wiki/Knutepunkt" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://nordiclarp.org/wiki/Knutepunkt</a><br/><br/>For me this was my first Knutpunkt. I been wanting to go for years, but things kept getting in the way. Until this year. Knutpunkt has quite a reputation, or a legend perhaps, for being everything from being fantastic and magical to pretentious and elitist.<br/><br/>I hoped for the first, feared that it might be the latter. But for me, it was pretty much all I hoped for. But a lot more playful. I been to a bunch of different kind of gaming conventions and what made Knutpunkt stand out for me was how playful and serious it was.<br/><br/>It is a place where play gets taken very seriously and where serious subjects are investigated trough play. And of course there was playfullness that was just playful, and serious stuff that was seriously examined. But most things was a mix of both with some crazy creativity added on top. <br/><br/>We where about 350 participants from 27 countries. Mostly larpes, but not everyone there was a larper or even a gamer. I had a wonderful talks with performance artist for example that never larpers in her life before Knutpunkt. And there was a lot of other that was non larpers. (At least when they arrived. I think I can safety say they where larpers after they left.) The mass of people was more diverse than what you find av most gaming conventions. <br/><br/>Knutpunkt also put a lot of good design into making new people feel welcome. An opening game designed to get to know new people. The whole first day was filled with events like guides for first timers, buddy systems meant to connect first timers and old timers. There was specific tables dedicated in the dining hall to get to know new people and many other sorts of effort to build community. Like the pull out a new chair rule and the bring the newcomers up to speed rule.<br/><br/>Seriously. If there is anything other gaming convention should steal from Knutpunkt it is this two rules:<br/><br/>\u201c - Pull up a new chair: try to always have an empty chair around when you\u2019re talking in groups \u2013 it makes people feel invited to join your discussion.<br/> - Welcome newcomers in a conversation and bring them up to speed on the topics raised. This refers both to specific talks and the broader discussions spanning all the years of Knutpunkt. That way it is easier for them to contribute to the discussion.\u201c<br/><br/>The convention was pretty damn set on making people feel welcome, and I did really feal welcome. More efforts was put into making sure all newcomers felt welcome then at any other gaming convention or event I been to. <br/><br/>My Knutpunkt was a mix of larps, round table discussions, workshops, presentations. All of them was very high quality, it noticed that everyone put in that little bit of extra effort to make it really good. There was also all sort of creative crazy and strange stuff going on. It not just an convetion about play, it's a convention of play. Like \u201csecret\u201d notes left lying around, with invitation to \u201csecret\u201d parties.<br/><br/>So. What did I do at Knutpunkt? I was to all the newcomer introductions and they where great. I was to a midnight torture workshop about how to in cinematic and safe way play out scenes of torture. I discussed ethics in larp writing. I larped about tolerances in the setting of a BDSM clubs introduction night. I crawled around on the floor making funny sounds in workshop about physical approaches to character creation (it sound silly. And in was in really interesting way that really educational). I tried Viewpoints Techniques developed for performance and ensemble work about heightened awareness (I cant explain it. But it was awesome. Try if you have chance to try it.) I discussed the great player safety mess. I talked about power, gender, sex and society in group discussion about portraying sex work. I entered hyper reality trough play. I tried danceoke (It's like karaoke, but with 100 people dancing along to music videos.) I made a whirlpool in jacuzzi. I listen to presentation on how to make a meaningful and coherent wider world in larp design and how to use it. I discussed cultural appropriation in games. I held a group discussion on what larp, tabletop games and other form of role playing games can learn from each other. I talked about growing with your character and boundaries. I listed to crazy mistakes people done doing larps. I laughed trough an hour of rants. I had awesome late night conversations. And... I could o on but you get the point<br/><br/>Everything was this mix of playful and serious. All the time there as amazing conversations about larp going on. With amazing people. From all over the world. With log of different perspectives. Like, even if I hadn't attended any of the events it would be worth going to just to get to know the people. Go, if you have the chance. If you don't, steal the pull out an extra chair, and bring people up to speed on the conversation rules and used it on your gaming conventions. Because they are super nice.<br/><br/>Next year Knutpunt is in Denmark. Go to it. That is my recommendation. Because I will definitively be there and I hope you will.\ufeff")                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431288/#Comment_431288" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-19T15:35:25+00:00" title="April 19, 2014  3:35PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>((I'm also impressed by Rafus endurance; not many people can party until 7 o clock in the morning and then follow that up with flawless coordination of room cleaning.

Downtime was spent being social, relaxing, getting reacquainted with various peeps. It's always good to meet familiar, friendly faces who share many of my passions.<br/><br/>I thought the atmosphere of the event seemed very positive and upbeat, despite the sometimes tense online discussions leading up to the convention. I guess there's something to be said for meeting in meatspace.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the stand-up routines at the Open Mic.<br/><br/>I enjoyed getting a small sample of mask-working at Jannick's Play the Subtext workshop. I\u2019ve only read about mask work in Johnstone\u2019s Impro book, where he vexes almost metaphysically about it. It was so interesting to see both how cool it was to watch the masks \u201ccome alive\u201d on other participants, and to wear one myself, and just go with the flow/react to impulses from myself and other players. I don\u2019t know where the magic comes from. Maybe it\u2019s something to do with knowing you look weird? \u201cAlibi\u201d? That only half your face shows, so you have to convey emotions with the mouth region, sounds and your body instead of normal facial expressions? That your field of vision is a little restricted? I don\u2019t know what kind of improv background the others had, I only have a little, but I thought it worked really, really well. Something I\u2019d like to experience again and work more with.<br/><br/>I found the cultural appropriation panel interesting, but also a little confusing. The panel approach is often a little all over the place. It seems to me one were discussing several different terms at once, and sometimes conflating terms like \u201cracism\u201d with \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d. I\u2019d like to have seen the term itself problematized (is that a word in English?) a little more.<br/><br/>I enjoyed giving a <a href="http://snarglebarf.com/2014/04/06/it-is-frequently-argued-that-games-are-supposed-to-be-fun/" rel="nofollow">rant</a> and standing on stage. It's been a while since I performed in front of an audience that big. It's definitely an adrenaline kick.<br/><br/>I loved the American rant, all of you did such a wonderful job. It was well-prepared, well-timed and well executed. <br/>I enjoyed making silly podcasts in the car to and from the convention with J\xf8rn.<br/>Juhana's "Mistakes"-presentation was hilarious.<br/><br/>It was nice to meet Mo Halkar and Elin Dalst\xe5l for the first time, people I only knew from the internet. I only had very brief chats with them, though.<br/><br/>I was grateful and happy that there was such a good selection of non-alcoholic alternatives at the bar. Also very impressed with the bar personnel, who seemed to work all the time and kept their good cheer up.<br/><br/>The social scene at night is a little difficult to get into for me when I'm not drinking. I have this project with getting enough sleep. It's a little dull. But helps keep me stable, I guess. <br/><br/>Looking over the program now, I find lots of items I wish I'd attended. Many of them ran in parallel, of course. Don't really know where all the time went. I wish I'd approached the program in a more structured way, and attended more of the many interesting things that were available.<br/><br/>Oh, well. Next year in Denmark."<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://snarglebarf.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/dungeon.jpg?w=640"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431313/#Comment_431313" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-20T07:43:21+00:00" title="April 20, 2014  7:43AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2014 7:45AM by Rafu.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I enjoyed giving a rant and standing on stage.<br/></blockquote>\nYou were awesome!
