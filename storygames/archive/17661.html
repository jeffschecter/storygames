Particularly the interaction between these paragraphs:\n<blockquote>If the harm is generalized, like falling into a pit, losing the HP is probably all there is to it. When the harm is specific, like an orc pulling your arm from its socket, HP should be part of the effect but not the entirety of it. The bigger issue is dealing with the newly busted arm: how do you swing a sword or cast a spell?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Debilities don\u2019t replace descriptions and using the established fiction. When someone loses an arm that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re Weak, it means they have one less arm.</blockquote>\nIt seems like this says that even when HP loss has a major fictional effect, the mechanics don't really do anything to reflect what's happening. Like, the loss of that arm doesn't affect the ability to Hack n' Slash.

When your shoulder is dislocated, you do d4 damage for Hack and Slash instead of your normal damage, until you receive 6 points of healing and rest for at least one hour."<br/><br/>Those details aren't spelled out in excruciating detail with mechanics. Instead, you establish fiction and work with what makes sense given the fiction as established.<br/><br/>Which means that once the GM has established that your arm is dislocated, you can't just say "well, I swing my sword at the orc again" and roll Hack and Slash, because that doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>Maybe you say "I slam the orc into the cave wall, leading with my shoulder, trying to pop my joint back into the socket and rough the orc up a bit in the process." And when you roll well, maybe the GM determines that you resolve the shoulder thing (but still have, perhaps, Weak for a while cause it's sore) and do 2 points of damage. Because that makes sense, given the fiction as established.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian" title="Zelbinian"><img alt="Zelbinian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/056/nMYJBWP65457Z.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian">Zelbinian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399956/#Comment_399956" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-07T09:43:31+00:00" title="December  7, 2012  9:43AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 7, 2012 9:43AM by Zelbinian.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>There's no specific mechanic for "When you fail a Defy Danger roll during combat, a monster can dislocate your shoulder.

But I'm not asking for <strong>that</strong>. What I'm asking is, let's say the PC is down from 14 HP to 4 HP... I don't see where it enables the GM or the system to say "Hey. You're hurt. You can sit down and take a breather (and, of course, let the princess die), or you can forge ahead, but life is gonna suck a little more." Burning Wheel and raw Apocalypse World don't minutely detail any particular injuries, but there's a point where your injuries just make it harder to do things. It's simple mechanical feedback that makes getting hurt actually hurt. The way it's written above, it seems like as a GM I'd have to make lists of all the fiction-affecting injuries the players get and double check it every time someone tries to take an action. Is that your experience in play or am I hand-wringing over nothing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399957/#Comment_399957" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-07T09:52:50+00:00" title="December  7, 2012  9:52AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 7, 2012 9:53AM by Johnstone.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not the loss of HP that allows the GM to say that, it's the fiction. If your character goes from 20 hp down to 3 hp after fighting some dudes, the GM can say "you're starting to feel faint from loss of blood. Are you going to do something about that?" And if you don't do something about it, then maybe you have to defy danger to not pass out.<br/><br/>But this isn't because you are at 3 hp. If you're at 3 hp it's probably because you got stabbed a bunch of times, and if you got stabbed a bunch of times, you're probably bleeding, and if you're bleeding all over the place, well... it makes sense you'd pass out at some point, so that's an obvious hard move for the GM.<br/><br/>Unless it's not obvious. If nobody remembers what injuries the characters have, then obviously they're not very important. If nobody cares, move on to other stuff. Or make up a new injury that the character didn't notice before because of adrenaline and tell them to deal with it, and consider whatever else happened to be inconsequential wounds.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian" title="Zelbinian"><img alt="Zelbinian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/056/nMYJBWP65457Z.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian">Zelbinian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399959/#Comment_399959" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-07T10:05:57+00:00" title="December  7, 2012 10:05AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm... just not getting it.

Yes, clearly by ripping their arm out of their socket you've hinted that it's probably not a good idea, but... what if they tried it? What if continuing to fight was Very Important? He's... fending off the orcs so his wizard friend will have time to cast the spell to Save the Universe or something. This is the kind of dilemma that I, as a story gaming GM, love to put my players in. So what happens if he tried to Hack N' Slash anyway? Does he just roll Hack N' Slash as normal?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399971/#Comment_399971" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-07T11:11:46+00:00" title="December  7, 2012 11:11AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah there is. <br/><br/>Hack and Slash<br/><b>When you attack an enemy in melee</b>, roll+Str.\n<blockquote><br/>GM: "The grey render grabs your arm as you swing and, like it's nothing, pops it out of your socket.

When you CAN'T attack someone in melee (the condition for the move to work) you can't roll the move. <br/><br/>Here the longer Dungeon World rule text p16\n<blockquote><br/>A character can\u2019t take the fictional action that triggers a move without that move occurring.

In AW - which is what I expected the damage system to look like, if you're looking to gauge my frame of mind - if your arm is out of it's socket, you're well on your way to 9 o'clock. In fact, as a GM I'd only suggest that if the damage you took was sufficient enough to warrant it. <br/>- And in that case, AW has built into it the price of continuing to fight: your harm is going to skyrocket until you're dead. You can keep attacking if you want, but it's up to you to make the hard choice. I don't see the equivalent in DW.<br/><br/>I am now going to apologize for accidentally shitting on your game, sage. Wasn't my intention. Just because I'm having difficulties with some of it doesn't mean I don't appreciate the hard work that went into making it and that I still won't have fun playing it.

It's counterintuitive that there is a number counting down to character death that only has a casual (if any) relationship to the physical condition of the character in the fiction. But, mechanically, that's how it seems to work. In our DW games, we decided that the loss of HP did not equal the loss of "health" or "life force" or "blood" or whatever; loss of HP just meant: "an increased likelihood that the next bad thing will result in death." <br/><br/>So, in that sense, a character could roll a 6 and lose 8 HP without getting physically stabbed or clubbed or whatever -- the loss of 8 HP could have represented that the character was "shaken" or "off her game," and, therefore, more susceptible to leaving herself open to a deathblow. The converse was true too, if a character lost HP because he "lost an arm" that character might heal the HP, but the arm is still gone . . .   <br/><br/>I think it's useful to distinguish between the loss of HP and the fictional harms. When a GM reduces a character's HP, that means that, according to the mechanics of DW, the GM has raised the difficulty of getting out of the immediate dangerous situation alive, and thus the player might make decisions with the increased possibility of death in mind. If the GM causes a fictional harm, it means that the character has to react to the new fictional situation just like every other fictional situation the GM presents. <br/><br/>Anyway, that worked for us.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian" title="Zelbinian"><img alt="Zelbinian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/056/nMYJBWP65457Z.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian">Zelbinian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399990/#Comment_399990" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-07T12:23:44+00:00" title="December  7, 2012 12:23PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 7, 2012 12:31PM by Zelbinian.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You're right that it doesn't affect the mechanics in a consistent way.

Like I said, the loose coupling was throwing me for a loop. I like my combat gritty!<br/><br/>Also, I like my proclamations as GM be commensurate with the what the mechanics tell me. I don't like be arbitrary. The RAW and examples were making it me hard to figure out how to adjudicate some situations. Like, losing 6 HP... is that a big deal? Maybe? I guess it depends on how many they had to begin with and how much they have left and how much armor they had. (I say again: hit points make me have a sad.) If it <i>was</i> a big deal and you failed your roll and the troll was wrenching you around, yup, I'm gonna dislocate your arm... if it matters. I mean, if I do that and then you can keep on fighting like nothing's happening just because you haven't hit 0 yet, well then instead of breaking your arm I'm gonna throw your sword across the cave, because that makes you have to deal with something. In AW what I do a lot is make people Act Under Fire to do things after they take a decent hit. (I suppose this is approximating the Steel rules in Burning Wheel, though I only just now realized that's what I'm doing!) But I'm allowed to do that! The book says so! I can make as hard and direct a move as I like, and that's one of my moves! Here I'm like... well, Defy Danger is almost that... but not really so... what do I do to make that injury feel real and also not be an arbitrary dick? The RAW further distancing the conditions from the hit points made me wonder when the hell you applied those so... thanks for filling that gap. I think I'm ok now. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote>First, I agree that HP is weird.

Plus, Zelby, DW uses AW's engine, principles and moves sure, but it also takes many tropes and icons from D&amp;D. So to claim dissapointment when the combat is not as 'gritty' as AW, stating that it is 'Heroic' without taking a little time to read what the focus of the game is may be a little contrite no? Its NOT AW with elves and orcs and magic. Its NOT about scarcity / want / need and human misery and there being no status Quo. Its about:\n<blockquote>Dungeon World is a world of fantastic adventure. A world of magic, gods and demons, of good and evil, law and chaos. Brave heroes venture into the most dangerous corners of the land in search of gold and glory....<br/>Why play Dungeon World? <b><i>First, to see the characters do amazing things</i></b>. To see them explore the unexplored, slay the undying, and go from the deepest bowels of the world to the highest peaks of the heavens. To see them caught up in momentous events and grand tragedies. Second, to see them struggle together. To gather as a party despite their differences and stand united against their foes. Third, because the world still has so many places to explore. There are unlooted tombs and dragon hoards dotting the countryside just waiting for quick-fingered and strong-armed adventurers to discover them.</blockquote>\nThis infuses the combat too. It is HEROIC. Make it gritty if you want, establish far more narrative consequences instead of rolling HP damage (or in addition too).  Hit the characters with debilities. Mechanical effects are far less effecting than well described narrative ones.

I mean, PC's in AW are bad asses and definitely do amazing things. Plus there's the "Second, to see them struggle together." It is totally possible to read that introduction as "This will be dungeon delving, but with that AW feel." I play a lot of Apocalypse World but haven't touched D&amp;D in over a decade; that's just where my head is at. Add in the fact that people tend to say things like "I like the * World games" makes it easy to confuse them as being of-a-piece, not that the developers can do anything about that.

It's too easy for it to become divorced from the fiction (see also: Barter). DW doesn't really solve this problem and, in some ways, exacerbates it slightly by making it more granular (i.e. you can generally take more HP damage than you can take Harm). In both cases, you can overcome this problem by emphasizing the fiction that goes with HP loss or Harm, but it takes additional effort and mindspace on the part of the GM that I would prefer to spend on something else. There have been a number of proposed custom moves for connecting Harm more closely with the fiction, and I'd love to see more people give that a shot, because I think it might improve AW hacks in general.<br/><br/>I don't think it's DW's "fault" or anything that it didn't "fix" harm. One of the principles behind DW's design was to have it be understandable and semi-familiar to folks who were used to playing D&amp;D, so having a HP-based system makes sense. Also, if you're playing in a semi-OSR style where the fiction matters some but, really, the characters are mostly avatars through which the players explore hazardous fantasy environments and probably die (see also: World of Dungeons), then measuring things in HP seems fine. But if you really want a gritty Burning Wheel-style thing where being ill or bleeding or injured matters a great deal (and you can be less ill/injured or more ill/injured), I think you may ultimately want mechanics that bring in that fictional context more. So... custom move?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400060/#Comment_400060" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-07T21:24:00+00:00" title="December  7, 2012  9:24PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 7, 2012 9:26PM by Paul_T.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I very much agree that AW harm is one of the less-interesting bits of the system, and unfortunately it gets carried into all sorts of hacks (like Monsterhearts) which, in my opinion, would benefit from a very different approach to physical damage.<br/><br/>I've been working on a variant harm move for AW; a more gritty and visceral sort of approach to getting hurt.

I find this oddly jarring in a game full of invokable story cues like conditions, tags and move choices. So I use physical counters to rectify this, the players each have a bunch of heart shaped red glass tokens. I tell them that once their last token is gone, their heart stops and they have to face death's dark gates. I also give out conditions all the time, prescriptively following the narrative description. I mean debilities are the obvious choice here. But I use others as the situation deems suitable. The players write the tag down on a post-it and stick it to the top of their character sheet.<br/><br/>Cleric fails his prayer roll to turn undead? Well, I could have the zombies gnaw into him or his friend's HP, but I would probably say they are terrified! I will invoke that tag (usually requiring a defy danger move) until they manage to revoke it; as I am a fan, but I also like putting the players in a spot.</blockquote>\nI like that. Feels very Lady Blackbird and it has that consequences matter feel to it. But, again, I can't tell if that's RAW or a drift. It seems like the latter because if the game intended for you to be able to paste a PC with any tag you wanted, probably there wouldn't be a predefined list on the character sheet?<br/><br/>I also have a question about whether fighting is the only way to resolve a conflict, but that sounds like another thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

It might be neat to make a hack where this idea is expanded to other moves.

Specifically that the cloud portion of the harm is different and totally disconnected from the mechanical in-system harm tracking and reduction mechanics.  For example, if I cut off Hooch's arm with my machete (3 harm) and he then later heals the harm away, he's still down an arm.  This is because while taking harm (me cutting off his arm) is both a cloud and system event, him regaining that harm is purely fiddling around with some numbers in system land and has no real connection to the state his arm is in.  <br/><br/>Similarly in Dungeon World, a blow that does less mechanical damage (removes fewer HP) but more in-ficion trauma can perfectly coexist with another blow that does more mechanical and less fictional damage as descriptive injuries are the in-game consequences of getting hurt and that hitpoints are purely tracking mechanics to death.  I'm personally of the opinion that all games that have health tracking that is totally (or at least mostly) disconnected from any other in-game effects (examples: AW, D&amp;D, nWoD, Feng Shui) work in the same way of divorcing fictional injury from system damage tracking and need some in-game description attached to the damage event in order to make the damage mean anything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cathexis" title="cathexis"><img alt="cathexis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cathexis">cathexis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401271/#Comment_401271" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-19T17:43:16+00:00" title="December 19, 2012  5:43PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 19, 2012 5:45PM by cathexis.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a slight aside, in Apocalypse World, it's not fair for the MC to deal (say) four harm without any description and then make me act under fire when trying to run away due to my injuries because that MC call is a purely cloud-based statement and nothing has been established within our fictional space that would block me from running.  On the flip side, if I have my leg cut off but have been healed back up to full health, the MC is fully within their right to make me act under fire because running is hard with a peg leg because there's an established fictional reason why I can't run.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401275/#Comment_401275" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-19T20:43:57+00:00" title="December 19, 2012  8:43PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            cathexis,<br/><br/>We've been having quite a discussion about this issue in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17665/apocalypse-world-a-more-descriptivevisceral-approach-to-harm" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> I started.<br/><br/>As for this discussion, I'm toying with the idea of using the harm system from that thread with the option to burn hit points for a bonus to the roll.
