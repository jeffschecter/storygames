Some people are mistaking simple failure in a conflict with "whiffing."  I wanted to point out that there's a difference here.<br/><br/>"Whiffing" requires absolutely no change at all.  When you fail a To Hit roll in a combat round of D&amp;D (don't know about 4e) literally nothing changes.  You get another To Hit roll on another round.  Similarly systems along these lines talk about re-rolls.  If you don't pick the lock and there is nothing pressing you can simply re-roll.  In theory all that's happening is time is passing.  You just try and try and try until you succeed or give up or the GM rules that so much time has passed that something happens.<br/><br/>That's not true in say, Sorcerer.  If you're interrogating Jones and you fail.  That's it.  Interrogation WILL NOT WORK, period.  The game assumes you gave the interrogation your all and there's nothing left.  This is not a "Whiff" because the situation has changed.  A whole line of action and decisions is now cut off.  You do not have to change your *agenda*.  You can still be fully committed to getting the information out of Jones but interrogation is no longer an option.<br/><br/>This is less apparent when you break things down a little bit. For example, you might threaten Jone's life and you fail.  You could continue to "interrogate" but you'd have to change your approach.  Threatening Jone's life won't work.  The situation changes.  Jones is willing to die (or at least call your bluff), period.  So you try threatening his family, that would be worth another roll.  <br/><br/>People seem to discount this "cutting off of approaches" as "a change in the situation."<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176752/#Comment_176752" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-29T20:59:07+00:00" title="October 29, 2008  8:59PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>When you fail a To Hit roll in a combat round of D&amp;D (don't know about 4e) literally nothing changes.

If a player goes, "Hm...my character MIGHT know this...it's not her field but it's pretty close." and a GM goes "Make a Knowledge check." and the player goes "12" and the GM goes, "You don't know anything about the subject." then it is not whiffing, even though the situation has not changed at all, and indeed, the only fact we've introduced into the game world is negative - the character doesn't know something. "Whiffing" is a grouchy way of saying "frustrating failure".  If the situation changes in a frustrating way, the mere fact that the situation has changed may make the "whiffing" worse rather than better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176779/#Comment_176779" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-30T07:30:48+00:00" title="October 30, 2008  7:30AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Um, no, something changes, because the other guy now gets a chance at you that, if you had taken him out, he wouldn't have had.</blockquote>\nTrue, in the tactical sense. But it doesn't change the fact that in skill/attack rolls, when the result is usually "you hit" and "you miss", that smell of "nothing has changed" is choking. I love D&amp;D 4e, and even I feel it a lot (even thought I know the other guy is getting a chance on my failure, and I his). You can always use description and narration tricks to lessen the blow, but still there's that feel of "whiff" or "nothing has changed" in rolls where the result is a pure binary 1 or 0: Success or Fail, nothing in between.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>"Whiffing" is a grouchy way of saying "frustrating failure".</blockquote>\nThis is correct.<br/><br/>Was going to write more, sorry, but I've got a belly full of sake and can barely complete this sentence.

PCs swing and miss, enemies swing a miss. PCs maybe move a little, swing and miss, NPCs swing and miss.... Frustration. <br/><br/>I also had a A Dirty World game last night where the PC in a scene tied with the NPC like four rolls in a row (statistically improbable, but it happened). It really was just a long series of characters bouncing off of each other with little changing. However, the difference was that in A Dirty World we knew how to integrate it into the fiction better, so that the fact that these two characters couldn't change each other became part of the fun of the game, rather than a frustration. So, in some ways, despite the fact that the system changed little to nothing, the fiction did change as a result. <br/><br/>That, for me, is where the difference between failing and wiffing comes in. When failure, of any kind, becomes frustrating and blocking, it's "wiffing." When failure leads to more tension or something interesting, it isn't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176791/#Comment_176791" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-30T10:04:39+00:00" title="October 30, 2008 10:04AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's "nothing has changed" in the sense that there's no difference between failure, and not attempting the action in the first place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176806/#Comment_176806" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-30T11:43:48+00:00" title="October 30, 2008 11:43AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps there's room here for a "double whiff" i.e. a round with no contact or change, i.e. "wasted time" to have an immediate narrative impact.

A first level D&amp;D; character failing to hit a Red Dragon, isn't a whiff...it was just a stupid attack.  A Pendragon Knight failing to hit a peasant 3 times in a row because BRP puts pretty low odds on success...even for things you're supposed to be good at...may well be a whiff.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond is the roll's effect on the dramatic tension.  Here I'm not talking about hippy Drama resolution stuff...I'm talking about whatever it is in your game that gets you wide eyed on the edge of your seat.  If a failure increases Dramatic Tension, its not a whiff.  If a failure decreases Dramatic Tension it may well be.  Dramatic Tension can be decreased for a variety of reasons.  The classic example is the anti climax.   This can happen alot in games like D&amp;D; when you know the enemy is defeated, and it just becomes a question of which player isn't going flub their to-hit roll and land the killing blow.<br/>\n<br/>\nTime passing is an interesting deal.  Sometimes the passing of time helps ramp up Dramatic Tension.  You've got 12 rounds to save the prisoner, its going to take at least 8 to execute the plan.  You've got 4 rounds to spare...and you just failed your lock picking roll...a roll that your character normally makes in their sleep.  That can definitely ramp up Dramatic Tension (although its been used so much in movies and TVs to be a bit cliche at this point).<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, sometimes Time Passing is not dramatic at all.  Its just resource management.  Resource management can be tactically interesting and a source of great fun, but only sometimes is it dramatic.  I'm a skilled fighter, due to a flubbed die roll I fail to kill the last kobold.  That last kobold gets a final attack which does 7 points of damage to me reducing my Hit Points to 57.  Sure...one can imagine that at some point in the future, I may be regretting those 7 hitpoints.  Those 7 Hitpoints might be an extra Cure Light or Potion of Healing.  It might mean we only have the resources to go 3 more fights before returning to town instead of 4.  So its clearly not a case of "nothing happens".  But its also not in any way dramatic or tense.  Its just a whiff.<br/>\n<br/>\nGames that are whiff prone then are those that provide a high chance of failure to competent characters acting within their area of expertise (like BRP, or D&amp;D2nd;), and that don't provide any mechanical rules for using failure to ramp up tension after the fact.<br/>\n<br/>\nGames that are largely immune to whiffage are those in which it is very unlikely for a character to fail in their area of expertise, or where the player is given some ability to control when they fail or when they don't.  TSOY's Bringing Down the Pain works well to combat whiffage as does SotC Compells in which players can choose to failure for a reward...and then (if memory serves) use that reward to avoid failing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso games which allow for random failures, but then empower the players to twist the knife in some way to make that failure dramatically interesting can dodge whiffing problems.  IaWA does this with the Stick and Negotiations.  Failure is painfully easy in that game...the number of times I've had overwhelming dice and still lost is embarrassing.  But rare is the time I can't negotiate an outcome from the failure that is at least as entertaining as the success I'd envisioned.  Polaris is another good example, where the string of But Only Ifs and Furthermores pretty much guarentee that SOMETHING interesting is going to happen (and pretty much guarentee that you'll be hard put to figure out who actually "won")                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176827/#Comment_176827" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-30T16:58:21+00:00" title="October 30, 2008  4:58PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seems a pretty good summary, I would emphasize that if you are after the thrills and satisfaction of resource management, your expectation changes your level of frustration. It's right that it's not dramatic that the kobold got in that last hit on our fighter fella in any sense of the word dramatic. But it can be significant. I don't see it as a whiff in that case, because I am mumbling and writing things down and adjusting our plans and making decisions afterwards, not just sitting there going "well that was dumb."  But if you're not after resource management or don't care about it, then yeah, there's no there there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176920/#Comment_176920" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-31T14:00:52+00:00" title="October 31, 2008  2:00PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a little detail here that is also important, and that's the word "whiff" itself.

Which is pretty shameful -- real golfers don't whiff.<br><br>The way that Ron talks about whiffing in <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i> also suggests this to me, where he talks about how, in some games, if you fail your attack roll then your sword goes "whiff," contacting nothing but air.  But if you're a badass barbarian, that shouldn't happen.  Badass barbarians don't whiff.  Their attacks might be parried or blocked or dodged by a centimeter, but they don't just plain-vanilla <i>miss</i>.<br><br>(To be fair, when D&amp;D says "miss" it actually means "fail to inflict damage," which is why armor makes you harder to "hit" -- but there's a lot of people who don't catch that)<br><br>So, I think whiffiness also has to do with what failure <i>looks</i> like.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176921/#Comment_176921" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-31T14:09:40+00:00" title="October 31, 2008  2:09PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been thinking about how to respond to this.  To somewhat agree with the "frustration" point (I don't really like that distinction) I really don't think "missing" in D&amp;D is all that big a deal because I'm generally not focused on the actual choreography of the fight.  So, rolling and missing can be a big deal especially if you really needed that hit.  And then there is the wider scope of resource management which can be a source of fun as well.<br><br>It's why I say that I think task resolution works best in tactical focused situations where there's a lot of pre-planning involved in terms of the "terrain" (where terrain here includes all obstacles to a goal).  So if you're playing some kind of espionage game and you're breaking into some kind of facility and the GM knows where all the cameras are, and how many guards there are and what their patrol routes are and how long it takes.... then whether it takes you one roll or four rolls to pick that lock can be the difference between whether there are or aren't guards on the other side.<br><br>That can be interesting.<br><br>Jesse                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176952/#Comment_176952" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-31T23:17:17+00:00" title="October 31, 2008 11:17PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If there's a better way to define what I'm talking about than "frustration", I'm all for it, I just can't think of anything better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176975/#Comment_176975" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-01T10:07:02+00:00" title="November  1, 2008 10:07AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 1, 2008 10:07AM by Judd.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>If there's a better way to define what I'm talking about than "frustration", I'm all for it, I just can't think of anything better.</blockquote>\nI can't think of a better word for it.

I have a professor of languages in Call of Cthulhu with an 80% which makes me world renown in my field yet I can have failed to make a Latin language roll 6 times in a row. At that point, not only has very little changed, there is no dramatic failure to at least have the failure fuel the story, but I've also deprotagonized my character. What makes my character cool is now useless and in the fiction I'm essentially a clown. <br><br/>What's worse, in games like D&amp;D 4E, at higher levels combats take so long that you may only be able to participate every 20 minutes. Which means in a session, you may only roll to attack 10 or so times. Generally from what I've seen, our general level of success has been 50-40%. So out of your 10 times to participate in a night of gaming, you accomplish very little for half of it. So now you only succeed an average of 5 times. Throw in conditions where you have negatives to hit, can only attack or move, have your move reduced to 2, and the unpredictability of a flat probability d20... I've seen many sessions where someone was only able to meaningfully participate 3 times. <br/><br/>Strangely enough this becomes an amazing motivator to min max and scratch and claw for every single bonus you can get away with. Your ability to impact the game depends on it! I know many people who just stop playing. Although to be fair there is lots of fun to be had in combat when it is isn't your turn. Watching others act. Planning actions with your friends. And just the tension of getting to roll the dice can be exciting. <br/><br/>I know some people complain that gamers make crappy stories because they make poor protagonists in the sense of making characters with no weaknesses or avoiding caring about things for fear of being exploited (desires, wants, relationships). But if you've been trained in the style of play I describe above where you sit there for 4 hours doing very little unless you min max the hell out of every situation, I can imagine how several years of this style of play would form these habits.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176991/#Comment_176991" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-01T12:01:10+00:00" title="November  1, 2008 12:01PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After thinking about it more I think my only issue is that I don't like "frustration" being part of the definition of whiffing.

Must be because I'm the GM most of the time. Do GMs suffer from whiffing? I suspect not, as the GM usually runs the procedures of play and therefore will by default appreciate each step individually as the precious snowflake that it is.<br/><br/>I have, however, one play experience that very clearly whiffed, the time I played 4th ed. D&amp;D with my brothers last summer. Interestingly enough, I could instantly recognize the combination of boredom and desperation when I rolled the die cheekily, with a relaxed wrist movement and utter disinterest in what it meant. "This is whiffing", I said to myself. At that time it seemed to pertain to the overall insignificance of each individual die roll: there was no choice involved in whether to roll or not, and success or failure of the roll did nothing in the fiction, either: the difference was solely in whether some points would be deducted from the GM's hitpoint tallies. I wouldn't try to explain this in terms of the technical situation, really, as similar mechanics are quite capable of not whiffing when the reward cycles are running correctly and the player is actually interested in the dicing results. Whiffing is attitude, in other words.<br/><br/>That was kinda sucky, I have to admit. I have had a pretty good play history (read: mediocre instead of catastrophic) compared to how people bitch here in the Internet, but that particular fight was worthy of complaint, I guess. The only other time that has come close this decade was when I played Vampire for one session last winter, but that wasn't so much die related... although the boredom and the need to self-trepanate myself to relieve it was kinda similar. Do you need dice to whiff, or can you whiff solely because the GM is utterly boring?<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Hey, what am I talking about? Of course I've had whiff, and quite recently, too: last week, <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26927.0" rel="nofollow">this session of Poison'd right here!</a> I didn't realize the appropriate English-language terminology when writing that description, but thinking back on it, there surely were some elements of whiffing in those endless batches of dice rolling that are necessary to pirate a prize and get some loot. I was the GM, too, so I guess the GM can suffer from whiffage just as anybody else when he hasn't fully internalized and accepted the system he practices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177033/#Comment_177033" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-01T22:56:19+00:00" title="November  1, 2008 10:56PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never seen the term whiffing used in anything other than a negative context as being an irritation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere doesn't seem much point to "whiff" as a synonym for "fail" or "miss".<br/>\n<br/>\nI've seen people say they've enjoyed a failure.

If my concept is a badass barbarian dude, and I roll to hit and flatly miss, that's not very badass.  It's a whiff.<br/><br/>If my concept is a hapless potboy pulled in to adventures against his better judgement, that same miss is not a whiff, concept is intact, now I have the fear of having left myself open to my opponent's counterattack.<br/><br/>Whiffing in large part comes about in my view not because of system, but because of a mismatch of system and player expectation.  BRP assumes mortal, fallible protagonists.  Players often expect a more cinematic reality than the system is designed to deliver.  The gap between the game's intent and the player's expectation is where you find the whiff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177681/#Comment_177681" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-07T09:28:44+00:00" title="November  7, 2008  9:28AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and whiffing to me definitely implies frustration.

I especially ask this because, it seems to me, the urge to be concise is often at direct odds with the need to be clear. This gets proven over and over and over every time some goddamned jargon-laden theory thread starts up, or someone who's not in the tribe misuses/misinterprets a piece of jargon and the thread turns to shit because now it's all about defending the tribe's identity tools rather than, you know, talking about the issue or idea at hand.<br/><br/>Like...let's say you have a problem with a system. You and your players are bored because it seems like not much actually happens despite the fact you're rolling dice and tracking resources like mad. Yes...yes, you could reduce all that to shorthand -- whiff, for example. But guess what? Anyone who's not in on that conversation is now officially excluded from the conversation. The conversation <i>should</i> be talking about ways to address the boredom or frustration. I'll bet you hard cash that that's not where the conversation will go.<br/><br/>Really, we're not using up a rare and unreplenishable resource here. How much time have you really saved by reducing "I feel bored and/or frustrated by most of what's happening in my game" down to "I hate all the whiffing"? And what have you given up in the interest of being "concise"?<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177707/#Comment_177707" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-07T12:41:48+00:00" title="November  7, 2008 12:41PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm okay with definitional discussions because they help me work out what people mean by things.

Contrast with The Pool, where, if a player fails a roll, the GM has to narrate something bad happening as a result of the player's failure.  The Anti-Whiff.  It's great.<br/><br/>-Will                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

OH WAIT I DID HOLY SHIT I AM A GENIUS.<br/><br/>From <i>octaNe: premium uNleaded</i> (2002), pagina cinco:\n<blockquote><b>\u201cThe Whiff Factor\u201d</b><br/>If you\u2019ve ever played a role playing game before, you know how it goes: your best-of-the-best character is trying to perform some relatively easy task, you roll the dice, and you get a bad result. Whiff \u2013 the sound of your samurai\u2019s katana slicing through the empty air instead of through the mid-section of that evil sorcerer. Or your suave gentleman spy suddenly blurts out a corny pick-up line to the sexy torch singer.<br/><br/>Huh? <br/><br/>That one bad roll has turned your experienced, ultra-cool character into a super chump. Sure, the Game Moderator can fudge the roll or whatever, but the point stands: the dice made your character look like a rank amateur.<br/> <br/>But it\u2019s not all posturing and ego-gratification here, folks; the knife cuts both ways. Let\u2019s say your meek and mild accountant is attacked in some dark alley. You roll your pitiful attack score\u2026 and get a critical hit! THWAK! All of a sudden, Sheldon Smiley, CPA is Sheldon Smiley, Ninja Accountant. It doesn\u2019t fit with the character. It doesn\u2019t really make sense. It doesn\u2019t work.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178848/#Comment_178848" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-15T19:44:00+00:00" title="November 15, 2008  7:44PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Games that are whiff prone then are those that provide a high chance of failure to competent characters acting within their area of expertise (like BRP, or D&amp;D2nd), and that don't provide any mechanical rules for using failure to ramp up tension after the fact.</blockquote>\nThis is probably my biggest frustration with many games I've played. I have a professor of languages in Call of Cthulhu with an 80% which makes me world renown in my field yet I can have failed to make a Latin language roll 6 times in a row. At that point, not only has very little changed, there is no dramatic failure to at least have the failure fuel the story, but I've also deprotagonized my character. What makes my character cool is now useless and in the fiction I'm essentially a clown.Simply put, a character with that sort of language skill shouldn't have to <i>touch</i> the dice until Atlantean or Ancient Cimarian shows up. My biggest problem with modern gaming is the idea of sucking at your build focus. A game (or a GM), in my opinion, should make this impossible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178849/#Comment_178849" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-15T19:46:03+00:00" title="November 15, 2008  7:46PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jared A.
