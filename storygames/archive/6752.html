This is really really hard.<br/><br/>Basically all of the sub-systems of our game interact with each other, so we're finding it really hard to define any specific chunk of the mechanics without defining a whole bunch of other chunks (or littering the text with a lot of "see section X on page Y").<br/><br/>What sort of RPG books have you read that you thought were really well organized? How did they go about organizing things in a clear way? For other people who are/have written up a core rules RPG book how do you go about organizing things so that the rules were presented clearly, especially if there's a lot of interlocking sub-systems. Terms first? Core mechanics first? Character creation first?<br/><br/>As far as what sort of game we've cooked up, is sort of a strange bastard child of Spirit of the Century and Burning Wheel, with a lot more emphasis on what emotions the characters are feeling and mechanics that tie into those emotions than either have, will provide more details if its helpful.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149903/#Comment_149903" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T21:05:00+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  9:05PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Daztur</cite>What sort of RPG books have you read that you thought were really well organized?

The starting scenario is integrated with the rules, so that you learn while playing. So the GM/teacher would be saying things like this (mostly reading aloud from the book):<br/><br/>- "You're heroes living at the court of the queen."<br/>- "These characters are available. Pick one."<br/>- "At the yearly tournament, you get these challenges (...)"<br/>- "This is how stat-based challenges work. Roll these dice like this."<br/>- "A count approaches you with a task, but wants to see if you're up to it."<br/>- "Now we're doing skill-based challenges. Roll these dice like this."<br/><br/>etc, etc. This makes it very easy for the GM/teacher to run the game, without being afraid to forget something important along the way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daztur" title="Daztur"><img alt="Daztur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daztur">Daztur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149921/#Comment_149921" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T23:02:46+00:00" title="June 11, 2008 11:02PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matthijs: yeah, a tutorial adventure seems like a very good idea.

I'm still not sure I got it right either.<br/><br/>However I felt that there were a few basic structures in most of the books I looked at<br/><br/>(1) Background, Character Creation, Rules, Example, GM advice<br/><br/>(2) Intro, Character Creation, Rules, GM Advice, Background<br/><br/>(3) Intro, Rules, Character Creation (with example), Background, GM advice<br/><br/>And some variations of the above. The biggest questions are where does the setting stuff (if you have it) go, start or end, and what is the order or rules and character creation? Lesser questions are about whether you break the example out into it's own section (or just pepper stuff here and there), whether there is a GM advice section, or special rules in some non-core section and the like. Also do you have a glossary, if so, where does it go? I had the hardest time with that one!<br/><br/>Personally I am all about the setting, and so setting first makes sense for me, but it can be a long haul for people eager to get to the rules. In the end I went with<br/><br/>Setting, Rules overview, Glossary, Chargen, Main Rules, Example, GM Advice + Special rules<br/><br/>For Solipsist.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149958/#Comment_149958" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T05:40:59+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  5:40AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With <i>Grey Ranks</i> I had two problems - some historical background and some fiddly procedures.  I structured the book as background - procedures - resources.  The procedural stuff comprises about 60% of the total.  I worked hard to make the background stuff non-essential but still interesting to read.  I put it first because it informs the rationale behind the procedures that follow.<br/><br/>In terms of connecting text to game play and arriving at a pedagogy for readers and players, I chose to make the first part of the game essentially a tutorial - you sketch out the base details of your characters, then you play out an initial scene, then you finish your characters informed by the first chapter's events.  At that point you've had contact with every rule and are ready to engage fully.  I also structured examples of play that persisted from one to the next, telling the story of four people playing a complete game.  All the art refers to the examples of play, chapter by chapter as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149962/#Comment_149962" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T05:53:18+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  5:53AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a trick:<br/><br/>1.

So instead of leaving the order of the text implicit, add all kinds of paragraphs about how "now that I've explained this stuff, you might wish to skip over to page XX to read more about topic Z, or alternatively continue directly with topic ZZ, starting on the next page." In other words, you could leave the issue of best order up to the reader, instead of trying to arrange everything into a seamless read-through entity; after all, it's a roleplaying game rulebook, not a novel, so the reader will be reading it to learn a model of play, not to have an uniform and immersive reading experience. It's quite OK to start the book with an explanation of how it's arranged and then let the reader make his own decisions about whether he can stand to read another character about character creation before he just absolutely has to know how task resolution checks are made.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150042/#Comment_150042" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T09:27:57+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  9:27AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero: How does cross-indexing mean that you don't have to make choices about how a book is ordered?
