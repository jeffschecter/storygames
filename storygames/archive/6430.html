Usually followed by their definition of what a roleplaying game is, should be, or needs to have.<br/><br/>It's not just that the objection itself is annoyingly presumptive -- it is, though! -- or that it's not helpful.  (I mean, obviously whoever created the game, as part of Game Chef, thinks it's a game and wants it to be treated as a game.)<br/><br/>It's also that these types of definitional arguments, these fixed ideas about what makes "a roleplaying game" and what doesn't, really do prevent us from pushing the limits on roleplaying games. They drive us back into a box, in a game design event that, at its best, is about climbing out of that box.  They set boundaries on what games can and can't be -- and pile doubtful skepticism on any games which leave the roleplaying game ghetto.<br/><br/>This is why I don't ever want to hear, in a critique, "is this really a roleplaying game?"  Obviously the designer of the game thinks it is, and she wants you to engage it on that level. Your opinion doesn't matter more than hers. Put that particular question aside and never ask it.<br/><br/>It's the worst thing you can ask in a GC critique.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142388/#Comment_142388" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-05T07:34:11+00:00" title="May  5, 2008  7:34AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel you, but I'm going to disagree.  Someone questioning the <i>what </i>of your game can be really useful, because you're probably too close to be objective.  If another person looks at your game and asks "where's the role-playing?" they might just be a hidebound dick, but they might not be seeing the, you know, role-playing.  I know from experience I've had good friends ask this question of my designs and it has been helpful.<br/><br/>There are diplomatic ways to approach it, and in a forum like Game Chef nobody has any business setting boundaries for anybody else, but I don't think questioning the role-playing-ness or game-ness is in itself a bad thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142391/#Comment_142391" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-05T07:40:18+00:00" title="May  5, 2008  7:40AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're not required, by the rules of the contest, to engage your critiquers.<br/><br/>If you don't like what they have to say, I suggest -- strongly -- that you don't.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142393/#Comment_142393" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-05T07:48:22+00:00" title="May  5, 2008  7:48AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, but "Where's the role-playing in this game?" is a different critical move than "This isn't really a role-playing game." The first opens up the discussion; the second shuts it down. Now I suppose you could say that the end-result is the same: designer rethinks some aspect of the game. But it seems to me that the former criticism invites designer and critic to engage with each other in a way that's ultimately more helpful to the designer. It's not a question of "how do I respond to the charge that my game isn't an RPG" (the answer, as Ben suggests, is don't), but rather disappointment that the critique was a dead-end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142396/#Comment_142396" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-05T07:50:29+00:00" title="May  5, 2008  7:50AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2008 7:51AM by Kynn.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Questioning how the game plays, I think, is fair, Jason.

To me, it's very hard to interpret the question "but is it a role-playing game?" as anything else than "you should change your game so it fits my preconceptions", which in turn means "remove all interesting parts". <br/><br/>When I get the question "but is it a role-playing game?" these days, I say "I don't know, perhaps it really isn't?" and try to go on with my business. Trying to squeeze your game into a specific form because somebody gets in a huff over definitions is really a complete waste of time.<br/><br/>In the latest RISK competition (in Norway), my game "Three Futures" was severely criticized for not being a role-playing game. Some people had fun with it, nonetheless, and to the best of my knowledge, it ended up being one of the most-played games from that competition - seconded only by the actual winning entry, I believe.<br/><br/>What I did understand from that competition, though, was that some people took "Three Futures" as a <i>deliberate</i> provocation. Why, I don't know. It may have seemed like I was poking fun at other competitors, or breaking the rules of the competition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142402/#Comment_142402" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-05T08:02:06+00:00" title="May  5, 2008  8:02AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that the person doing the critique probably has a valid point, but the language is less than useful if all they say is "It's not a RPG." Rather, that phrase isn't illuminating. Ignore that, and look at what the person said outside of that. Like, "I don't see that much 'role-playing' will happen" (as Jason suggests). Then you have to consider if this effect is a problem or not. <br/>\n<br/>\nNote that it's always possible to get back feedback that doesn't help, because it goes against your goals. Like "It's too complex" might be proffered when, in fact, one of your goals is to have a very complex game. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo some extent, the person doing the critique can't help but bring their own biases to the criticism. If they say that something is a problem, often it means "Would be a problem for me." Which may not be something you need to fix. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately as the person getting the feedback, you have to decide when, in fact, a criticism is addressing a problem, and when it's simply to do with the person doing the critique having different goals than you do. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142406/#Comment_142406" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-05T08:23:18+00:00" title="May  5, 2008  8:23AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aw c'mon, Filip!<br/><br/>I think I am a relentlessly charitable reader, so I am inclined to see "this isn't a roleplaying game" as "I don't see the roleplaying in this game" phrased in an unfortunate way.  <br/><br/>We are in complete agreement that anybody who wants to shut down discussion by applying personal definitions is, at best, not being helpful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142408/#Comment_142408" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-05T08:40:44+00:00" title="May  5, 2008  8:40AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I think I am a relentlessly charitable reader, so I am inclined to see "this isn't a roleplaying game" as "I don't see the roleplaying in this game" phrased in an unfortunate way.</blockquote>\nWhat's unfortunate about it?

But he did it totally right, and it didn't put me on the defensive at all. The fact he followed up with his thoughts of how to make Emergent more RPG-like went a loooong way as well. The fact he asked the question prompted me to think more deeply on the subject, and then get into a dialogue about it with him.<br/><br/>For the record, this is how he worded it:\n<blockquote>Why does this need to be a role-playing game? I'm not saying it isn't one, but is it the most fun as one? It seems to me to be best focused as a strategy game with negotiation, like Diplomacy. Right now, I think it's straddling the edge of definition between a strategy game and a role-playing game. That's fine, but it doesn't have enough role-playing in it to be fun as that -- and I think you mentioned that, above.</blockquote>\nI disagreed and provided my own thoughts back based on AP, as well as acknowledging it's possibly a problem area.<br/><br/>Anyway, point is, it can be a good place to start a conversation.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142511/#Comment_142511" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-05T16:00:42+00:00" title="May  5, 2008  4:00PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right.

To critique is to judge. To cast judgments. Critiques are opinions, not laws. Kynn, my problem with you saying "But is it a role-playing game?" is presumptive is that ALL judgment is presumptive. All critique. Where does it stop?<br/><br/>I'm married to a writer. She did the Clarion thing, where other really talented writers and some published authors and editors tear the shit out of your work. She developed a thicker skin. Her attitude is that sometimes critics are just wrong, and she takes what she can use from them. <br/><br/>I agree that getting into definitional wars about what is or what isn't a role-playing game aren't useful. Really, getting into any kind of semantic argument is rarely useful to a conversation about anything more than semantics. When I see my discussions going that way (oh my god, is this one of them?), I back off. I did that with Tomas in my analysis of his game. We started debating definitions and how we used terms. I agreed to use his terms for further discussion. No big deal.<br/><br/>When I analyze a game and tell its author that there's a categorization problem ("this isn't a role-playing game"), I am assuming that they want it to be a role-playing game. That is, they want it to be the kind of RPG I think it isn't.<br/><br/>Now, let's say I'm totally wrong. I go, "Hey, Paul B, this isn't a role-playing game." Let's say Paul doesn't give a shit. He says, "So?" Definitional wars require two to tango. If you, the designer, refuse to tango, you can just point and laugh at my solo dancing and shrug your shoulders. I'm just annoying at that point, and likely not useful to the discussion. I don't think I'm destructive though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elegua" title="elegua"><img alt="elegua" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elegua">elegua</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142704/#Comment_142704" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T13:36:07+00:00" title="May  6, 2008  1:36PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here are some role-playing pitches I have been working on.

Now, are those questions raised again in play? Hmm, mostly familiar with monopoly - I'd say no, it might resolve the questions in your pitch, but it doesn't raise those questions in play at all, as far as I can see. Perhaps a redesign? Less focus/handling time on resolution, more on question raising? Like the questions in your pitch? Okay, pretend answer there, but if you were serious then that's exactly the design advice I'd give.<br/><br/>In other words, I let you, the author define roleplay by describing the contents of the game you call a roleplay game. Then I can in a relatively objective way, measure whether those contents actually are in the game.

We each have our own definition of what a RPG is, but we try to interact as if there is consensus on the issue. Each RPG enthusiast has fallen in love with some subset of elements and decided that those are what make an RPG and anything less is undeserving of the name. Independent game design has been pushing the element and widening the genre into places that make many traditionalist RPG players uncomfortable but also excite another group which want to explore game elements largely ignored by the mainstream role-playing community.</p>\n<p>The post was to try and help people explore a style of game design where the designer takes a set of mechanics and a set of story elements then grafts them together resulting in an RPG. This is a quite successful method for many publishers of mainstream role-playing games, but how far can that go before the edge of RPG land is reached? Many definitions of RPG out there would include Clue.

I doubt even the three judges could come to a concensus on the precise definition, let alone the huge can of worms that would open for complaints about the competition.<br/><br/>The nature of Game Chef is that it isn't so much about the winning, as the taking part, it's an old cliche but never has it been more apropriate. Figure skating, on the other hand, is a very different competition... it's all about points and winning, not about taking part and experimentation.<br/><br/><i>Edit: Cross posted with Graham... but I like to think we basically have the same point.</i><br/><br/>As a side note (or maybe back on the origional topic), both the critiques of my game brought up the 'roleplay gameyness' of my entry, but they made both valid and helpful points. The first critique suggested how to intergreate RP into the system more while the other critique actually suggested I could ditch the RP and make it a board game.<br/>Radical maybe, but maybe roleplay was a 'sacred cow' for my game that needed slaughtering (maybe not, the roleplay side was what gets me going about the game). Either way, having the 'is it a roleplay?' question brought up in a constructive way has helped a lot.<br/><br/>John,                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142808/#Comment_142808" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-07T06:37:08+00:00" title="May  7, 2008  6:37AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2008 6:38AM by Andy.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: elegua</cite>Yes, but given the diversity of these definitions where are the outer bounds of the collective?

It was written with the clear intention of nothing more than to get a rise out of the reader (or perhaps it was a theraputic exercise for the original author, maybe; perhaps someone who Needed to Scream, and just wrapped it in a roleplaying game). I read through the entry, and was like, "Ha ha, ok you got me there" and clarified the rules of that event: <br/><br/>Basically, I didn't want someone to pull out some sort of faux-artist bullshit "the Art is YOU!" ("Poo: The Roleplaying Game", where the document contains nothing but pictures of poo) crap to get a rise out of others, while all the rest of the people in the event are actually trying to create something fun and playable. Because while it's easy enough to dismiss and all ("Hah, nice joke. Next."), when it comes to assigning the games out for feedback, that means that someone's fakey "I want to get a rise out of someone" unplayable thing that was written in 15 minutes is going to get the same care, attention and handling as someone else's honest game they spent hours working on.<br/><br/>That's the only reason for the rule.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142827/#Comment_142827" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-07T08:01:48+00:00" title="May  7, 2008  8:01AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good reason for the rule, Andy.<br/>----------<br/>I, now (finally!) have gotten three critiques and, well....<br/><br/>"Hi, I'm David, and my game is not a role playing game." ("Hi, David.")<br/><br/>I intentionally wanted to place the players squarely, dead on the line between self and character, by expecting players to address real, personal issues, but through the fictional lens of a nebulous setting ("The Party Under The Bed") and a stylized character form (a plush toy--NOT a voodoo doll or self-portrait or photo). And my reviewers are all--aside from being terrified to actually play it to the hilt--failing to find the "role playing" in it... or the "game," for one reviewer. They see it as only playing oneself, with a mask on. I say the mask is a role; and even the self is one, most times--who among us REALLY, ALWAYS is true to their personality and needs, and NEVER plays a role to suit some fiction in "real life"?<br/><br/>Anyway... I can use that feedback ONLY because the reviewers unpack the points they found contrary (which I'd call Zen, but that's another thread). One spoke of "light, nuthin-but-characters" play, and sure, I could expand some sections to cover that. One spoke of "starting small, with less intense issues," and sure, I can give advice about that in there, too--the art doesn't quite fit a Scar for "Lazy," but fuck it. I can DO that, ya see?<br/><br/>But those reviewers who, for instance, chose to ignore or gloss-over my quoting of Meguey's "I will not abandon you is not no one gets hurt" article in full--including IWNAY and NGH abbreviations which, dig it, one reviewer though were game titles (?!?)--means they basically tossed the true core of the game out... and then, yeah, wow, there's not much reason to play, here, now, huh? Entirely fictional characters with minor, nuisance issues, playing with other players who promise never to hurt each other... fuck,  it, man, go play D&amp;D, I say. They want to strip away or ignore all three legs of the stool that is FMA, and then wonder at the useless board left behind ("it would make a good horror game"--seriously? With Plush dolls?!?). That's the yang of the yin of good definitional work (i.e. "I think an RPG is THIS")--you end up having to adjust a critique to accommodate what they have ignored or what they expect to work differently, while simultaneously avoiding the (understandable) tendency to make the very changes they suggest, which might only lead an "innovative" game back to the herd of "proper, complete" RPGs.<br/><br/>Yeah, I'm trying to sort my thinking out before replying to my reviewers. At this point, I am largely inclined to ask direct questions--"Which part was under-written; where would you like to see more examples of play; in what sort of play would you feel safe to engage?"--and just use them as eyes on pages. I mean, seriously--if you wrote a game which had, in its third paragraph, a rule that is called "The Prime Directive"... and your reviewer begins with "I'm gonna skip over this stuff because I don't understand it"... what in heavens' name can I do with that? You've all ready Meguey's article--it's one page of superior conciseness in theory and example; it's perfect. I will do a VERY "soft edit" on it in the final pub--expand IWNAY and NHG, and include "play" after those terms, to be totally clear--but I don't know what to say to someone who can't understand that article and, thus, rather than work at it, skips it.<br/><br/>"The Prime Directive"... ignored... because it's a new concept for you... and might take two readings of a single page of examples to figure out?<br/><br/>What do ya do with THAT?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142830/#Comment_142830" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-07T08:09:35+00:00" title="May  7, 2008  8:09AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As the guy who introduced the rule originally I think my explanation was something like:<br/>\n<br/>\n"We have to narrow down the contest in some way, so we don't get just any sort of entry. It's part of the limitations in general that make the contest work. Look at your work, and determine for yourself if it's a RPG. If it's not, don't submit it. If you're not sure, submit it, and perhaps you'll have expanded the field of RPGs." <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't want to search up my actual quote, but it's something like that. <br/>\n<br/>\nI did say that I might downgrade the score for an entry (this was back when I alone scored every entry), if I thought it wasn't substantively a RPG. But even if Andy's theoretical "Poo" had been entered, I would have simply rated it very low, not disqualified it. For me, at least, it wasn't an attempt at all to define RPGs or something, but instead to create yet another constraint for the contest. The basic one. It's a RPG. It has these ingredients. Etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, yeah, though somebody who won could crow about having won, my ratings were really just a method of feedback. In practice, since I'm one guy with my own odd tastes, the winners didn't tend to be the games that were published or successful in actual play. So obviously the "winners" are really not especially so, but instead are merely getting critique that says that the game looks cool. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's more about challenging yourself inside of a set of constraints which tend to make people actually produce something. Which is useful in that some designs come out of it, but even more useful in that it's practice for people which hopefully translates into later, better designs. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo that extent, I laud the folks who make games that get the question "Is it a RPG" because I believe that all of them were trying to make good RPGs that simply are innovative in some ways. Yeah, there is a tendency for some of them to be "boardgamey" (what's sometimes called "parlor games" in some cases), but in making these, and checking out whether or not this is the case, we learn something about what we want from our designs. John now understands that he doesn't want a boardgame, but something that is somehow fundamentally to him a RPG. And he knows some places where that might fall away, if not supported. <br/>\n<br/>\nNote that I consider every failure in Game Chef to be as important as every success. I've always maintained that producing a game in such short order is bad for designs, other than it tends to make them happen. You would never do this if you wanted to make a good game. It's an exercize. If somebody does manage to come up with a design that they then further develop over time into something that equates to good actual play, great! But that's not why we have the contest. We have the contest to practice the skills of design, and perhaps to generate inspiration. But not to create good playable games. That's nigh impossible. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs such, any critique of the game is saying, "I know it's not a real game, but if it were, it would have these problems, so watch for that next time you actually take the time to do the design. Apologies if you would have done this had you had more time, but I cannot know that." In that context, it's just fine to say, "it's not a RPG" as long as you go the extra mile to explain what that means, and perhaps try to suggest some way to fix it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't understand at all how any of this is controversial. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20K" title="John K"><img alt="John K" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20K">John K</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142831/#Comment_142831" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-07T08:16:43+00:00" title="May  7, 2008  8:16AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David,<br/><br/>If three people can read your game and not get the central premise, maybe it needs rewording, more emphasis or drawing more attention to... even if you think it's plainly obvious.

Write it again. <br/>\n<br/>\nOK, if it's one person, and you think that they might not have put in a basic level of effort to learn the rules... then you can ignore that data point. As soon as it's more than one person, however, you have a phenomenon, and you need to address it. <br/>\n<br/>\nNo matter how clear you think the text is, that doesn't mean that it actually is clear to others. When this is the case, it's hard to see why they can't understand, and it's also hard for the person in question to see why they would be able to understand, and, thus explain the disconnect. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is why editors exist. Because they sit in the middle between the author and the reader. They are neither so close to the writing that they fail to see the problems in communication, nor are they oblivious as to the intent of the text. So they can tell you how to re-write so that others can understand. <br/>\n<br/>\nAssume that your text communicates what you think it does at your own risk. If people didn't get Meg's lines... well frankly the first time I read her stuff on that subject I had to take some time to figure out what she was on about. In fact, if I had to recapitulate it right now, I think I could not. There's something about that idea that seems to be very intuitive to some, but for people like me, is very confusing. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142885/#Comment_142885" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-07T10:36:51+00:00" title="May  7, 2008 10:36AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, John and Mike--I hear your main points about rewriting, and I have every intention of doing so. My plan is to "weave" all their comments into the draft, at appropriate places, and then write until I can say the comment is answered (then see if they agree). The process IS working. That's sort of what I was posting about above: the feedback I've gotten is showing me where I can expand descriptions and explanations.<br/><br/>The disconnect I am feeling comes from "it is not an RPG, it's group therapy with a few procedures". If one was using a voodoo doll/full-length photo, then I could see that. But part of the point is to "frame" yourself and your issue using the choice of plush doll. That framing makes the "role," the fact that others participate makes the "playing," and ... shit, well, there's not a lot of "game" there, actually, truth be told. It's very NAR--loose scene framing; almost-freeform "conflict" resolution, when there is an actual conflict or means to resolve it (excepting some of the Spike mechanics); emphasis on developing and exploring an issue more than a personality or setting. I use the line "you are--and you are not--your character" for a reason; likewise, I state that "experienced role players [in FMA will] walk the line between self analysis and character embodiment" to try to further emphasize that this rush-up, face-it, step-back to reflect cycle of a scene IS role playing. Otherwise, Scene 1 is going to shove the participating players in front of a stark mirror, and end in crying jags all around. THAT's when it's group therapy with procedures: the moment in which the players forget the "fictional lens," take other players' pushing as "malicious hurting," and disengage.<br/><br/>So, hmm, that's another point to build up, in my section about The Prime Directive (which, by the way, I reiterate at least once in mid-text and hammer home in the conclusion).<br/>----------<br/>Anyhow... I should take this to my critique threads, now. All i was really trying to add to this thread is how being told it's "not an RPG" pointed me to spots where I could embellish, because my reviewers unpacked what they meant by that statement and didn't just leave it sitting there staring at me with accusing--but confusing--eyes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142928/#Comment_142928" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-07T12:21:43+00:00" title="May  7, 2008 12:21PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More generally, when reading a critique, remember that the impressions of the person doing the critique are often what's really valuable. They may be dead wrong about something about your game... but why are they dead wrong about it? How did they get that impression? Your "game" is a text, one that gives an impression of how to play. If people get the wrong impression, then there could be all sorts of things that contribute to why that's happening. Look at the feedback as a way for you to figure out how to give the right impression of what play is about. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhich deals with not just which words you use, but, dare I say it, the art you use. The order of presentation. Formatting of the text, and layout. <br/>\n<br/>\nSeek professional help!

roleplaying game? Which, to me, is a different question than the open-ended "But is it a roleplaying game?"<br/><br/>What are the absolute, non-negotiable must-have elements, whichout which you can point at something and clearly say, "This is not a roleplaying game"?<br/><br/>It's easy enough with every other kind of game out there. Videogames need computers. Card games need cards. Mini game need minis, or other absolute representations of force on a field. Board games need a shared space -- probably a board, but not necessarily -- where information can be collectively viewed.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142990/#Comment_142990" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-07T19:23:23+00:00" title="May  7, 2008  7:23PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2008 7:28PM by Callan_S.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting, Paul. I was about to say that's just talking about the medium involved - computer, card, mini or board. But probably the big problem with the term 'roleplay' is that it's commonly used to refer to both medium AND content. It's rather like saying that speaking english involves speaking about british things - if you were to speak in english about french things, it wouldn't be speaking english. Roleplay has the same sort of issue - the content is seen as being just as important as the medium. Which doesn't really make sense.<br/><br/>For example, the 'Bobby is special' game from above is seen as a non roleplay game. I'd say that's mixing up medium and content again. It'd be more practical to just call it a gibberish roleplay game. When someone speaks gibberish in english, like 'How with that and on now can is there' it doesn't cease to be the english language. But the content is rubbish. Same with a roleplay game - Bobby is special is a roleplay game, even if its content are gibberish.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_143002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143002/#Comment_143002" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T01:54:41+00:00" title="May  8, 2008  1:54AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2008 2:00AM by TomasHVM.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Norway we have established institutions for professional advice on manuscripts. I've led one of them myself, aimed at RPG-manuscripts. The advice given by the <i><b>"book-consultant"</b></i> can be as hard to swallow as that of the newspaper critic. But it is usually given with the intention of being contructive to your project. I belive this is what most of us hope for when posting our projects on sites like this, or when reading the comments on our game in GameChef. We all want positive feedback, and if our game fail to convince; then we want some constructive advice on how to develop it.<br/><br/>I believe rhetorical questions like "Is this really a roleplaying game", or blatantly stating that it is not, is a bit counterproductive in such a setting. Blind and unnecessary rhetorics are very common the net, so there is no short-term solution to the dilemma. However; to discuss the problem here is one way of dealing with it. It makes more people aware of how such questions and attitudes may hinder constructive dialogue. "Critics" (those giving advice) on the net may learn from it,a nd gamesmiths may learn to ignore these questions (or to answer very briefly: "Perhaps my game is not a RPG, but let us assume it is").<br/><br/>Have a nice day. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143100/#Comment_143100" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T12:22:42+00:00" title="May  8, 2008 12:22PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>* Building a card game.<br/>* Building a board game.<br/>* Building a computer game (using RPG Maker, etc).</blockquote>\nBut people have been building card games and board games in Game Chef for years.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><br/>But more importantly, I didn't want to see any more "<b>Bobby is Special</b>".</blockquote>\nI actually kind of was amused by Bobby Is Special.

The "also". <br/><br/>No one came to Game Chef to create Crazy Eights, or Mahjongg: A card or board game completely devoid of roleplaying. That's what the "must be a roleplaying game" clause is there for. So as not to give a well-meaning outsider the wrong idea... which actually happened in 2006, two people signed up thinking to make board games: <i>Not board games which are also roleplaying games</i>, but actual real "no roleplaying allowed" board games, because they saw a link to the event posted on Boardgamegeek.com. I didn't want that to happen again.<br/><br/>If you can't tell the difference between a game which is solely a card game (Crazy Eights), a game which is solely a board game (Mahjongg) and a roleplaying game, there's really no where else this discussion can go.\n<blockquote>At least two people have created games which can only be played using computers (one last year, one this year, that I'm aware of).</blockquote>\nYou forgot the end of the sentence there: "which can only be played using computers <b>as tools</b>." None of the entries, NONE OF THEM, were submitted as exe files which open up into games, or as Inform-7 Infocom-style text adventure game scripts. The entries that required a computer were not <b>computer games</b>. My 2006 entry, Hegemony, required a computer to organize and play, but all the play happened in online sessions. I saw another game which required the use of blogs to interact with other people through a computer, but it itself was not a computer-encapsulated game. No coding was involved.<br/><br/>I mean, what are you arguing, really?

It's about the folks who have mental issues, and instead of deciding to talk it out with friends, drink a beer and get over it, or share it on a blog or something, they write games like Bobby Is Special or Rahowa or Hybrid or whatever, some cathartic masturbatory exercise... which by the nature of the contest, will <i>have</i> to be read and reviewed by others. <br/><br/>I'd rather those people get a shrink, or write their joke on their livejournal or whatever, rather than chain a few folks to reviewing the thing. <br/><br/>As Mike said, though, it really takes no time at all to go "Hah, yeah this is cute. I skimmed it, then ranked it zero, but it had a few funny jokes". But still, that's some fat that I'd like to trim if possible. Luckily, to date I don't think we've seen any Bobby Is Specials, or Rahowas, or Hybrids or other similar "I must scream but instead I will write an RPG" exercises.

One guy was CONVINCED that, if you could substitute coins or some other token and play with one set, it wouldn't qualify for our "two set" requirement (we borrow some from Game Chef, vis a vis theme- or mechanical- or product-based design restrictions). Then someone pointed out that 99% of Icehouse games can be played with Legos... and he (sort of) shut up about it. Kind of.<br/><br/>Well, not really--he's a belligerent Spaniard, and wouldn't shut up until we said we'd "consider" games that tread the line... and then disregarded such consideration entirely--if the designer said it takes two sets, we took him or her at his or her word.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ekb" title="ekb"><img alt="ekb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/eoin.keith.boyle/PaperMinis/photo?authkey=loUrPy_XpCM#5179497271158413234"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ekb">ekb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145729/#Comment_145729" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-23T13:04:29+00:00" title="May 23, 2008  1:04PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: KynnI just gotta vent somewhere...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems that the one thing that bugs me more than anything else with Game Chef critiques (either of my own game or someone else's) is when someone pops up to say "this isn't really a roleplaying game!"
