It makes me kind of curious what lessons from webcomics are lessons that can be applied (or are being applied!) to indie games.<br/><br/>Some of my favorite points:\n<blockquote>\u2022 The idea of critical analysis of webcomics has largely died out. Sure, people still blog about webcomics and "review" them and stuff, but it's become a tiny, tiny niche sector. I think this is mainly because there's not a whole lot of point to reviewing something anybody can go look at for free and make up their own mind about! Is this a good thing? I have no idea.<br/><br/>\u2022 It's gotten easier and cheaper to start your own comic. Hosting is ridiculously cheap at the entry level these days. Site tools like WordPress and ComicPress and Blogger make putting together a basic website relatively simple and painless.<br/><br/>\u2022 Community is still important. Makin' friends with other creators, getting linked by other, more established comics, and <i>not being a jerk on the internet</i> are still the main ways new comics get that first leg up.<br/><br/>\u2022 There's still no 100% guaranteed path to success. People have been having the same cyclical conversation about "how do I make my comic more popular" on blogs and message boards for the past six years and nobody has yet found the BIG SECRET FORMULA FOR WEBCOMICS STARDOM. This is because there isn't one. It's a combination of talent, work ethic, dumb luck, and timing. And yet some people still spend more time talking about their webcomic (or being bitter about its lack of success) than they do trying to make it better.<br/><br/>\u2022 The sky is still the limit. We're nowhere near saturation as far as potential audience goes. Back in 2003 I thought there would NEVER EVER be another webcomic anywhere near as popular as Penny Arcade. Now we've got XKCD and Cyanide &amp; Happiness who are either as big or bigger. Anybody who thinks we're all competing for some fixed amount of potential readers is completely mistaken. It's not a zero-sum game, which is great because it means there's plenty of room for everybody, new folks and old hands alike, to grow!<br/></blockquote>\nHe also attributes a big part of why people are making more money doing webcomics to <a href="http://topatoco.com/hey/" rel="nofollow">Topatoco,</a> which does distro and also I think handles printing for T-shirts and etc (though I'm not sure, I should find out though). Do you think something similar is feasible for indie games?  There's IPR, but I mean a one-stop merch shop that also covers or at least does the go-between stuff for merch creation? What do you think the RPG equivalent of some of this stuff would be?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237825/#Comment_237825" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-16T05:40:24+00:00" title="October 16, 2009  5:40AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Outside of the ubiquitous Burning Wheel organizatsiya, who enjoys the frothing love that compels people to buy hoodies?

I haven't done any research into whether people would want them, though, which is why it's just been an idea.<br/> <br/>I also meant in a broader sense, not just merch printing but game printing as well.

(Also, although they don't seem to have gotten all that far, if the bonus videos from conventions are any indication the guy behind it is a promotion MACHINE.)<br/><br/>Also I'm actually in the process of getting a webcomic off the ground right now (and this stuff is getting me that much more excited about it!), and while it's a little early for worrying about merchandise, my philosophy for T-shirts is that they need to be both attractive to fans and something that folks who've never heard of the comic would want to get. And yeah, I could totally see people picking up the 3:16 insignia pins even if they don't play RPGs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237865/#Comment_237865" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-16T08:28:40+00:00" title="October 16, 2009  8:28AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love my Ashcan Front shirt.

The T-shirts caught my eye while browsing). If they'd had comic-referencing logos, characters, etc., I wouldn't have gone near them.<br/><br/>So yeah, I might love an RPG to death, but there's no way I'm about to buy a T-shirt with a game logo or catchphrase on it. Same with other types of game-related merchandise - I love Hot War, but am I going to find a use for a Special Situations Group lapel badge? Nope.<br/><br/>However, I may not be the target audience - I've not worn a band-themed shirt shirt since about age 19 either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239129/#Comment_239129" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-26T07:28:22+00:00" title="October 26, 2009  7:28AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This stuff is all useful and very informative!

I listened to their Comic-Con panel and "New Media" podcasts episodes.<br/><br/>1. They're going crazy leveraging different kinds of social media to build (and better maintain) readership. Twitter, Facebook, SumbleUpon, Reddit, that kind of thing. Some of it is to give lazy readers reminders when new comics and such come online, and some of it is to put links to the comic in front of people who might otherwise have never heard of it.<br/><br/>2. When the time comes to publish in print, a webcomic is in a sense worth more than a comic submitted to a publisher, because it's already had an "advertisement" going on for a year or more.<br/><br/>3. Paid subscription models basically only work for porn.<br/><br/>4. "Support" for a webcomic isn't just about money. In the long run people can potentially do more for a webcomic by giving it publicity than by sending the artist money or buying merch. There's a webcomic called nemu*nemu that actually has a "<a href="http://www.nemu-nemu.com/2008/02/12/recruiting_for_the_nemunemu_st.php" rel="nofollow">street team</a>" offer where they have flyers you can print up, and if you send them a photo showing you've posted one up in public they'll mail you a little surprise.<br/><br/>I think the whole thing about perceived limits on audiences is partly because people underestimate how many new niches might exist. The experience Jake and Ben and company had at Kumoricon running RPGs for anime fans, certainly suggests that anime fans are a prime example of a base where RPGs have a whole lot of potential. There are a lot of webcomics aimed at video gamers or sci-fi fans or whatever, but like RPGs, webcomics can be about pretty much anything, and potentially appeal to just about anyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/grapplethetroll" title="grapplethetroll"><img alt="grapplethetroll" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.bcslaski.com/images/me50.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/grapplethetroll">grapplethetroll</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239235/#Comment_239235" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-26T20:33:42+00:00" title="October 26, 2009  8:33PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neko: That's awesome that you're starting a webcomic.

It's VERY good and inspirational. Also, VERY MUCH DITTO on your #3 point. Subscription models will NOT work for this sort of thing. You may make enough to pay your phone bill, but it will never be a main source of income. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm a very big fan of the webcomics/free content business model, and would love to see it applied to more things. It's a LONG TERM business model though. Never forget that unless you love what you're doing, this isn't the model for you if you want to make money anytime soon. It can take years to build an audience large enough on this model to make any more than pizza money or your webhosting costs back. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou have to be approachable, personable, and LOVE that you have fans. You have to treat them as people, and not cashflow. This model almost cannot work without community and social interaction with your fans. Most of your money will be coming from merch/tie-in sales, and it's quite common that merch (especially T-shirts) has NOTHING to do with the free content you're distributing.

The places described could be anywhere from Atlantis to the Malayan Straights, Viking fjords to Maori villages. Anywhere that there had been a seagoing culture could have been a prime candidate for one of these mini-supplements. I had thought of the option of selling them as PDFs, a dollar each or an ongoing annual subscription (with a minimum of six guaranteed supplements) for five dollars.<br/><br/>Once I accumulated a dozen or so settings, I was going to compile a few together under a common theme ("Four Ports in the Carribean", "Resting Places of the Great Old Ones", "Places of Myth", etc.). These books were going to be printed POD style, with a few optional rules for campaign ideas and bonus material. <br/><br/>I never got around to it though. I'm due for a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">revision</span> rewrite of the game soon, so once the new version is released I might go back to that idea.<br/><br/>There are plenty of cool ways that webcomics have tried to tap new technologies, and a few lessons that we could really pick up from them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239241/#Comment_239241" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-27T00:00:30+00:00" title="October 27, 2009 12:00AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I own more Tabasco-themed ties than I have ever consumed bottles of Tabasco.<br/><br/>Just sayin'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243381/#Comment_243381" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-24T06:50:53+00:00" title="November 24, 2009  6:50AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 24, 2009 6:51AM by Sebastian.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've set up a PoD 'stuff' shop with <a href="http://www.zazzle.co.uk/cobwebgames*" rel="nofollow">zazzle</a>.<br/><br/>There's a 10% margin, which is fuck all on a \u20ac20 t-shirt, but they do all the hard work, so I guess it's fair.

Multiple stores can even be linked to the same account for counting the affiliate/store volume bonus; the trick though would be that you would have to have a trusted source/method to split up and send out the payments.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
