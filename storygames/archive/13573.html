As we were prepping to play I realized I was really excited. This game is so great.<br/><br/>Lukuls (my dude) managed to unify the savage tribes and lead them on a hunt of a giant snakebeast the plagued a nearby forest. They managed to wound it terribly and drive it back into its lair, and Lukuls rose to become warchief of the unified tribes.<br/><br/>Mirabelle (Carly's dudette) descended into a city that had sunk into a hole that led to hell. She challenged the demon guardian of the dead city and defeated it in a duel by sucking it into her Recepticon (this strange artifact that takes the place of her hand and has an opening in the palm).<br/><br/>How about you?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306750/#Comment_306750" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-04T04:26:27+00:00" title="January  4, 2011  4:26AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 4, 2011 2:39PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apocalypse World.

It was pretty fun! The Pyrokinetic Hawkoid, Yeti Mind-Coercer, and Seismic Giant fought some badger-people and pig-men, then some carnivorous grass and a flying lion with laser eyes. The giant kind of died for a second, but he got better.<br/><br/>I ran it with zero prep, so that was nice. It plays a lot faster than 4e, but could maybe benefit from a bit more 4e rules pruning. Also, it <i>really</i> needs totally random encounters (to go with the rest of the fun randomness), so I'm gonna bang up some tables. Neatly arranged, level-appropriate fights are pretty lame for Gamma World.<br/><br/>They came <i>this close</i> to putting everything you need in the box, too. If they had cards for weapons, ancient junk, and character origin stuff, things would have been much easier (I have since found <a href="http://critical-hits.com/features/gamma-world/" rel="nofollow">fan made materials</a>). Still, much better as a quick-play game than 4e.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307221/#Comment_307221" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-07T05:48:46+00:00" title="January  7, 2011  5:48AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played <a href="http://playthisthing.com/visitor" rel="nofollow">The Visitor</a> last night (richly-deserving winner of the 2010 Little Game Chef contest).

For example, when faced with a jerk health-store sales manager's beloved bichon frise, he (naturally) rolled "Eating and Excrement", and immediately stowed the dog in his secondary stomach.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307258/#Comment_307258" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-07T08:03:38+00:00" title="January  7, 2011  8:03AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apocalypse World - Seventeethish session of our In The Wake campaign. <br/><br/>After several pretty dark sessions we got some glimpses of light.

And there's a mirror universe of evil where our missing friend is. <br/>System is fun and interesting, character creation is confusing and over-layered, but overall it's inspired me a great deal as far as picking up old designs and sort of Smallville-ing them. <br/><br/>I also played SEVEN HOURS of Arkham Horror, only to lose at the eleventh (okay, seventh) hour 'cause the last Doom token awoke Azathoth, and he destroyed the planet. Man, like, I went toe to toe with freakin' Ithaqua for one round and WON, and still we lose to dumb old Azathoth? Oh, well. <br/>We were playing with all the expansions - the board was about six, seven feet long, and we had about thirty different decks of cards lined up along it. Intense.

We were a duo of elves who investigated a bloody scene of massacre.<br/><br/>Highlights:<br/><br/>Whitebread high fantasy! Delicious!<br/><br/>Character creation... Easy, fun, and your guy is instantly rooted into the fiction of setting. Like Burning Wheel, only not fiddly.<br/><br/>If you play an elf, your name gets special treatment - you get to name yourself after an elemental force or a special being, and then you gain its awesome powers, for use in the game just like any other trait!<br/><br/>Investigation of a small bloodbath by bandit eventually shows there is a more powerful force behind them... The buildup to it! From the bloody battlefield to babblings by its lone survivor to the tracking them in the woods to the gaping wound someone left in the secret magical elven shortcut realm, to the necklaces of people we killed turning out to be pendants of enslavement, to a wispy demon announcing its presence, to running after it wildly through the forest... Hell yeah!<br/><br/>Cryptic elven banter. For some reason, it is remarkably satisfying to talk in nothing but riddle and metaphor when you get a chance. Would probably have been less fun if the party had more racial diversity to it, but just being a couple of elves allowed us to speak in nothing but stuff like "We may have found more than we were looking -- a knife in fire." "Then that knife must chip and shatter." without fear of pissing other people off. Remarkably, we also understood each other quite well throughout the process, and had a blast doing it. Having so much fun with language was in fact my biggest surprise with this game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy" title="DeBracy"><img alt="DeBracy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nTIWP6SSS5BV3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy">DeBracy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307537/#Comment_307537" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-09T12:56:02+00:00" title="January  9, 2011 12:56PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 9, 2011 1:01PM by DeBracy.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's been a weekend of intense gaming at the local convention, S\xe4vCon (S\xe4var, Sweden). Sessions have ranged from pretty lousy to pretty awesome. The session of Montsegur 1244 last night where I played Phillipa and Joscelin was the best of the lot. Four highlights:\n<ul>\n<li>Cecile has to deliver the news to Pierre Roger and Phillipa that their child is ... "deficient" (some form of developmental disability symbolically symbolised by a harelip). Pierre Roger has an outburst and blames Phillipa.</li>\n<li>Bernard takes consolamentum with Pierre Roger as a Perfect and confesses to being the real father of Phillipa's son. Pierre Roger still performs the rite, even though the impact of Bernard's words are obvious.</li>\n<li>Faye cries out "She's not our real mother, she hates us!" when Cecile accidentally talks about Arsende as Faye's and Amiel's mother. Suddenly I'm close to tears as I think about what their foster mother, the harlot, goes through to provide for them...</li>\n<li>Cecile, in a moment of reckless well meaning, promises to give consolamentum to Faye (13) and Amiel (5) both, so they both can go with Cecile to paradise. Of course she knows that Amiel is much too young and can't leave his earthly bonds in this life yet. What Cecile doesn't realise until after Faye leaves her side is that she's lied to Faye - and now all those who she's given consolamentum (most of the main character's since Bertrand wasn't a main) are no longer Perfect either. They're all doomed...</li>\n</ul>\nGuts were wrenched and misery was plentiful, especially for poor Sanna. She had both Cecile and Bernard as her characters and they were tied up in all the worst situations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307543/#Comment_307543" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-09T13:54:27+00:00" title="January  9, 2011  1:54PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 12, 2011 2:29PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played Dungeon World, Dowler/LaTorra/The Magnificent Koebel's Apocalypse World hack, and I set up a sympathetic nation of primitive frog-men, whose lands were being taken by rapacious gold-hungry humans, and who the PCs couldn't kill fast enough.

They then defended the first rocketship's crew from an attack by fanatical Rock Men on an un-named fragment while necessary repairs were taking place. After loading up with some cargo, they make a harrowing trip across the Graviton Wave it to the Lion Man home fragment, Simba. After making a tidy profit, they relax on a hunting preserve and participate in a feast honoring their role in preventing the Lady Roara from being taken by slavers. During the festivities they witness Queen Anathraxa's nefarious poisoning of the fragment's atmosphere. They take up arms and defend their hosts from soldiers intent on rounding up all available Lion Men (women and children too!) and taking them to the radium mines.

I don't know how I can use Lime Pit or Harsh Whisper in this context, so I decide she dies in childbirth so I can use Death - so she has the baby, but she still needs to make sure it doesn't fall into Carnun's hands - so now I use Harsh Whisper - she visits him as a ghost and her whisper is harsh.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and the bard ends up eyeless and trapped in Carnun's domain.<br/><br/>Next chapter I think I'll keep playing her, as a ghost now.

The security expert.<br/><br/><b>Yusuf al Rashid</b>: an immortal djinn and powerhouse executive. Primary investor in the Agency and mystical expert.<br/><br/><b>Jennifer Clark</b>: (aka Athena): an ambitious lawyer who left behind her family legacy of super-heroics in order to found her own company. Legal and metahuman expert. (She won't wear the tights anymore, but she still has the powers.)<br/><br/>We foiled a heist at a Swiss bank (and made a new client), then tracked down the source of the robbery to one of Yusuf's ancient foes, Ramses II.

We didn't get graphic, it was played purely for a bit of sophomoric fun. That's when Night Paws slapped him on the back and said, "Worry not, friend! My sister is very open-minded... and flexible."

It works, but needs some refinement.<br/><br/>Premise of the game is that you are infected with a supernatural dream disease that will kill you and your loved ones if you don't sacrifice yourself at the Stone Circle at Graystead. So, you will die, it is how that matters. Meant to explore end of life issues. The game runs on a complicated set of random encounter tables.<br/><br/>Quick summary of scenes:<br/>Scenes<br/>1) Faced Yuri Ilia - Sorcerer of the Dreamcult, at Elderberry Wells, with two gypsy wagons encamped 100 yards away, eldritch shootout, no consequences<br/>2) Temptation by promise of continued life with Emily. Deepened Bond with my wife.<br/>3) Faced Vivian Linda and her Band of Thieves on the High Road at midnight, swordfight, suffered minor wound. <br/>4) Temptation by playing with my children Sam and Hannah, retained and strenghthened Bond with Children<br/>5) Faced Brother Lino Vitor - Questioner, on the playground outside of Throughbridge School, many children playing, chase and escape, no one harmed<br/>6) Faced Taras Radomir - Assassin, in the Cherry Hill Inn upstairs corridor, just before dawn, scuffle that woke the Inn, aggravation of previous wound.<br/>7) Faced Eerika Helka - Common Brigand, by the ruined cathedral in the early morning, chase and escape, loss of supplies.<br/>8) Temptation by running in the woods, larch needles scattered on the trail, overcome with Grief, weakened Bond with Family.<br/>9) Faced Vivian Linda and her Band of Thieves again, inside a windmill, with the cogs and gears rattling, the mill churning, sword fight, another wound<br/>10) Faced Sister Uschi Fabiola - Dream Hunter, The crowded dining hall of The Rose restaurant, Dreaming Duel, no complications.<br/>11) Temptation with my practice as a healer, weakened Bond to Graduation.<br/>12) Faced The Black Wind, a shortcut through Chester Ridge cemetery, possibly makeable before night, chase and escape, overwhelmed with the task before me. <br/>13) Temptation with Running with my children<br/>14) Faced Vivian Linda and her Band of Thieves again, in a stand of pines on Bedron\u2019s Ridge in a rainstorm, sword fight, Vivian angry, barely escape, scared of Vivian.<br/>15) Faced Philip Gregers - Citizen Loyal to the Barron,at Farmer Gable\u2019s Farm, just after supper time, wanted to turn me in, grapple, chase and escape<br/>16) Temptation with life with Emily, deepened Bond with Emily.<br/>17) Faced The Urdhu Band - Dream Goblins, on the rope bridge above Tinker\u2019s Creek, a stiff breeze, sunset, arrows vs magic, another wound<br/>18) Temptation with reading, loss of Bond<br/>19) Temptation with stickball competitions, weakened Bond<br/>20) Temptation with playing stickball with my children, strengthened Bonds.<br/>21) Temptation with my whole family, camping and running in the woods, Strengthened Bonds.<br/>22) Faced Sir Cibr\xe1n Brais - Spymaster, In the Earth Hearth Bath House, steam thick and floors slick, naked brawl, knife vs. fists (how'd he get a knife in here?), severely wounded but escaped. <br/>23) Temptation with finishing my healer's apprenticeship. Weakened Bond.<br/>24) Temptation with my whole family at my initiation to the Healer's Society. Too much Grief to overcome. Failure and loss of game. Permanent Dreaming State.<br/><br/>In all, a good run.

I fluff-texted my heart out with really elaborate descriptions, lots of body motion, and so on, and yet it basically came down to "Hey GM! GIVE ME DICE, PLEASE" each time. Is there some GM tip that says as much?

Yikes!<br/><br/>We, four noble heroes, three demi-gods and a mortal, set forth on that awesome quest. My main takeaway from this is that the Glory mechanic is exactly what we needed to get social license to trash-talk, gloat, victory-dance, and all that. Nobody among us is particularly aggressive or competitive, but wow, this game unleashed something. We kept it friendly, but still! Every time I succeeded on an attack roll, I felt compelled to stand and pump my fists in the air.<br/>Every. Time. The secret to that is: pretty much every contest that can generate Glory (everything but Interlude contests, I think) means that beating the GM gets you a little Glory, and beating everybody at the table gets you more! <br/>I rolled a Cunning challenge to lead us on the right path through the labyrinth, burning Divine Favor like crazy, and I totally annihilated the GM's roll. Seven glory at a stretch - so awesome!<br/><br/>We took a little while getting the hang of Interlude Scene contests - at first, we didn't know that everyone could participate in such a contest, not just the contest-caller and a challenger. We milked that Interlude for all it was worth, calling one contest per player (our maximum), and then we set off to find the beast in its lair, a labyrinth under the palace. <br/><br/>Sure enough - there were minotaurs. I thought the Range Band thing for combat positioning would be lame, but it's totally not - coordinating weapon ranges, using your movement point to move yourself OR a bad guy, and protecting the archer - - all very diverting! <br/><br/>One last thought: it doesn't necessarily pay to make your character well-rounded, although that is the default. Ten-siders were pretty critical to a lot of the more dramatic successes rolled by the players. Layering bonuses from your Heroic Trait on top of your best skills is pretty great, also - contributing a d10 *and* +2 to the highest die-roll in the pool is really helpful.<br/>Overall, it's fascinating that there can be so much friendly competition between players, all with medium-but-not-threatening stakes.

I continue to be impressed with how well that game is designed and how much more fun it is than other 4E-related products, including Gamma World. By the end of the adventure, we had no healing surges left, John's rogue had only a single hitpoint, my cleric was trapped in a hellish dimension, and we basically only survived due to the whims of fate: Twyla leveled her ranger up and, thank Strahd, the tiles actually connected together in such a way that she was able to join the rest of the group (which, for most of the game, was looking increasingly unlikely).<br/><br/>Why can't Wizards design intro D&amp;D adventures that are as much fun as this boardgame?  In any event, I'm super excited for the next boardgame set, Wrath of Ashardalon (which will supposedly have campaign rules) to come out next month.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308643/#Comment_308643" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-18T08:42:44+00:00" title="January 18, 2011  8:42AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Playtested Beyond the Mirror on saturday.<br/>It went damn smooth this time! Having changed the rules so extensively paid off. I might be able to prepare the 1.2 in a month or so. I can now declare that this game works well in two. We managed to complete the story in one convention slot and it's been pretty intense, I'm very satisfied (with caution. It might have been sheer luck).<br/><br/>Basically, adding lists for the pitch was a great hit. Thanks to Sebastian Hickey for that suggestion. The Location that is in the game the spatial limit was an asylum, and the Trigger (which is the accident that triggers the entire story) was a kidnapping of an important politician come to see the situation of lunatics, possibly working on his next election program.<br/>The other guy's character was a cop called Sullivan (goal: to get a promotion), while my character, Senners, was the doc who was working with the kidnapper's rehab (goal: to save the kidnapper's life).<br/>Sullivan's memory was pretty solid: it involved his wife. Mine was duller than I'd have thought: my charater receiving a certificate of mental sanity from the asylum's director.<br/>The story ended with me trying to let the kidnapper run away after he'd killed the hostage, but being killed in the process, while Sullivan was last seen drunk on cheap liquor under the rain after his utter failure. Yet both of us managed to save our character's memories, and ended up being human.<br/>I went berserk on the other player's scars whenever he got any. He started to doubt his character's humanity when I posed such questions as "why don't you remember your wife's scent?" or "why can't you remember what she said that night?" and I'm extremely satisfied with how he described my game as wicked cruel.<br/>Now let us hope that subsequent playtests work just as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308655/#Comment_308655" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-18T10:20:47+00:00" title="January 18, 2011 10:20AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 18, 2011 10:24AM by Remi.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fiasco game Jason mentioned, Rainbow Mountain.

He's created Jacob the elven waywatcher, whose clandestine activities always seem to get him into tricky situations and difficult choices revolving around beastmen, chaos culties and hunting game. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe chose 3 location cards, one big bad he wants to encounter (a red dragon natch) and wrote a player goal of 'I'll free all the elves from beastman slavery'. Cool. Thus far the game has wound in and out of the wilds, with a few choice scenes at a chaos cultist overrun hunting lodge inspired from the core ruleset. We have hit Jacob's key skills of stealthy stuff and archery, with the odd social conflict thrown in. The narrative potential of the dice has been awesome, my nephew has really taken up the fictional possibilities represented in each roll result, succeed or fail. We've pretty much reduced all conflict to one rolled dicepool and have had great success with this technique. The action cards and talent slots provide a little mechanical advantage, but mainly persist as flags and colour.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh and best in character quote of a noob teenager roleplayer to the quintessential monster-sedorning barkeep?

Later tonight we're playing this thing set in 1971, and we're going to investigate some weird computer hardware built by ex-Nazis down in Chile that has been secretly pinging DARPANET via Telex. My friend Robo is playing a hard-bitten Army Colonel, and when asked what he needs for the mission, he writes:<br/><br/>"First thing I'll need is a console jockey. And I don't want some west coast, flower-toting professor. I need someone that will get the job done without asking questions. I got about as much use for a man with opinions as I do for a pocket on a shirt. I'll need someone that talks Mexican that can get us around down there. I'll also need someone that speaks kraut, and not just talks it, but I mean get inside their head like that Freud fellow. And then I'll need a man with eyes in the back of his head. I don't give one good goddamn that this place ain't in Russia, it's still full of reds and a red won't come at you like a proper man, he'll come at you all coward like from behind. And we'll need a mobile HQ with all the trimmings. We're going to get inside this Cybersyn and see what's what. I reckon a little come to Jesus with this Metzner lass should get us pointed in the right direction. And while we're in there, we might as well leave a little gift from Uncle Sam. Whatever those pointy heads down on the third floor have been working on, I want it."<br/><br/>So happy. I'll report back later.<br/><br/>EDIT: Later - I don't know what to say. We half destroyed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Cybersyn" rel="nofollow">Project Cybersyn</a>, but not quite. We decided, as we dragged our tattered asses out of Chile, that the only way to stop the clear and present danger of a global computer network was to arrange a crypto-fascist coup and topple Allende's socialist utopia. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_intervention_in_Chile#1973_coup" rel="nofollow">The CIA is on it</a> but it'll take like 18 months to set up.

periodically fight to the death to provide blood and strength to the group. Vision challenges his biggest rival in the cult to fight, and kills her. While he's basking in the glory, Yen the maestro'd walks onto the fight ground and cuts the victim's heart out, holds it up, and starts eating it. The new tradition is immediately taken up, and there is an orgy of cannibalism of the fallen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309783/#Comment_309783" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-26T13:32:01+00:00" title="January 26, 2011  1:32PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>*snip*</blockquote>\nYou're paying the cleaning service to get my brain off the walls, Morningstar! :shakes fist:                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy" title="DeBracy"><img alt="DeBracy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nTIWP6SSS5BV3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy">DeBracy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309799/#Comment_309799" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-26T15:27:06+00:00" title="January 26, 2011  3:27PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tonight I played some Call of Cthulhu.

Recovering from addiction to something called "Venom's" (as in, a drug made by Venom, whoever that may be)<br/>Coil, an old hand at gang-work; a little too well known among the different crews out there<br/><br/>I've played something homebrewed that's very close to Ghost/Echo, but I hadn't played the real G/E deal. <br/>This was solid. We played it "open", with almost zero setting or character information to begin - all we really had was the .pdf and the starting situation. From there, kind of Shock:esque, whenever someone mentioned something cool about the Real World, the Ghost World, wraiths, etc., it got written down as canon. That happened a lot, especially with Loot: Paper and Stones, and it was awesome. <br/>The flashback stuff meant that we had a lot to say about our characters and about the setting overall. It got very dreamlike and Sandman-ish pretty fast, with summonings, Ghost World goddesses, and Freudian Ballistics tech all rubbing cheek-to-jowl. <br/><br/>We got away with a stash of papers, despite Walker's gang leading us right into an ambush. We went to ground at my crash pad in the skinworld, where we started burning Papers - when you burn 'em with the essence of the Ghost World in the air, the red wax seals on 'em start turning into cherry-red clones of whatever object is mentioned on a given Paper.<br/>So, I huffed some Ghost World and lit a Paper labeled "Alpha Male Multiplier" - and created a bright red dog that disrupts any and all pack order and discipline on-sight. We were going up against Axis and his dogs, so it seemed appropriate.<br/>But then Walker's gang followed up on us, coming 'round to my place with the assumption that we were dead and in the Ghost World. We ended up trying to talk things over, guns drawn in a good old Mexican standoff, but then Coil jumped out the window. <br/>Walker had said something about their guns being loaded with Stones (which I guess is good; we never clarified what they are), and Coil, formerly of Walker's gang, decided to high-tail it while he could before he got plugged for being a traitor.<br/>Coil found the gang's van, with the Stone stash in it, and then sped off to a secret, prepared warehouse to stash 'em. Fucker skunked us, and we never saw him again. <br/><br/>Due to time constraints, we ended up lingering on the standoff more than the actual "quest" we'd been put on to pay off our tab with Kilo, sexy goddess of wisdom and healing and serpents. <br/>When we arrived at Belltown to fight Axis, the hound-wraith master, I pulled out a Tectonic Javelin and leveled the place; he was killed in the 'quake, the dogs were unharmed, and I kind of sort of ripped a hole in reality, which a member of the Guardians of Public Order arrived to sew shut again. Not before the dogs lost their wraithliness and became neither Ghost nor Living - shadow dogs!<br/>Kilo decided that her servitors, the viper-wraiths, should become shadowy too, and forgave us for letting our buddy kill her poor little servitors. <br/>The session ended with the vipers reborn more powerful as shadow-snakes, in the midst of a New Orleans style funeral <i>for the snakes</i> in the middle of Heartbreak Square.<br/>My guy, Hull, went back to college, and our crew boss Grip set about putting a new crew together. <br/>A firm handshake, and we were done.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310056/#Comment_310056" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-28T09:25:56+00:00" title="January 28, 2011  9:25AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We had our second brief planning discussion for Freemarket, since we keep socializing at least as much as talking about the game, and this is going to rock so hard.<br/><br/>Brandon's character, a social manipulator, got perfect death'd and woke up with no idea what happened and without an MRCZ.  So he printed out John's blank (a flood/bleed specialist) and then got the blank to alter the memories of Ping's FOB ghosting/switching immigrant to make her think Brandon is her relative.  Now they've formed a new "social impact mitigation" MRCZ called Black Lotus (negotiation, discrete, comprehensive) with the plan of finding out who did this to Brandon and making them pay.<br/><br/>With three players and the situation of Brandon's character, it's feeling a little Burn Notice-like, at least in the beginning, but seems poised to spiral out in all sorts of interesting directions.

My sublime REH moment was harpooning one of the twin giant god-spiders and hanging on for dear life as it thrashed about its golden web, bleeding out.<br/><br/>Where its blood fell, coins and gems coagulated, handily explaining why the city merchants would turn pale and close up shop when we proffered the spoils paid to us by the Cult of those same gods for an assassination we carried out at the start of the adventure.<br/><br/>Lessons learned: <br/><br/>Never turn your back on an armed guard.<br/>Our enemies will provide.<br/>Don't be the first person to attack the Spider God.<br/><br/>The game is a blast and really tightly-designed to push towards the fun and dramatic irony that's the heart of that specific sort of fantasy adventure. I felt like I had been dropped right into the middle of a particularly good issue of <i>Savage Sword of Conan</i>.<br/><br/>-JC                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310353/#Comment_310353" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-01T00:37:17+00:00" title="February  1, 2011 12:37AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I shall sharpen the edge of my jealousy until it is bright and keen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310357/#Comment_310357" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-01T04:33:55+00:00" title="February  1, 2011  4:33AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 1, 2011 4:34AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ShaneJackson</cite>I'll say!  And Remi/Joel killed my character Richmond's son in a heartwrenching scene as a result of my victorious roll to convince him to stick with the good guys.  Remi/Joel are everything that's wrong with this world!</blockquote>\nThe Brainer, Barrow, did the puppet string thing on Shane's guy's son, Grome. He had holds on him. He told Grome to convince his dad to abandon his brother, the Hardholder, and join the bad guys. Shane's guy, Richmond, manipulates his son and has a stellar success convincing him of the righteousness of sticking with his uncle and his family. This was particularly moving because Richmond fucking hates his brother. Remi and Joel interpreted this as poor lil' Grome resisting every hold and taking harm until he died from Brainer brain punishment.<br/><br/>So in one session Barrow went from a weird but OK dude to betraying his lover (the Battlebabe) and getting her shotgunned, killing his own sister (the Hardholder's lover) with his hands, and murdering the Driver's son with his brain. And he's in league with the creepy outsiders who have a chemical that can destroy the world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13573/bite-sized-ap-january-2011" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13573/bite-sized-ap-january-2011" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13573/bite-sized-ap-january-2011/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F13573%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F13573%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
