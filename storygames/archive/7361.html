If they feel the way you feel, and they want the things you want, life is going to be really, really nice.  On its own, this would indicate that the rational thing to do is, as quickly as possible, to tell them how you feel and what you want, and find out whether they feel and want the same.  After all, if they don't it's no big loss, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> is trying to get at the downside risk:  What might you <b>lose</b> by speaking out, which you could <b>keep</b> by being silent.<br/>\n<br/>\nClassic example:  "I want to tell him how much I love him ... but if he doesn't feel the same then I don't think we could even be friends any more.  It would be so awkward!  I can't bear to risk losing him so completely.  Friends is fine.  Friends is good.  I can be content with that."<br/>\n<br/>\nThe current phrasing of question <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> is inconstant in leading people to such things.  It's ambiguous.  People can also answer (quite legitimately) "His role in my dream is to be the stooge who takes the fall for my crimes, and if he found out then he'd turn me in to the cops, which would ruin everything."<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I'd like is a rephrasing of question <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> that, while <i>short</i>, is more focussed and clear.  That may well involve rewrites on questions <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe got a lot of smart, verbal folks here on the board.

That specificity evoked much more (I think) than saying "I'd lose my anonymity" would have.<br/>\n<br/>\nGod, I'm so darn picky.

"If he finds out I wrote those songs he could ... uh ... kill us all with a hacksaw!"<br/>\n(B) People hear "the worst thing" and decide that the small, subtle nightmare that they have in mind is (in classic teenage terms) the <i>very worst thing that could happen in the history of bad things</i>.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just don't know which way people's perception of the question will jump.
