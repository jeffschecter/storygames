Javelins, throwing darts, crossbows, bows etc.</p>\n<p>If you are in Ordinary Fight (i.e.\xa0no chase or volley), you don\u2019t pay ammo until you make the killing shot.</p> <small><i>(Ordinary Fight is a reference to another, older house rule that we're still using. Pretty much when you're in the same room, basically. Makes ranges easier.)</i></small>\n<p>You still make attack rolls as normal, decrease their HP as normal etc. But, their HP loss represents position, threat, stress etc. You draw back your string and you keep them marked by making attack rolls on them. And then, as they go to zero, you scratch one arrow. That was when you released the string. (If someone else swords them to death while you\u2019re threatening them w/ arrows, you save the arrow altogether.)</p>\n<p>This rule is 100% optional. If you think it\u2019s cooler to blast your foe with arrows making them look like a porcupine, you are correct. But, more options, more better, right? This rule is something you can use when you wish, ignore when you wish.</p>\n<p>This still counts as a ranged attack. So, no capturing enemies (you need m\xeal\xe9e for that) + you still get disadvantage at point blank etc etc. The only difference mechanically is that you don\u2019t use up your ammo.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464281/#Comment_464281" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-24T19:40:47+00:00" title="June 24, 2017  7:40PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This has a dual purpose.<br/><br/>To fit the "HP as stress" model (which is optional when it comes to "monsters", but we use it for "people") + To buff these weapons.

I would not phrase it in this way (it's sort of in-your-face about the essential abstraction), but it is foundationally reasonable and in line with what HP simulate.<br/><br/>The variation I like myself is to leave ammo issues undefined (D&amp;D does this a lot) until needed, at which point a current state may be established. Similar philosophy, except I do not require a player to determine blow by blow whether they're expending arrows or not, just like I don't need to usually know precisely which sword strokes cause wounds.<br/><br/>A simple mechanical implementation for a stochastic model is to equip characters with "quivers of arrows" and roll for running out on occasion (like 1/6 after every battle or whatever). As long as the supplies last it doesn't make a foundational difference how you describe your attacks. Character who aren't running out are apparently managing to scrounge arrows effectively, or perhaps they brought a few more than expected, or maybe their attacks were, indeed, mostly conceptual - we can determine the why on a case-by-case basis, just like we do with the "why did the HP drop" issue when a character "hits" something. If a character really doesn't want to run out of ammo, they'll presumably have a caddie carry extra quivers [grin].<br/><br/>The player base in my experience seems split between the ones who prefer to track ammo and the ones who don't - the latter seem happy with the above sort of arrangement, while the former want to always know exactly what they have; they might prefer your model, except I've the gut feeling that this type of player is also the type that is most bothered by the abstraction in the idea of arrowless "shooting". I suspect that this split is foremost about whether a player likes having that little number on their sheet, or whether they find it ugly and cluttersome.<br/><br/>When the ammo-tracking players scrounge for arrows, by the way, I use a simple assumption of 50% recovery - roll a low/high for roughly each arrow spent in the battle, and an exploration round later, that's how many arrows you managed to recover. Helps with not running out in a long expedition, and it's sort of a realistic, cool and ruthless thing for an archer to be doing.<br/><br/>One more observation about your rule: the way I would do that would be to say that you scratch one arrow on a killing blow <i>and</i> when you roll good damage - say over half of your maximum, or whatever. If we're doing precise tracking of when arrows fly I'd prefer it if there were also some missing and scratching arrows, instead of every notch being a kill-blow - that has the potential to make the swordsmen look ineffectual, plus I like the imagery of having arrows flying here and there.<br/><br/>By the way: what do you do with a player who insists on shooting into melee on the principle that merely aiming won't hurt their friends anyway? It might be consistent with the philosophy to simply split the "damage" (stress and fear) of a successful aim even between the combatants [grin].                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464283/#Comment_464283" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-24T20:58:56+00:00" title="June 24, 2017  8:58PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>I like it.

Is it simply the case that poisoning your weapon mandates wounds on each successful hit? Does an archer using poisoned arrows scratch an arrow on every hit?<br/><br/>Not that I disagree with your answer in general, of course, and the traditional D&amp;D way to handle poisons and such is a bit strange anyway. Would be more consistent to simply say that a successful poison attack causes more hit point damage instead of subverting the remaining HP altogether. And that's actually how I run this stuff nowadays: you're hit by a poisonous snake, and you get to choose whether to take the poison (indicating that it really did hit), or if you'd rather pay 10 HP instead (indicating that you dodged the poison fang at the last moment, after all). This approach allows me to retain save-or-die effects without obviating the HP system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dirk" title="Dirk"><img alt="Dirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dirk">Dirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464293/#Comment_464293" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-25T01:40:46+00:00" title="June 25, 2017  1:40AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2017 1:41AM by Dirk.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What if the to player has to choose whether or not to spend ammo/fire the shot blindly, without knowing if it will be a killing blow (assuming hp is hidden from the players.)

I wish I had gotten around to edit the rule to the "it represents aiming" phrasing. That's more palatable. The more you aim, the more likely you are to make that kill shot later. OTOH, what if you for some reason never make that kill shot? Someone else swords them? There, we need the threat/position interpretation available too. You're pointing your arrow at someone, walking closer, and then step into m\xeal\xe9e and use your hands to take them out of the fight. To me, it sounds really cool that you can do that!

Something like this:<br/><br/><b>Threat Attack combat maneuver:</b> When a character is capable of threatening an enemy in a way intelligible to that enemy, the player may opt to make a Threat Attack instead of a regular one. Threat attacks are resolved like normal attacks (attack rolls to establish the threat credibility, etc.), except damage is typed as psychic, melee fighters do not need to approach to engage (they need to be able to, though), and archers do not need to actually expend ammo (although they still need to notch the bow). The GM may assign disadvantage to a Threat Attack when the enemy is otherwise distracted (e.g. by on-going melee).<br/><br/><b>Aiming:</b> Instead of whatever the wussy default rule is, aiming with missile weapons is executed by selecting target and making a normal attack roll. On a success the player rolls damage, secret from the GM, and marks it down. No ammo is expended, and the enemy does not need to know that they are being aimed at. The aiming character may continue aiming for multiple rounds, but when they do release their attack, the enemy suffers the entire amassed aiming damage all at once. The aim is equivalent to a prepared action, and may be released as a reaction (causing the damage so far amassed), or the character may release it alongside an ordinary attack roll on their turn (which may miss or not, the aim damage happens nevertheless). The aim damage is lost and wasted if the archer loses sight or has to stop aiming for any reason, without actually releasing the arrow; as this is unlikely (it requires a combat event that interrupts the aim without the archer being capable of reacting in response), aiming damage may generally be considered as good as dealt, even as it is delayed.<br/><br/>(You could get by on only the aiming maneuver, but I think it's good to have variety in options. If I were archering in this paradigm, I'd totally want to first aim and then go all "I've got you in my sights! You're already dead, unless you drop your weapons now!")<br/><br/>Depending on the player tastes, the above sorts of maneuver options may work better for them than free-wheeling. It's not precisely equivalent to the simple "only scratch arrows on killing blows" approach, but the differences are I think generally intuitive, simple and worthwhile, and if you make threats and aiming clearly explicit maneuvers, the players should have less difficulty understanding what's going on. And of course, I think that the player of an archer will find the suggested aiming mechanic immensely interesting: the GM doesn't know it yet, but that monster's pretty much a goner any time I choose to release this shot.<br/><br/>Plus, I would personally find it rather amusing if the rules generally enshrined the idea that a combat consists of people shouting vile insults at each other, plus brandishing weapons, while a bunch of archers observe each other and try to guess who's going to shoot at whom, and when. Sounds entertaining.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464357/#Comment_464357" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-27T04:20:32+00:00" title="June 27, 2017  4:20AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's really interesting, Eero.<br/><br/>I'm not entirely sure how I feel about the sudden really really heavy importance of "distracting the achers", but otherwise it's a very workable, fun, and reasonably non-abstract take on the issue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464359/#Comment_464359" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-27T05:12:11+00:00" title="June 27, 2017  5:12AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice, I am considering making threat &amp; aim separate actions. There's a precedent, I have three types of fight: chases, volleys, and ordinary fight. And chases and volleys both use the exact same rules as each other. (I later came up with the idea of calling ordinary fight "same room fight" or something, "chamber fight", then it would have a name and chases and volleys wouldn't need their names.)<br/><br/>I'd keep the damage type piercing for consistency with all other threat attacks (fire 'fears' water etc) and the damage open for simplicity.<br/><br/>Hey! Wait! I just realized that you meant that the damage isn't dealt until the arrow is released, that's interesting. But it makes it very much weaker when it comes to cooperating on an enemy + I wanted the idea of losing aim, regaining aim, losing aim etc to be part of the pacing (i.e. she found aim, monster lost HP, the monster moved [archer missed attack roll], she found her aim again [with a successful roll], the monster lost more HP). Perhaps that's too close to HP as "narrativium" <img alt=":neutral:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/neutral.png" title=":neutral:"/> <br/>But I don't think so.

I only wrote that bit in there to highlight the interesting possibility of something <i>really</i> exceptional occurring to save a character otherwise marked for death. It's important for this sort of aiming mechanic to really make sense that the damage caused is pretty much a done deal, even if the enemy doesn't know about it yet.<br/><br/>Like, attacking the archer wouldn't cut it - they'd just release the shaft as a free reaction before turning to deal with the new assailant. Same for spells, an itchy trigger finger moves faster than any spell-caster (excepting perhaps the special case of an archer who has no preternatural cultural context whatsoever, causing them to misinterpret the whole situation). You would need to be able to sneak in there without the archer being aware of you at all to be able to cancel that aim. Not a normal combat condition, but perhaps just about possible in a special case, if the archer doesn't have a spotter of his own to cover his back while he's working.<br/><br/>The big reason for why I'd like to break threatening and aiming off from normal attacks like this is that I find the distinctions in when and where you can use these attacks interesting. You can't threaten mindless enemies, for instance, while "aim" is uniquely both guaranteed damage as well as retractable (you can decide to not take the shot after all) and covert (the enemy doesn't even know that they're dead). However, if you delay releasing your aim for too long, you may allow the enemy to live and cause problems for unnecessarily long.<br/><br/>The one big thing that I personally care about regarding archers and aiming is that D&amp;D is really bad at assassinations. If one were to ride this sort of logic to a consistent end, it would finally be possible to pre-load mucho damage into one bow-shot, so as to actually kill a bad guy cleverly from a well-prepared firing position. It's an interesting alternative for the various "bypass the HP and cause a direct save-or-die status effect" hacks that I generally use when characters start deconstructing the combat space in this way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464367/#Comment_464367" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-27T11:52:31+00:00" title="June 27, 2017 11:52AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The one big thing that I personally care about regarding archers and aiming is that D&amp;D is really bad at assassinations.</p></div></blockquote>\nYes, that was the impetus for this rule in the first place! I was talking to Paul in the consequence engines thread about chess murders and other shenanigans.<br/><br/>I want to be careful otoh. I don't want the player characters to get killed out of the blue ("you didn't see them, but they were drawing the bead on you for six rounds").

There is a lot of good synergy from this rule to all kinds of interesting things!<br/><br/>I'm not yet sold on this idea of the "undistractable" archer, though. It seems to me that (especially in D&amp;D! A game with magic and monsters and weird dungeons!) combat in this idiom so often involves strange and unexpected phenomena that justifying the damage done would either be awkward or really artificial sometimes.<br/><br/>Is there ever a chance of missing, for instance? You'd have to remove it for this to work - that "final" shot has to be an automatic hit.<br/><br/>In most scenarios this seems fine, but what about dragon breath, teleportation, mind control magic, shifting dungeon environments, traps... I have a feeling that this would feel really strange sometimes.<br/><br/>For instance, a thought experiment:<br/><br/>I'm aiming an arrow at my friend, because I've been Charmed and told to attack them. They're backing away towards a lever and saying, "Hey, I'm your friend! Don't shoot; I'm just going to pull this level here, OK?" <br/><br/>I'm accumulating "damage" against them and getting ready to shoot.<br/><br/>Then some instant effect happens which breaks the Charm spell - suddenly all becomes to clear to me and the illusion is dispelled! <br/><br/>How do we decide whether I "shoot" or not? Is the Charmed persona in control (as would be the case if I had not been charmed - presumably the game would be biased towards always giving me a chance to shoot, regardless of interruptions, for this rule to work at all)?

Rules texts <i>can</i> speak about this stuff, but we all play different versions of the game, and this is precisely the sort of thing that depends on the big-picture mechanical strategy of the given campaign. Besides, I didn't want to get dogmatic about how one should use these kinds of ideas: Sandra clearly started with the notion that "aiming to injure" needs to be a 100% equal option for the archer, no different from shooting, but obviously there's room for interesting tactical differences if one wants there to be.<br/><br/>For an example of more precise rules-laying that answers every one of your questions, in something like 3rd or 4th edition D&amp;D, with well-defined action types and such, the notion of "releasing the aimed shot" would be very simple, very clear: it's an "Immediate action" in 3rd edition, or a "immediate interrupt" in 4th. (As far as I remember, anyway.) All these questions about how different situations would be adjudicated, whether the archer could loose their shaft in time, would be answered by those rules categorically. Of course you could also decide that you don't like archers being quite so uninterruptable as those rules imply, so perhaps instead of an "immediate interrupt" you'd have loosing a readied shot be an "immediate reaction", or whatever.<br/><br/>Meanwhile the above sort of terminology would be essentially meaningless to some other flavours of D&amp;D. You'll need to figure out how things work in your own game. The concept is clear at least, I hope: the archer's got a shot readied to go whenever they need it to, and mechanically speaking we are already guaranteeing a certain amount of damage (HPs are not a realistic simulative element per se, I do not need to justify this in any way) whenever they decide to take the shot. It's a matter of reaction speed to do it in response to some interference, call it a second or two at most; you'll need a thoroughly immediate, unexpected way to interfere with them if you desire to prevent them from doing it - a true surprise. It may even be artificially difficult to interfere in that we may consider this a subjective stylistic right on the part of the archer: they're partaking of a genre convention or a simulative conceit, no different from e.g. the idea of initiative ("what do you mean we take turns to hit each other?"), so if we decide that it's difficult to get between an archer and their aimed shot, then it is so. Nobody except for myself seems to question the inexplicable capability of an adventurer to dig up a healing potion out of their backpack, uncork and apply it in six seconds flat, so I don't see why anybody would need to have problems with the idea that archers can loose readied shots quicker than you can interrupt them.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Is there ever a chance of missing, for instance? You'd have to remove it for this to work - that "final" shot has to be an automatic hit.</p></div></blockquote>\nThe way I described the putative action, this does not in fact matter. The aimed shot can be loosed reactively whenever, and whether it's a "miss" or not in fictional terms can be determined in the usual manner - just like any attack. One of the explicit benefits of this sort of aiming rule for the archer would be in the fact that they can choose when, precisely, the enemy dies during the combat round.<br/><br/>If the aimed shot is released in the context of one last attack roll - which seems intuitive, of course - then perhaps that last attack check can be used to determine whether the shot hits the enemy. This is, of course, entirely irrelevant to the damage already established by the earlier rolls. If that last roll hits but the damage does not suffice to kill, then perhaps it's just a shallow wound; if that last roll misses but the damage from earlier aims suffices to kill, then perhaps it's such a narrow miss that it causes the enemy to stumble and hit their head and die that way. The D&amp;D rules do not speak to this sort of combat choreography minutiae in a systematic way, so you get to determine the particulars for yourself.<br/><br/>I trust that you understand the mathematical logic behind this: the damage has already been dealt, in formal terms, by the time the archer decides to take their shot. Ordinary attack rolls have been made, with the ordinary circumstance modifiers even. Undermine the inevitability of that damage too much, and you are basically saying that this type of attack roll is not, after all, as acceptable to take as a "I hit it with the sword" maneuver. The very idea of accepting "arrowless shooting attacks" entirely presumes a willingness to allow the players to describe mechanically roughly equivalent actions in flexible ways.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>For instance, a thought experiment:<br/><br/>I'm aiming an arrow at my friend, because I've been Charmed and told to attack them. They're backing away towards a lever and saying, "Hey, I'm your friend! Don't shoot; I'm just going to pull this level here, OK?" <br/><br/>I'm accumulating "damage" against them and getting ready to shoot.<br/><br/>Then some instant effect happens which breaks the Charm spell - suddenly all becomes to clear to me and the illusion is dispelled! <br/><br/>How do we decide whether I "shoot" or not? Is the Charmed persona in control (as would be the case if I had not been charmed - presumably the game would be biased towards always giving me a chance to shoot, regardless of interruptions, for this rule to work at all)? Or is the player in perfect control, just deciding to "take the free action" or not as suits them, regardless of the character's interests, inclinations, or instincts?</p></div></blockquote>\n(Charm Person as written does not cause people to shoot their friends, but let's ignore that for now.)<br/><br/>In 3rd edition D&amp;D the readied action to shoot "if anybody tries anything" (I assume as a matter of course that the aiming archer is on a hair trigger) would trigger at the instant dispel, allowing the archer to take their shot first. In 4th edition D&amp;D the archer wouldn't even need to pre-declare their trigger, the player could just decide to take their immediate interrupt action whenever they felt like it.<br/><br/>My own game also recognizes the concept of readying an action, so same thing there. The only question would be whether the archer realizes that the dispel is occurring - if they do not, then the dispeller has indeed managed to save their friend from the nigh-inevitable doom of the archer's eye. I imagine that the archer would continue focusing on their shot, only to realize at some point that they've forgotten why, exactly, they were going to shoot their friend. After that it's on the player - will they take the shot now that they've got it lined up (I mean, those archery instincts can be a bitch, would be a shame to waste such a good shot), or will they carefully lower the bow and do something else instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464382/#Comment_464382" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-27T18:49:26+00:00" title="June 27, 2017  6:49PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I want to be careful otoh.

This means that players will often possess OOC information that they cannot legitimately use as a basis for decision-making. I don't go out of my way to tell them stuff that their characters don't know, but I do not hide it either, and we can generally run anything out in the open if it's the best way to maintain rigid adherence to procedure and firm trust.<br/><br/>I imagine this to mean that our group would totally run with the idea of playing out a combat just like this. It would start something like this:<br/><br/><b>GM:</b> OK, something you should know, guys: your characters are being traced by the Yellow Hand gangsters, and they're blow-pipe assassins. Right now, as you're sitting at the tavern planning your next heist, one of them is scoping out the Paladin - wants him dead. He's got a long blow-pipe readied under the cover of a cloak at the next table over, and he's aiming for a kill. He's totally covert, and you don't know about it. In case you're wondering, I rolled earlier to establish that they got the trace on you, and you've been in one place for two hours now, so they had plenty of time to get their assassin from his waiting spot over here.<br/><b>Player:</b> I guess Paladins in this campaign don't have the "Sense Assassin" skill that Humakti get in Glorantha? Darn. Nothing we can do about this right away, as we don't know about it, right?<br/><b>GM:</b> Yeah, I'm just telling this to you because this is going to get a bit complex, and we want to do all the rolls out in the open. The assassin is taking Aim actions, which basically means that he's going to be piling up damage against you over the next few combat rounds, until he's ready to shoot. Very dangerous, it's a near certain death if he succeeds consistently. He'll be rolling against your AC-10 because you're an unaware target. Meanwhile, think on what you could possibly do, considering your lack of awareness of the danger - reactive Wits checks are a possibility at least, so as to notice the assassin before he's ready to fire.<br/><b>Another player:</b> I'm going to take a +2 to my roll because I'm the one who's constantly making bar runs for the crew; I might spot the assassin's suspiciousness simply due to a different point of view.<br/><b>Yet another rules-lawyer:</b> Just give us a luck roll of some sort, I'm not convinced that the Fates watching over the Paladin are just going to let this happen. Plus, you'll need to give a penalty to the assassin for aiming in a crowded tavern, in a subterfuge setup like that. And a 1/20 chance that we'll simply end our meeting before he's ready to shoot - not very likely, but it could happen. Aside from those details, I think that passive awareness checks are pretty much our only hope - we were stupid to leave ourselves exposed like this, I should've know that the Yellow Hand would try something of the sort.<br/><br/>Something like that, basically the players know what's going on while their characters are severely limited by their lack of situation awareness. Thinking about this, I would probably fine-tune the aiming thing a bit myself to make it slightly more exciting: the shooter needs to be able to lose their amassed damage total by fumbling on any of their attack rolls, at least. It might also be more exciting if the damage dice were not actually rolled before the shot is taken - you'd know how many dice worth you've got, but you don't know if it's enough to take down the target. Of course not knowing the target's HP total works towards the same uncertainty already.<br/><br/>But in general, yeah - seems good to me. This might have something to do with the fact that we do a lot of our "gaming" on the strategic level. If the adventures <b>have</b> an enemy, and that enemy <b>has</b> the resources to arrange a covert hit, and the PCs <b>make</b> it easy to snipe them, then as far as this sandbox campaign is concerned, they're getting what they asked for if an ambush assault or a lone sniper drops on them rather unfairly. That's precisely what a "strategic loss" looks like in practice, you stumble into a tactical situation that's been carefully arranged by your foe to make for a near-guaranteed loss.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464385/#Comment_464385" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-27T20:33:55+00:00" title="June 27, 2017  8:33PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Our campaign accepts a large amount of player/character disassociation as the price of fluid wargaming.</p></div></blockquote>\n<p>We have a couple of players who are really good at this but several players who continue to baffle me with how they can\u2019t handle this.</p>\n<p>In these examples, player X is different between the examples (yes, I have several players who act this way) and so are player Y.</p>\n<p>Player X finds out that PC Y killed NPC Z (and keeping it a secret from PC X)?</p>\n<p>And PC Y and NPC Z have had lots of contact but PC X has never bother to visit NPC Z before?
