In a world where the deep edges of the map are increasingly colored in, what else is out there? Is there anything out there? I personally have this tension with Cryptozoology: I want them to fucking <i>find</i> the Sasquatch &amp; the Loch Ness monster, y'know? Because that would be awesome. But I also kind of love that maybe there are things out there that we haven't found and will never find, right under our noses.<br/><br/>Cryptozoology also lives in tension with science. It's not a science, but if it actually finds something, "Science" takes it away and brings it into its domain.<br/><br/>So, what would the game look like? I dunno, but those are the themes I'd want to play with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386827/#Comment_386827" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-10T10:51:55+00:00" title="August 10, 2012 10:51AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hans - so are you interested in the "looking for something that might not exist, discovering things about yourself and your partners, finding some questionable evidence, but ultimately not finding the ...thing... you were looking for" story?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386828/#Comment_386828" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-10T10:55:28+00:00" title="August 10, 2012 10:55AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thing that intrigues me is the notion that you can be obsessive about it, and devote your life to it, and never <i>know. </i> I'd make a game where the truth was always ambiguous and beyond your grasp, and the longer you pursued it the crazier it made you.

I think if it's not actually possible to do what the characters are setting out to do, then there's no tension to the search. Or, I guess: I don't think you're ever actually going to <i>capture</i> it, but you might find evidence enough that proves its existence to you. Hm. I dunno. My idea isn't very fleshed out.<br/><br/>Jason's ideas are good, too.<br/><br/>It almost seems like three related games, here:<br/><br/>1. Looking, not finding, mystery, self-discovery game<br/>2.

Having just found a cryptid, what now?<br/><br/>Jason - It'd be neat to have a procedure that uses a bunch of tags to generate the cryptid but then you deconstruct the cryptid you've made to generate the 'convincing' evidence that you find along the way.  Like, you'd use the detail 'mangy fur' to help you design your chupacabra but then when you go looking, you find bits of mangy fur, thus confirming your belief in its existance.  The circular logic of such a mechanism strikes me as particularly appropriate.  That could also create a game timer - the game ends when you've found all this evidence which 'proves' the cryptid's existance (though you still haven't found it).  <br/><br/>Introducing extra tags later could spark debate among the <del>PCs</del> experts - a feather, chupacabra don't have feathers - what if they do - but they don't! - maybe they eat something with feathers? - I'm writing a paper about how they have feathers - etc..<br/><br/>The way information about cryptids is transmitted is also interesting - personal journals, documentaries, conventions, books, "papers" in "scientific journals", transcripts of calls to 911, etc.  It'd be cool if the game generated some sort of faux cryptozoological document.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386831/#Comment_386831" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-10T11:15:25+00:00" title="August 10, 2012 11:15AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It might help to look at (non-horror) fiction that deals with cryptids.

Have everyone write yes or no on a 3x5 card and place it face down. This is their vote as to if the cryptid exists. The goal of the players that vote no is to get the other players to spend more resources than they do. They have to be convincing or they'll be ferreted out. No one player can find the cryptid by themselves but working together they will all attempt to spend as little as possible but still do what they can to find the creature.<br/><br/>Once some threshold is reached, the cards are flipped. If the no votes win, the search is a bust and all resources spent are lost. If the yeses spent more than the no votes, the no votes win having not ruined their lives. If the yes votes win the creature is found and they are showered with praise and fame.<br/><br/>Edit: the no votes have to have a compelling advantage to say no and be party poopers. Something like they get praise and fame by exposing the other players as charlatans and frauds. I guess it really depends on if this is a one shot or a continuing game. The next game, maybe they start off with more resources and better reputation?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387451/#Comment_387451" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-18T22:59:14+00:00" title="August 18, 2012 10:59PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Good observations, Hans!
