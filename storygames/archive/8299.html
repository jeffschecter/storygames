You can use it as a learning tool, an extended example, or they might be entertaining in their own right.<br/><br/>I'd like to hear from our Japanese-culture-savvy contingent to get a better feel for the purpose replays serve, and I also want to talk in general about the value of the extended example.  <br/><br/>I'm thinking, for my current project, of including a replay, with links in the text to points where the current topic is illustrated.  So you'd get a very clean presentation of procedural information, with notes saying "to see how this shakes out at the table, go to page 7 of the replay where Joel is tempting Jeff into narrative failure when he mechanically wants success."<br/><br/>As a way to organize information, does this seem useful or appealing?  Does a substantial and complete example of play seem like something you'd value, particularly beyond an initial reading?  Good examples in RPGs in English?  Bad ones?<br/><br/>Replays!

In my case, the 'replay' follows the game text almost precisely, so instead of seeing a "go to page 7" you'd already be on the page that describes how it happens in play.<br/><br/>Or are you talking about, not so much a transcript of a play session, as a portrayal of the fiction created by the play session? If so, <b>Fastlane</b> doesn't have that so much. All I made was a transcript of the actual session, the interactions of the players, and so on. That said, integrating an example into a portrayal of the fiction is very intriguing.<br/><br/>What are you talking about? A transcript of a play session, or a fictionalization of a play session's story?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183204/#Comment_183204" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-13T12:58:44+00:00" title="December 13, 2008 12:58PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I skip the examples in rpgs consistently. So consistently in fact, that I don't even realize that they're there anymore. I only ever make an exception when the main text is so incomplete that it simply can't be parsed. <i>In a Wicked Age</i>, for instance.<br/><br/>That being said, I sometimes enjoy the play fiction on my second read-through of some games. Can't remember any names right now, but I seem to remember that some game I read recently had some mildly amusing verbal stuff... ah, it was <i>Heroquest</i>! Heroquest has pretty interesting examples because they're funny, opinionated and form a greater whole that'd be called a replay if it were all collected together instead of being dispersed in the book. I just took my copy of Heroquest home after it spent a couple of years in Helsinki, and while I wasn't interested in reading the rules, I read through all the examples on my way home. That was some wacky shit, the designer seemed to think that the game'd be played by old-school adventure roleplayers.<br/><br/>So my call would be that I'd do a replay only for artistic purposes, not to teach rules or procedures. Doing the latter through a replay is like teaching sciences in school by showing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procidis" rel="nofollow">Procidis</a> animations - perhaps entertaining, but ultimately futile and inefficient. Say what you want to say in a direct and structured manner, if you're going to say it at all.

People absorb information in different ways, and it's often easier to demonstrate certain concepts than it is to explain them.  What reads as convoluted and esoteric as a series of steps might be perfectly clear when you read about it in practice.<br/><br/>I skip examples too, only referencing them if I can't understand the procedural instruction - and then they better be helpful, because the text has already failed me on one level.  I think examples are a good place to communicate "this is what I think a good session should <i>feel </i>like" as well.<br/><br/>Alexander, I'm talking about a transcript - from what I've seen they read more like scripts, with "stage directions" or diagrams indicating mechanical interactions.  I'm open to correction from our Japanophiles.  Examples I write tend to take this format anyway, but in the past I've broken them up throughout the book and I'm considering not doing that next time.  It would suit <i>me</i>, as a reader, to have the crunchy bits all up front, and a colorful long example in the back that was both informative and fun to read, but I want to talk about it and weigh the possibilities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Burr" title="Burr"><img alt="Burr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Burr">Burr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183233/#Comment_183233" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-13T16:27:55+00:00" title="December 13, 2008  4:27PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wouldn't be able to follow most indie rpg texts without procedural examples.  I need to switch between rules text and examples to figure out exactly what the other is talking about.<br/><br/>I listened to the full transcript of the D&amp;D 4e Penny Arcade.  It had anticipation and amusement going for it back when it first aired.  However, I still couldn't pay close attention much of the time.  The most useful moments were when the GM interrupted the "normal" session to give rhyme and reason for the system, its mechanics, his techniques, etc.  Or rather, those were the moments when the transcript as a whole seemed most useful.  The moments themselves wouldn't have been as <i>ding!</i> outside the broader context.<br/><br/>So I think you could have a rules text interrupted by relevant examples, or a transcript interrupted by explanations, the optimum being somewhere between.  I'd stick closer to the former.  With a transcript, a discussion of what's possible may be railroaded.  If you say one thing is possible, but all the rest of your transcript is dependent on what actually happened in that session, then what's actually transcribed may be what your game seems to be really <i>for</i>.<br/><br/>Ah, but then, maybe that's just lack of imagination on my part.  A little experimentation probably wouldn't hurt, after all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183239/#Comment_183239" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-13T16:48:45+00:00" title="December 13, 2008  4:48PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As someone who routinely reads transcripts of what he says, don't be alarmed if, when you read a transcript, you sound like an idiot.  <i>Everyone sounds like an idiot.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183246/#Comment_183246" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-13T17:26:31+00:00" title="December 13, 2008  5:26PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From my observations, the replays in Japanese RPGs tend to be biased towards either introducing beginners to the game or serving as entertainment. The former is a standard thing in many J-RPG rulebooks, while the latter is published in bunko (Japanese paperback) format. I haven't yet bothered with the latter yet, but I'd imagine they'd be long enough to cover a campaign or a decent chunk thereof. (Magazines like Role&amp;Roll also publish and serialize replays).<br/><br/>The introductory replay in Maid RPG is good for showcasing the random-event-driven style of play, but I'm not sure it's all that great for much else. The introductory replay in Yuuyake Koyake (that other game by the same designer) has little asides that explain the rules, and is aimed at giving the GM/narrator a more complete understanding of how to go about things, both in terms of the GM's job and the game's unusual style. (This being a non-violent game about helping people and making friends, in which a session normally involves one to three NPCs).<br/><br/>I am genuinely curious (and maybe Andy could shed some light on this?) how effective introductory replays really are. Not all J-RPGs have them (F.E.A.R. doesn't bother with them in any of their rulebooks, for example), and I wonder how much of their inclusion is just because of what's become convention.<br/><br/>Oh, also, what do you think of the example dialogues in Bliss Stage?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183247/#Comment_183247" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-13T17:31:32+00:00" title="December 13, 2008  5:31PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there are some distinctions to be made hereabouts.

An example is a made up transcript designed to explicate or clarify some procedure of play. I see replays potentially adding at least three additional elements:<br/><br/>1) They're supposed to be entertaining in their own right<br/>2) They show how to play the game better, i.e. focus on technique rather than procedure<br/>3) They provide a snapshot of the culture* of the game<br/><br/>I see all these things in the Maid replays, for example, and I don't see them happening much in rules examples.<br/><br/>* By culture I guess I mean something like social contract + humor / inside jokes / tribal geekiness                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183253/#Comment_183253" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-13T18:24:02+00:00" title="December 13, 2008  6:24PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 13, 2008 6:28PM by John_Harper.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't believe you people skip examples.

Specifically, it starts with a big combat example, because players of the first edition were always asking how to do big battles, but she didn't expect that would really be a major part of most games.  In that specific case, then, using the example to demonstrate how the rules worked in certain situations (battles) actually ended up working against the goal of showing players how play was normally expected to go.  That illustrates, I think, how complicated it can be to come up with examples that really do what you want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183281/#Comment_183281" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-14T00:13:35+00:00" title="December 14, 2008 12:13AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is always the option of playing your game in its final incarnation, but before finishing the text... and when you get that really awesome session that is exactly what you want it to be (some of you people seem to manage that with depressing regularity...), transcribe that. <br/>\n<br/>\nSure, that means recording all your sessions..

An actual transcript would read so differently from a synthetic example and would probably hit many of the social contract/cultural touchstones that Tony mentioned.  Because I'm really interested in supporting procedural information, I'm much more inclined to make up my replay out of whole cloth, to make sure it hits the points I want to hit very succinctly.  I've certainly fabricated all my examples in the past, informed by play but not reflecting anything that actually happened at the table accurately.

On the other hands games like DiTV and Amber has got my attention.  I think this might be that in my gaming development when I hit Amber (11 years ago) and DiTV (more recently) they were trying to do something I hadn't encountered before.  So the examples were vital to helping me get my head around some new ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have certainly used some of the Amber ones to give my players an idea of how the game works - because it is diceless and all done on stat comparison the GM is giving the players clues as to the strength of their opponent through the description, it isn't just flavour, if you ignore it you might end up losing big time.  That takes a bit of a shift in perspective for some folks and the examples help with that (I think - it is a while since I read them!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think if you are trying to do something interesting with your game which  might involve changing how people think about playing/GMing then examples are vital.  Now I see how this could be an amazing place for giving really great GMing tips on how to establish atmosphere or smoothly incorporate another player's ideas into the developing plot or even how to deal with difficult situations such as a player who hogs the limelight.<br/>\n<br/>\nHmmm - maybe I need to go back and re-read some of my old RPGs.  The examples sections might have been holding some gems of GMing advice I could have used!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380314/#Comment_380314" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-31T02:40:42+00:00" title="May 31, 2012  2:40AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find edited transcripts of actual play involving the designer very useful, in part because they show the assumptions that the designer is making, sometimes unware, about the game which are not transmitted or covered by the text. For example if the system does not resolve a certain situation, and suggests that the GM or players usual social means, and the example shows how this might be done, the replay has high value.

It occurs to me that they are probably easier to deal with than transcribing audio of actual play.  I'm guessing that some appropriate art and formatting would make replays pretty pleasurable reading.  If I were going to include one in a game I'd include it as an appendix and, in the PDF, hyperlink the crap out of it as Jason suggests (rule/technique to example and vice versa).  In a book, I think I'd want the names of the players to be changed so that I wasn't distracted by knowing of them.  As a separate thing (e.g. a kickstarter bonus, a collection, a chapbook) the replay would gain value if I recognized one or more of the players (e.g. the designer, a podcast crew, other notable personages).  For session games with shared elements, I'd love to see a collection of replays bound together.  For example, I'd totally read a replay collection for Lady Blackbird, Kagematsu, Mountain Witch, or Ghost/Echo to see how other people worked with the same material.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380332/#Comment_380332" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-31T08:23:55+00:00" title="May 31, 2012  8:23AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Damn.

Okay, so the button to create an account is in Japanese, but the page it leads you to is in English.<br/><br/>Go here:<br/><a href="https://secure.nicovideo.jp/secure/register" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://secure.nicovideo.jp/secure/register</a><br/><br/>Then check out this video series: Someone took a replay for a Japanese RPG called DoubleCross, and recreated the entire thing in a Dating Sim engine for display purposes, including fully "vocaloid" (simulated human) speech.<br/><br/>Part 1 of 10: The pre-play talk:<br/><a href="http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm16299492" rel="nofollow">http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm16299492</a><br/>Part 2 of 10: Talking about the setting and making characters:<br/><a href="http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm10138484" rel="nofollow">http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm10138484</a><br/>Part 4 of 10: Actual play begins:<br/><a href="http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm16529261" rel="nofollow">http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm16529261</a><br/><br/>And some folks also use this "Dating Sim Engine for Replay" like as Arpie made in this Praxis thread over here, for Pedagogy, and explaining the workings of the game:<br/><a href="http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm16027473" rel="nofollow">http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm16027473</a><br/><br/>Arpie's thread on Ren'Py:<br/><a href="http://story-games.com/praxis/comments.php?DiscussionID=558" rel="nofollow">http://story-games.com/praxis/comments.php?DiscussionID=558</a> </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380333/#Comment_380333" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-31T08:45:47+00:00" title="May 31, 2012  8:45AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2012 8:46AM by mease19.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There should totally be a replay contest where the winner get's [scenes from] his/her replay acted out at a convention.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400801/#Comment_400801" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-14T08:22:02+00:00" title="December 14, 2012  8:22AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ewen did it.

They usually give an impression how and when the designer intends his rules to be used and might make things clear I was confused about before. The last time examples really helped me were in A Dirty World. They tought me how to use the mechanics in intellectual and social conflicts not just physical, which is a big part of the game. Those were longer examples but not a whole game session.<br/>I listen to actual play podcasts regulary and find them greatly entertaining.

I usually prefer it as bite sized chucks that go along with rule descriptions that give flavor and example applied narrative to the mechanics. Dogs in the Vineyard does this well. With games that have a heavy theme I really love having the text peppered with micro short stories and even the occasional longer one. For long replays as you are talking about I much prefer audio podcasts of actual play. It would be great if new rpg games all had Actual Play podcast on there website that you could download.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard" title="EpistolaryRichard"><img alt="EpistolaryRichard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard">EpistolaryRichard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400852/#Comment_400852" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-14T13:02:51+00:00" title="December 14, 2012  1:02PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 14, 2012 1:03PM by EpistolaryRichard.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Ewen did it.
