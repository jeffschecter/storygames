It is highly desired that the product be in PDF or extremely cheap.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I have played so far:<br/>\n<br/>\n-Burning Wheel<br/>\n-Burning Empires<br/>\n-Dogs in the Vineyard<br/>\n-In A Wicked Age<br/>\n-Poison'd<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I'm thinking about getting:<br/>\n<br/>\n-PTA<br/>\n-Grey Ranks<br/>\n-Agon<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not sure about Agon.  I know it's competitive and my group isn't exactly Gamist.  The theme sounds stellar though so I'm torn.  I'd also really like to pick up Carry but without a PDF available I'd have to sacrifice $20 for a game I may only play once.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what are the absolutely essential Indie games out there that I'm missing?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Burr" title="Burr"><img alt="Burr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Burr">Burr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152305/#Comment_152305" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-22T19:33:03+00:00" title="June 22, 2008  7:33PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't Rest Your Head -- An excellent game that would fill an empty niche in your current collection, and for $7.95 you can get two PDFs (one full version and one stripped down version) via their <a href="http://www.evilhat.com" rel="nofollow">website</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152318/#Comment_152318" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-22T21:10:33+00:00" title="June 22, 2008  9:10PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I suspect everyone's going to chime in with their favourite games, but here's my pick:<br/><br/>The most use I've got out of an indie PDF has been "The Mountain Witch".

My group is similarly not really competitive but still had some great games. The thing I like is that the competition between the heroes can be dialled up or down depending on how the group likes it. For us, the dial started pretty low but started creeping up as people figured out ways to mess with each other to get the glory, and this happened naturally and without and lessening of fun (or hurt feelings).<br/><br/>I'd also vote for <i>Hero's Banner</i> as another one to check out - especially if you liked <i>In A Wicked Age</i>. They have some similarities in the way play fits together (short, related chapters, fairly open scope), but <i>Hero's Banner</i> focuses on a different kind of story (the coming of age of heroes). Plus there's a neat element of seeing how your heroes change the world as the generations pass.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152356/#Comment_152356" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T02:42:44+00:00" title="June 23, 2008  2:42AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Charles, what sort of thing do you like?

It's a secret world horror game.  Where there's a really real reality hiding behind or in between the places of our regular reality.  Like the movie Dark City or the novel/tv series Neverwhere.  Everything is "scary" not in terms of dread or panic, but it terms of it being off or wrong.  Like American McGee's Alice's rendition of Alice in Wonderland.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152718/#Comment_152718" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-24T11:17:24+00:00" title="June 24, 2008 11:17AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            noclue and M Eryesen are both right.

I would agree that its hard to do away with the GM in DRYH, but you can give the players as much narrative control as you find in a bog standard PTA game very easily--If the player wins the role, they can take narrative control and describe their success. If Pain dominates, the GM gets to pee in their cheerios, narrating how the victory they just narrated leads them further into suffering and misery.
