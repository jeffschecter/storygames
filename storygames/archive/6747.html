We talked about maybe just using Reign's system as is, but I wanted something different.<br/><br/>So, here it is: <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/dnd4/dnd4e_groupactions.pdf" rel="nofollow">A system for group-level actions in D&amp;D 4e</a>. (PDF)<br/><br/>Check out the 1-page PDF and let me know what you think. The basic idea is that your group is created like a character, and it can fight other groups on the "group battle board." You give your group actions by completing encounters at the PC-scale (much like you do in Burning Empires).<br/><br/>So, the Company of the Raven raids a goblin cult of Orcus, and you play out that encounter with the PCs. Then, based on what happened in the encounter, the players get to do a "group move" on the group battle board, and attack the Orcus Cult enemy group, or go defensive and grab some "cover," or acquire a better group-level weapon, or whatever. The group-scale character can level up and get new abilities and stuff, too.<br/><br/>The GM might want to make a custom group battle board with interesting terrain to represent the nature of the conflict between the groups (like zones that give attack bonuses because of attracting followers or whatever).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149781/#Comment_149781" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T14:24:53+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  2:24PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2008 2:25PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How do you plan to extend the metaphor - what does terrain represent?

Or is it literally just the name of their party and the group battle is to see what effect on the world their adventuring has?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149786/#Comment_149786" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T14:32:09+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  2:32PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Suggestions:  If the group is larger than the PCs, then I would create a character for each aspect of the group that maps out to the class roles.  "The Talon Force Commando Squad" represents the companies attack force and is portrayed by a "striker" character.  "The merchanits guild of Analang" is where the company receives most of its funding and is portrayed as a "controller" character, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the group is just the party...then I'd just use the party characters right on the battle board, with the opposition represented by the enemies key Lieutenants and henchmen.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd scatter "actions" around the adventure like APs (or even use APs).  By doing different things in the adventure, the players earn APs.

No, the Company is not in any way an Elf -- we're just using those mechanics.<br><br>One on one fighting may not be super interesting, which is fine. The real game is still the PC-level stuff, of course. The group fight just gives us a super clear structure for determining when the Cult of Orcus is defeated or run off. It would be badwrong if the group battle was more interesting than the PC encounters.<br><br>In our setting, the Company is a small group of mercs (maybe 12?) who serve as the elite strike team for the Raven Queen (in our world, the gods are present and real). The players are in charge of the Company, and they draw adventuring teams from the roster as needed (we rotate players and GMs so this helps us).                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149789/#Comment_149789" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T14:37:52+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  2:37PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, have you read the Firefight rules from Burning Empires?

What if they made a character based on their crew and, y'know, put in on the map next to your crew's meta-character... and you fought the cult of Orcus together?<br/><br/>You see where I'm going with this?  You've just invented a really cool way to do "Living Orcus Hunters," with a bunch of different play groups all cooperating on a meta-campaign that incrementally moves along.  So, for example, your crew could take out a critical Orcus sanctum that would basically count as an "Aid Another" action on Judd's crew's attempt to stick it to the Demon Prince by disrupting attempts to raise an undead army (which could be an attack or a use of a "campaign" -- i.e. encounter on a meta level -- attack power).  Yeah?<br/><br/>By reading the AP of each other's play too, you could easily share reoccuring villains or locations.  Or, if you don't want to tie what one play group is doing to what another is doing, you could declare that you're actually fighting the cult of Orcus across multiple planes / realities at the same time, unknowingly working together.  In either case, throwing down mega-crossover adventures at conventions (GenCon, Dreamation) where members of different playgroups assault Orcus together would be mega cool.<br/><br/>The only problem would be, what if one campaign dies or slows down while another campaign keeps chugging along every week, gaining one "meta-turn" for each encounter completed.  So you might have to figure out how to adjust it for differing rates of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149861/#Comment_149861" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T17:48:09+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  5:48PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude.<br/><br/>Yes please.<br/><br/>(I've been chatting with Judd about our parallel games.
