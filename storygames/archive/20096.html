Interesting. Er, no it isn\u2019t.\n<blockquote>Also, tell us why we should be excited about this!</blockquote>\nSomebody asked me whether indyhippo was a publisher, or a game dev group, or a source of advice for designers etc., and my response to him will I think serve as the response to your question here, so following is my (slightly edited) reply:<br/><br/>The indyhippo community started as a place to dump info about my GIPs, but then I thought why not make it open to everyone to join in, talk about gaming, talk about their own projects (if they're fellow designers), and generally hang out? <br/><br/>indyhippo itself has a similar ethos: I aim for it to be not merely a publishing imprint and outlet for my games, but also a focus of innovative and socially conscious game design, similar in its perspective to that of other designers such as Avery Mcdaldno. <br/><br/>The tagline of this community - working on something different - is related to the overall indyhippo motto, saying something different, i.e. thinking outside the box, mixing things up a bit, not simply churning out endless micro variations of previous games, which is what I see a lot of around me. <br/><br/>So I want to encourage other designers to think ouside the box, to provide a space where they can share ideas and get support, and possibly even collaborate with each other. You'll see in the intro section that I acknowldedge that a game is never the result of only one person's efforts, but rather an agglomeration of the contributions of many different folks. <br/><br/>I also want to encourage 'open source' game design, or design by forum, where external contributions to a project are invited and made welcome right from the start.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444086/#Comment_444086" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-15T17:17:59+00:00" title="March 15, 2015  5:17PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 15, 2015 5:18PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, this should totally be your theme song: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_v5FNTa3VE" rel="nofollow">Flight of the Cosmic Hippo</a>.
