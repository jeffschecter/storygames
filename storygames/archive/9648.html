With a good 30 or so starters, it looked like it could be a fun challenge.<br/><br/>For the past 2 months I've been working away on this project...taking some old concepts I've been working with, refining them, playtesting a couple of times, refining further, writing two hundred stanzas or so of poetry in the pseudo-conventions of a Sanskrit epic, compiling a few dozen illustrations and then trying to lay out the result in the time I had left.<br/><br/>All the while watching many of the other entrants in the contest withdraw due to lack of time. I almost gave up myself when getting a new job during the duration of the contest, but they say pressure makes diamonds.<br/><br/>I'm reasonably happy with my result, but there are certainly a few more refinements I'd like to make after a few more rounds of playtesting.<br/><br/>For those who might be interested here is <a href="http://vulpine.110mb.com/RSR_A4_sml_bw.pdf" rel="nofollow">Rajah Spiny Rat</a>.<br/><br/>Enjoy.<br/><br/>Offer feedback (anything would be appreciated).<br/><br/><span style="color: #FF0000;">V</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214330/#Comment_214330" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-25T09:28:54+00:00" title="June 25, 2009  9:28AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Michael: I've read your game through once, and I have some basic comments. These are based on a single read-through, and so some of them might be things I would change my mind about on future reads.<br/><br/>So, let's go!<br/><br/>1.Great style; I love the look of this book, which includes art.<br/>2. The font you've picked for the titles and the poems is nice... when it's big. when it's smaller, like in the poetry section, it's tough enough to read that I just didn't bother. I really enjoyed the poems when I read them, but I couldn't justify the extra effort.<br/>3. Some of your layout choices are perhaps not ideal. Specifically: columns would be nice. Your pages tend to have 22-25 words per line, and at least one line in the book has 30 words. That's a lot of eye-scrolling. By comparison Lady Blackbird and Swashbucklers of the Seven Skies (two pdfs I had on the laptop when I read yours) generally have 15 words per line, broken into two-column pages. Secondly, having multiple sidebars per page can make the page seem cluttered. Thirdly, a landscape A4 format seems to be a really unorthodox choice if you ever plan on making this a print product. Consider a more standard page size (although landscape is still cool; it ensures the pages stay open).<br/>4. I really love your artwork choices; they really present the feel of the game clearly.<br/>5. Character creation is very cool, and follows a recognizable progression. I would probably say the part about getting 12 creation points first, though, since you can spend those points on Race and Caste, as well as Paths.<br/>6. The focus on keeping the conflicts in settlements again ties nicely to the theme, and also "humanizes" the action is a nice, subtle way.<br/>7. Some rules description issues: When a player rolls dice, the Author rolls dice and they subtract successes; I get from the examples that this is a contested roll, but you just say "this is a contested roll" without clearly establishing what that means. Your earliest descriptions of the rolling particularly are confusing. Also, what happens if an Avatar searches for story and th Author gets more successes? The Avatar finds nothing and the game halts?<br/>8. I like that Detailed Resolution uses a "yes, but" structure, but you need to come right out and -say- that. As far as I can tell, there's no clear description of how that interplay should take place, although the examples are good. Talking about the rules and the gameplay at the same time, rather than in the separated way you have might make this a clearer, tighter mechanic. That said, I love the back-and-forth fact-bidding.<br/>9. The structure of your Turn sequence means players don't interact much with each other, it seems, but just with the Author. This will lead to long downtimes for each player, which can cause erosion of focus. Characters need to be able to cooperate to keep them all invested in every scene. Also, since a Rest Scene needs to be unanimous, it's actually advantageous to play with fewer players so that you can call a rest when you need one, instead of waiting for holdouts who don't mind risking your character.<br/>10. Is it really necessary to have the Conflict and Combat section be a different section from the Story Resolution? The mechanic appears the same, at least on first-read, so why not integrate this and save some pages?<br/>11. Game terms in the text could stand to be bolded, underlined, or otherwise called-out. Skimming the text it's too easy to miss them.<br/>12. Town building rules are cool, quick, and again tie nicely into the theme. Some more detail about how to develop Plots and tie them to towns might be nice.<br/>13. Character sheets are nice, stylish, and seem well-laid-out.<br/>14. Sanskrit terms glossary and names sheet are a major plus. You might want to mention that they are at the back, because I spent the whole time reading thinking "I hope he puts a glossary and names list in this".<br/><br/>Overall, I think you have a good game here, that could use a few tweaks for clarity and has some layout issues. I hope this helps!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214439/#Comment_214439" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-25T20:09:57+00:00" title="June 25, 2009  8:09PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for that initial feedback, it's exactly the stuff I need to hear.<br/><br/>You've made a couple of valid points that I had seriously started to worry about toward the end of the design process, and you've raised a couple of issues that I hadn't really thought about. But since this was a competition entry, I'm happy with what I achieved given the ingredients and the timeframe.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Concerns about Layout</span><br/><br/>I came up with the layout concept at around the same time that there was a discussion on layout here on storygames. The justification for my final choice came from a few factors. The first of which was that I wanted the book to present with an exotic (almost scroll-like feel), to give players the idea that this was something a bit different to what they were used to. Secondly, I wanted the rules of the game to unfold at the same pace of the poem. I laid out what rules I wanted to reveal, and at what stages they should appear (and roughly how much detail to give them), with this framework I wrote the poem.<br/><br/>Then I wrote up the current version of rules...not realising that some rule sections might end up short compared to the poem while other parts of the rules were more complex and ended up crammed on the page.<br/><br/>Sidebars were used as an option to break things up a bit and highlight some key concepts. I didn't like the pages with multiple sidebars, so you're right there...I'm definitely going to change this in the next revision.<br/><br/>I'm seriously considering the idea of having paired pages, with poetry on the left page and rules on the right (probably still with the landscape orientation). It'll blow out the page count, but will give more room for images, better layout for the rules (which will be in two columns on the page), and more room for some in-play descriptions.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rules</span><br/><br/>I'm glad you like the character generation system, it's something I'm refining for my major background project.<br/><br/>As for the concerns raised...I hadn't even considered the idea that the game might stop if players try to encounter a story through their avatars but fail to do so. I've just been running with this as an opportunity to inject atmosphere and colour into a settlement before the stories do kick in. I guess I need to make this clearer in the rules. As a secondary option, I was going to have the players able to choose which plot they encountered if they were successful on this type of roll, but they would be subjected to a plot of the author's choosing if they failed.<br/><br/>I'd like for each settlement to be a "mini-sandbox", explored and developed by the players, then finally exhausted before moving onto the next settlement. I don't want too much GM/Author intervention here....but it's a concept I'm still trying to refine through playtesting.<br/><br/>You're right that I need to integrate the actions between characters better. As I was writing this, I was in two minds. Initially I had the players guiding their avatars quite separately and distinctly, but I realised that this would disjoint play a bit. So I added the concept of offering dice to one another, either directly contributing (with elements) or indirectly contributing (with the accumulated pool).<br/><br/>Then I started thinking of the idea that these aren't really distinct scenes, instead they are a series of action taken by each character. One players takes their sequence in the lead role (possibly assisted by others), then another player takes their sequence of actions (again with the possibility of assistance). It's an idea I'm conflicted over, but hopefully some good playtesting will lead to a decision.<br/><br/>Conflict and combat are going to be made more different, and they will retain their separate sections. I added in a sidebar an option for increasing tension by rolling dice during the course of a scene. When avatars go head-to-head, or when they face antagonists, dice will be rolled individually as actions are declared (with the possibility of failed actions).<br/><br/>The rest interval notion obviously includes some factors I hadn't considered. But the idea here was that if a player was holding out on a rest interval, then they would have to step up to play out another scene/action-sequence. No-one else would be "risked", they'd just be waiting for that player to finish off their heroics (or stupidity) with their remaining dice.<br/><br/>Good idea about <b>bolding</b> the key game terms, I'll have to make sure I implement that in the next revision.<br/><br/>Finally, you're right about the scant details I gave about how plots might be derived and tied together into towns. I have an instinctive knack for this, and we play games in a fairly freeform manner that evolves organically as the story develops. I have to keep remembering that I'm writing a full game for other people, rather than a set of elaborate reminder notes for myself. <br/><br/>Again, thanks for the initial feedback.<br/><br/><span style="color: #FF0000;">V</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214447/#Comment_214447" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-25T21:33:00+00:00" title="June 25, 2009  9:33PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would love to offer to playtest, but I have playtest packages for <i>Apocalypse World</i> and <i>Microscope</i> plus my own projects, and my group only meets once a week!
