Doing certain horrible stuff results in losing Humanity. Humanity and the actions that breach it are pre-determined.<br/><br/>*Sorcerer is pretty much like that, too, except different levels of Humanity don't directly affect mechanical play, it's just a thematic gauge. Players collectively decide what Humanity means in their game.<br/><br/>*Pendragon. Characters have values such as Chivalry that have some mechanical functions. I don't remember the exact specifics.<br/><br/>*In Burning Wheel you can have Beliefs that are ethical and philosophical standpoints. Acting towards and against a Belief is reflected in the mechanics.<br/><br/>*Keys as seen in TSoY and Lady Blackbird can function in a similar way.<br/><br/>*Dogs in the Vineyard has that as the "fruitful void".

It's a great game to teach you to bring the pain as a game via purely descriptive content. I found it fun at Cons. Way more fun than DitV but less satisfying. <br/><br/>Honestly, it's not so much a game about mortality but a GM training exercise: Can you influence the players without mechanics? Can you turn their desires back on them? Where are the limits and 'fruitful voids' of morality play? I remember a con game where a dad and daughter team (say, 35ish and 13?) brought the nastiest shit but I stymied them with Gray's Anatomy account of a gun-shot wound to the knee. I also think it's where Vincent finds his voice. And fuck, that's important.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310430/#Comment_310430" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-01T13:02:11+00:00" title="February  1, 2011  1:02PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As Gregor mentioned, I think of Pendragon as one of the archetypical games here. Characters position themselves on each of a set of sliding scales, and must make rolls to act against their dispositions. Whether they succeed or fail, their dispositions gradually change to reflect their actions. That's as best as I recall it, anyway - it's been a while. But it can produce some fun situations and nice character arcs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/theg33k" title="theg33k"><img alt="theg33k" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img96.imageshack.us/img96/7043/fil31771.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/theg33k">theg33k</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310434/#Comment_310434" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-01T13:18:30+00:00" title="February  1, 2011  1:18PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for your help, everyone--this is all super-useful and I'm looking into a bunch of systems I hadn't really explored before.
