List the implied characters, and target their best interests at each other.  These aren't PCs, though, these are prominent NPCs that the PCs are aware of.  The PCs are a party, and have to come up with a party concept that is connected to this web somehow (like "we're soldiers defending the city from the corrupt prince" or "we're a cadre of mages working for the corrupt prince to attack the city").  Make your party as normal.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the GM pulls at least 2 cards from the Oracle of Shadow.  These are the ones the PCs don't know about, and again, list the implied characters and point their best interests towards the things in the open (especially the party).<br/><br/>Each session after that involves the players pulling 1 card from the Oracle of Light and adding it to the situation... pointing best interests at something else they know about.  Meanwhile the GM pulls another card from the Oracle of Shadow and points its best interests at something out in the open.<br/><br/>So this way there's always this ... complex obvious situation and something going on in the background.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134760/#Comment_134760" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T22:52:10+00:00" title="March 13, 2008 10:52PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like it!<br/><br/>But why not have a player-created oracle?  A while ago I suggested a thing where the players each write down two things and put them in a hat, and then the GM draws three things out of it.  Every session the players write a new thing each, and the GM draws three things out.  It's player created oracles, but preserving the mystery of what's going on in the background.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
