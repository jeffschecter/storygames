Soon, a big ol' box of fantasy miniatures will arrive at my home.<br/><br/>Yay me!<br/><br/>I've been thinking about building some kind of game to go with them, and I've been thinking about the fun times I had as a kid before I ever learned about RPGs or miniatures wargames.<br/><br/>I'd like to build off those kinds of good experiences, but it has been decades since I played with toys truly like a kid without that gamerthink going on.<br/><br/>So folks, help me out. I know a bunch of you played with action figures and similar toys as kids too.<br/><br/>What are the behaviors/methods/aproaches/unwritten "rules" that you used as kids that made it <b>successful*</b>?<br/><br/>I'm trying to get a handle on that stuff, and use it at the core of some play method for grown adults.<br/><br/>*For right now, i want to avoid discussions of when it went bad and didn't work. That's more of a follow-up topic.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
