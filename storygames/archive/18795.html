I think the pros and cons of virtual gaming match up with the pros and cons of virtual gaming conventions:<br/><br/><b>On the plus side</b><br/><br/>The main advantage is accessibility. You can join no matter where you live. You don't have to travel. You don't even have to wear pants. If you only have a few hours on Saturday for gaming, you can just play in one game and then take care of business or family the rest of the weekend. Beyond "normal" accessibility, there's accessibility for people with special needs. A person with agoraphobia might feel more comfortable playing games online if he or she can do it from her home computer. A wheelchair-bound person doesn't have to deal with the vagaries of physical accessibility in strange places. A person who has seizures doesn't have to worry about an episode in public. A long-term hospital patient can join in the fun.<br/><br/>There's been a lot of much-needed focus on sexual harassment and sexual assault at game conventions lately. Virtual cons still have these problems, I assume, but they're different in nature. <br/><br/>Another plus is tools. Because virtual conventions don't have the physical trappings we often have at regular cons, they replace them with tools: virtual tabletops, dice rollers, wikis or Google Docs, and so on. These tools let you do some things you can't do in person easily: collaborative editing of electronic documents, easier dice rolling (or managed character sheets and computed modifiers), basically unlimited battle maps and figures without the cost, information hiding (show part of a map to one player but not the rest), and so on.<br/><br/>Communication tools online let people break into small groups without the noise of a convention hall. You're not limited to just one comm channel, either. Depending on how you're playing (typing-chat vs. voice-chat vs. video-chat), you might be able to play more than one game at a time (!), if you have the attention span and multitasking ability for it (some do). At the very least, you can be playing in one window while messaging a couple other people on Twitter or G+ or private IM.<br/><br/><b>On the minus side</b><br/><br/>First of all, it's new and weird. That puts a lot of people off the idea. Turn-out may be poor. People don't know how to act online (just act like you would IRL, duh). There will be more fumbling around with the tools and that eats up time. <br/><br/>Speaking of time, virtual play can be slower. If you're playing by text-chat, it'll be 10 times slower than a face-to-face (f2f) game. Voice chat + a virtual tabletop of some kind can be almost as fast as f2f gaming. Video chat basically is like f2f gaming in speed, as you get nonverbal cues from everyone even when they're not talking. That's way more important than you think.<br/><br/>The tools can be tricky. Things that are supposed to just work, sometimes don't. People have different software versions, different network speeds, different hardware. What do you do when one player just falls off the net? Will she be back? When?<br/><br/>While global accessibility is alluring, time zones are a stark reality. Yeah, you can theoretically play with a bunch of people half way around the world, but they're also half a day ahead or behind you. Scheduling games with them might be tricky. If you live in the U.S., you'll probably have lots of people to play with. If you live in Australia, you'll probably be gaming with your countrymates.<br/><br/>Anonymity is arguably a pro but it usually turns out to be a con. People often use anonymity as a way to behave poorly. Most people are fine, but expect a few assholes and have a plan to deal with them.<br/><br/>Finally, the big minus is that it's virtual, not real. There's something really great about human contact: a handshake, a hug, real eye contact, the clinking of glasses after the games are over. There's something amazing about hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of people packed into a building for the sole purpose of gaming. It makes you feel like you belong to something. As a member of a fairly geeky, marginal hobby, it's nice to get together with people who "get it."<br/><br/><br/>I'm excited about the prospects of virtual convention gaming in the future. I haven't attended one of the big events yet, but I hope to do so soon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421368/#Comment_421368" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-11T09:26:08+00:00" title="September 11, 2013  9:26AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2013 9:30AM by catty_big.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Adam, those are some interesting points. I think the big downside for me currently is my weak technology-fu. I've been  struggling intermittently over the last few weeks to get to grips with my wordpress blog, so goodness knows how I'd cope with an online con, but it certainly would increase the availability of con gaming opportunities, the big minus with physical cons being the expenditure of time and money, both in very short supply currently. <br/><br/>I think however that the lack of immediacy would put me off, as would the lack of f2f contact, which is one of the reasons I've been reluctant to try out online gaming hitherto- there's something about the handshake, the whispered joke, the banging of the fist on the table to illustrate how you flatten the orc, plus of course all the socialising in between games. <br/><br/>Also, and I think folks often forget this, there is simply the travelling to a different space for a few days, or even one day. I live in an exceptionally boring East London suburb, and even though I struggle financially to get to cons, I make great efforts to so because then for a few days I'm not in my boring suburb.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421370/#Comment_421370" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-11T09:28:45+00:00" title="September 11, 2013  9:28AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I only played in one game at virtual con once, so take this for whatever that's worth. However, that experience was enough that I haven't wanted to go back. It wasn't that the game or the people were bad, at all. It was simply too remote, too little connection. It felt more like watching a game session or listening to an AP, even when I was participating. It probably didn't help that there was no video.<br/><br/>I can do Hangouts gaming if it's a group of people I know and am invested in, and a game I'm excited about. Even then, it's tough, and it's not as good as it is at the table. If it's people I don't know, it's much harder for me to maintain a sense of connection to the game and a focus. If I can't focus during a game, I know I need to pull out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421371/#Comment_421371" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-11T09:29:20+00:00" title="September 11, 2013  9:29AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you have a decent webcam, headphones, and a mic, you're set.

For example, ConTessa has contests, panels, swag bags (sent out after the con), and a neat little game design contest.  I believe VirtuaCon is having guest hosts/gamers, a lot of electronic prize support, and maybe some kind of online dealer room.  A lot of it is style and how much time the organizers put into the event.  ConTessa/VirtuaCon have some seriously dedicated ring masters.  MC2 is more of a hippy love-in.  :-)<br/><br/>I know MonkeyCon will be around each year because the burn out potential is low.  ConTessa got a lot of love and its selection of YouTube videos gives it a long tail.  VirtuaCon is a crap shoot.  A LOT a work appears to have gone into it.  I hope the pay-off is fantastic since I want to see more events with the various communities out there.<br/>--<br/>TAZ<br/><br/>[Disclaimer:  If it wasn't known earlier, I'm the chief cat herder for MonkeyCon.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421415/#Comment_421415" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-12T08:32:43+00:00" title="September 12, 2013  8:32AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Todd. I was hoping you'd show up here, as I recall you mentioning MonkeyCon earlier.
