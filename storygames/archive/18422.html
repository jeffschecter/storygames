We usually play a game for a few months, and then switch to a new game. If the new game has a GM, we switch GMs. There will usually be a lot of e-mails to get everyone on the same page about the new game. Everyone is usually excited about new fiction and new worlds and new characters, but I've started to notice that new <b>rules</b> do not make the same splash or cause the same excitment. And, in fact, each GM pretty much runs each game "their way" regardless of the rules. It seems like there is an assumption by the other GMs in my group that all games are pretty much the same thing with different analogs. So, I sometimes feel like I'm missing out on an experience that ought to be emerging from the rules. <br/><br/>For example -- we played Dungeon World for a while. And, it was pretty common to hear something like "you enter the dark forrest, roll Discern Realities," or "the Dwarf attacks you, roll hack and slash." My sense of the game (which could certainly be off) is that the correct procedure should have been . . . <br/><br/>GM: You enter a dark forrest, glowing green eyes peer at you from all directions, what do you do? <br/><br/>Player: I . . . (does something in the fiction). <br/><br/>GM: That (fictional thing) triggers (appropriate player move . . . assuming it does trigger a move).<br/><br/>In other words, I didn't think that the GM should EVER be telling players what move they were making BEFORE the player actual performed a fictional action. But, there was a deeply ingrained habit of "you enter the new situation so roll (the equivalent of awareness, perception, initiative)." And there was a deeply ingrained "we're in combat now, so roll the combat roll." The idea of a different procedure was so alien that it didn't ever seem to sink in. The GM moves and principles and agenda may as well have been every other GM section that the GMs typically ignore with a "yeah yeah yeah, I know I know, I've been doing this for years." And the player moves may as well have been any old stat check in a traditional 90s fantasy game.<br/><br/>Similarly, we've started playing Burning Wheel just recently. We made our characters. We chose our Beliefs. We discussed the starting situation so that we could tie our Beliefs into the starting situation, and IMMEDIATELY, in the first session, we ended up shipwrecked on an island so far removed from anything we wrote our Beliefs about that they may as well not be on the sheet. There are weird monsters and awesome treasure on this island, and it's been fun so far, but I feel like we're completely bypassing an important part of the game. We got an an arbitrary amount of Artha at the end of the game as if it was "experience" and it looks like, so far, we're skipping what makes Burning Wheel Burning Wheel (at least as I understand it). <br/><br/>I've been lurking on this website, posting more recently, and listening to gaming podcasts for years, so I've become excited by a lot of the new fangled story gamey concepts. But, I forgot that these concepts are not necessarily intuitive for people who don't think about them all the time, and I'm having trouble explaining that the GM's job is not identical in every game to longtime GMs who are not all that geeky about theoretical stuff. Any ideas for showing new methods to veteran gamers?                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415003/#Comment_415003" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-30T08:10:36+00:00" title="May 30, 2013  8:10AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 30, 2013 8:12AM by noclue.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>For example -- we played Dungeon World for a while.

Is GMing by example an option?<br/><br/>I think you need (mostly) everyone to get on board with the fact that there's a procedural learning curve to learning new games so that you can call out the GM or players for breaking the rules.  I was thinking this would be easier with Dungeon World, since it's more explicit in the text about having a procedure for the GM.  But your BW GM was just handing out Artha without following the rules at all?  I both find this surprising and hard to address.  BW gives players a lot of tools to take control of the narrative if you seize the initiative, and earn lots of mechanical benefits in the process.  But if the Artha economy has been thrown out the window, playing by example isn't on the table anymore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415007/#Comment_415007" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-30T08:34:54+00:00" title="May 30, 2013  8:34AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>Similarly, we've started playing Burning Wheel just recently.

What you are talking about is what I call "conventions". Conventions are not game mechanics, they are HOW you use game mechanics but also HOW you play the game. When to roll dice is often a conventions. Using "Yes, but" is a convention. How you frame a scene is a convention.<br/><br/>Roleplaying games consist usually of three things: game mechanics, setting, and then sometimes there's this weird thing called GM chapter. It's in this chapter where you can find conventions. I would say that this is the wrong way to look at roleplaying games. What you should do is to look at everything as structures, where the conventions, setting and game mechanics all are part of the structures.<br/><br/>The game should tell you EXACTLY how to play out a situation and what kind of situations to play out. What is happening in your group is that the game masters bring their conventions that they've been taught from other game experiences into a new game. This happens because roleplaying games (in general) are sloppy when it comes to enforce conventions into the game. Because they don't shove it up in the readers' faces HOW the game should be played.<br/><br/>The game should tell you how to start the game, how create new situations and how to finish the game. You don't need more than that. Few roleplaying games do this. It seems like they instead rely on the readers to figure it out themselves. I haven't played Burning Wheels but I tried to game master <b>MouseGuard</b> and it totally lacks a good structure to involve the beliefs. It doesn't even do that in it's own adventure with prewritten characters.<br/><br/>My suggestion is to find games that gives structures of play, like <b>InSpectres</b> and <b>Kagematsu</b>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415014/#Comment_415014" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-30T09:10:24+00:00" title="May 30, 2013  9:10AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 30, 2013 9:15AM by noclue.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Well, if everyone is on board with the new situation, I think it could be salvageable.

I cannot overstress how important this is. I get to try new games and see how they are supposed to run. Sometimes, one of my take homes is "Lisa cannot run this one." Seriously, you do NOT want me running Burning Anything or even Mouse Guard. I learn new tricks and new ways to do things. I remember what it's like to be on the other side of the theoretical GM screen, where things aren't as obvious as the GM thinks, where my attention flags if things slow down (for values of slow where the opposite includes the time I was riveted to a discussion between two other characters in a scene my character wasn't in, in a Sorcerer game where a priest and a child were talking about War of the Worlds -- but were totally really talking about power and demons and responsibility).<br/><br/>Read a lot. This includes new games, like Hillfolk, which takes a different approach than I'm used to. It also includes Graham's Stealing Cthulhu, which booted my mind into "Scenarios are parts. Parts can be swapped out. Wait, that means I can..." mode. It includes Phil Vecchione's Never Unprepared, which is teaching me things my subconscious knew but wasn't cluing my consciousness into. It includes online discussions. It also includes books about London in the 1840s and the rest of the century.<br/><br/>Know your limitations. Like I said, I'm not running a Luke Crane game any time soon. That's okay. Other people are doing a fine job of that. I'm not going to absorb all of my books on Victorian England. I can't put in all that details anyway, and shouldn't. Heck, I think my Kerberos Fate game would make 21st century Londoners shake their heads in pitying dismay as they see all the things we get wrong. And I'm not going to get the pre-Belgian Congo right without a lot more work than I'm prepared to put in. I own that. I'm not going to like voting for best roleplayer to see who gets the experience cookie, the single thing in Hillfolk that I dislike. One of my players is moving at the end of the summer, so I want to bring her arc to a good conclusion. This means some of my Lovely Plans will be derailed and my New Lovely Plans will be more imperfect than I'd like. So be it.<br/><br/>Be patient with yourself. You will screw up. This happens. Keep trying.<br/><br/>Talk to your players. This is the most important thing, even more important than playing as not-the-GM. If you cannot or will not communicate with your players -- or vice versa -- there's a serious problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415026/#Comment_415026" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-30T10:38:11+00:00" title="May 30, 2013 10:38AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 30, 2013 7:10PM by Rickard.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>...I'm not sure what the text solution would be.

I haven't read any *World games but Barf forth apocalyptica is a brilliant convention but it's just a convention and those has a tendency to be ignored. My first game consisted mostly by conventions and my experienced was that people ignored them because I put them in a GM chapter and then complained to me when my game (the game mechanics) didn't work with their gaming style. When I talk about structures I mean things like (I'm just throwing together an example now):<br/><br/>CREATE A SCENE<br/>1. Establish the environment by barfing forth apocalyptica.<br/>2. Create a situation by using a [premade list of catastrophes] and also establish who's there.<br/>3. Threaten their beliefs through the situation by [these following means].<br/><br/>That's a structure. That is something that can't be ignored. That's something that will be played out over and over again during the session. If you instead have these three points written in different places in a game book (in the form of GM tips), it's the game that's poorly written.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biffboff" title="biffboff"><img alt="biffboff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/189/nI5NYQDMCBCPG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biffboff">biffboff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415038/#Comment_415038" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-30T12:33:47+00:00" title="May 30, 2013 12:33PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                             "How Do You Teach New Tricks to Old GMs"<br/><br/> My first thought was "lead by example" but in reading over your words I noticed a trend:<br/><br/> "I've noticed a trend in my gaming group that has been frustrating <span style="text-decoration: underline;">me</span>"<br/> "I sometimes feel like <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I'm </span> missing out"<br/> "emphasize the stuff that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I </span> think is missing in our game"<br/> "each GM pretty much runs each game "their way" regardless of the rules"<br/><i></i><br/>  I'm not trying to throw your words back at you.

While your play experience with BW and DW might be (probably not the right world) "suboptimal" by not following the game advice (and having recently read DW, it's pretty clearly laid out around the example of play), if everyone's having fun and you're all still fumbling through how moves work, it's OK. <br/><br/>I think we sometimes think we need to play/run every game perfectly right away, like if we're getting Moves the wrong way round we should just be playing D&amp;D or something.

Do we do that for a reason? Are we getting the most out of changing games by doing it this way?' amongst the players that hopefully works out why it's happening, or at least gives some hints. <br/><br/>It could be the GM's all just presume they know best and so don't bother reading. It could be they are making an executive decision to run all the games the same way because they don't see a benefit to learning new systems. It could be that they just can't be bothered to read rulebooks and have skimmed through them. Or a number of other reasons. If you're lucky the reasons that are flagged will be ones that can be worked with rather than just obstinant refusal (if it's that, and you are having fun playing, then it might be time to surrender, although for your own sanity it might also be time to admit that there's little point pretending to play different systems and then not doing it.)<br/><br/>Hopefully with the ground sounded out the group can then try and play the game as it was written.

I haven't read any *World games but Barf forth apocalyptica is a brilliant convention but it's just a convention and those has a tendency to be ignored. My first game consisted mostly by conventions and my experienced was that people ignored them because I put them in a GM chapter and then complained to me when my game (the game mechanics) didn't work with their gaming style. When I talk about structures I mean things like (I'm just throwing together an example now):<br/><br/>CREATE A SCENE<br/>1. Establish the environment by barfing forth apocalyptica.<br/>2. Create a situation by using a [premade list of catastrophes] and also establish who's there.<br/>3.

I feel the same way too, for years I've been asking on a lot of places why the heck the GM chapter doesn't have RULES? Why there aren't RULES the GM must follow? Only to be shooed away every single time because rule Zero or other crappy excuse. The fact that every GM is able to infere how a game is played by reading examples/try and error/making up their own procedure/looking for advice STILL DOESNT MAKE A SEPECK OF A DIFFERENCE. To the date, only GMless games and other nanogames have ACTUAL rules about how the GM should proceed. Not that you've got to make a rule for every situation, but you can make general rules that apply to a lot of stuff if you can single out the different roots of the usual problems that arise at the table.<br/><br/>*W games are now the closest approach at having GM-oriented rules. Look how well these are doing. So well that AMByard KNOWS something is missing even while having a good time with it.

In a video game, if you're used to pressing "A" to jump and jumping is what you want to do, when you press "A" and you don't jump, you'll quickly learn to divest yourself of that notion and find the button. Board games (usually) offer similar automatic, system-provided feedback. If the arrows on the board all go in one direction, it's really obvious that you're going against the rules if you move your piece in the other direction. That said, there's actually nothing stopping you unless you get feedback from the players... and therein lies the rub for roleplaying games. The only mechanism for feedback is the players, which is difficult to do with the murky and unspecified social contracts that happen at a gaming table. By not speaking up, you're not providing the feedback needed to change behavior. But - and this is an important point - using feedback to change <b>task-based</b> behavior (e.g. which button you push to jump) is way, way easier than using feedback to change <b>goal-based</b> behavior.<br/><br/>So, to sum up other advice in this thread with a little cog sci: if they're goal is to run the game like it's supposed to be run and they're just goofing up, providing feedback should be a breeze and it'll be welcomed.

When it's pointed out that "this game right here has new rules in a strange place", many people aren't interested. They don't see the rationale for changing those kind of rules, especially if it's going to be effortful and strange.<br/><br/>And... BW's GM rules aren't as in-your-face-these-are-rules-for-the-GM as DW's, and we've already established that you can skim-read DW and miss that the GM has rules too.

I think <a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a> and <a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a> are saying that the presentation of GM "advice" is often ineffective because it is not explicitly a <b>rule</b> in most texts with the same force as, say, "roll 2d6" or other more "mechanical" instructions. Others are saying that both DW and BW <b>do</b> actually have GM rules, but I think everyone (maybe) concedes that even when there are GM rules, they are are somewhat more nebulous than the rules for character creation or conflict resolution. If you forget a principle or something, people will say, "it just takes practice -- keep working at it -- it's okay if you don't get it quite right." If you are rolling 1d6 instead of 2d6 though, people would say, "how did you manage to mess that up dummy? It says 2d6 right there in the rules!" GM stuff is clearly treated as a different kind of thing. Should it be different? <br/><br/>So, the question is: how do we make these nebulous GM conventions/rules feel more mandatory and less discretionary? The Rickard/WarriorMonk approach includes a more procedural explanation of the GM job in the text.

(Read "The Design of Everyday Things" for more.) In a video game, if you're used to pressing "A" to jump and jumping is what you want to do, when you press "A" and you don't jump, you'll quickly learn to divest yourself of that notion and find the button. Board games (usually) offer similar automatic, system-provided feedback. If the arrows on the board all go in one direction, it's really obvious that you're going against the rules if you move your piece in the other direction. That said, there's actually nothing stopping you unless you get feedback from the players... and therein lies the rub for roleplaying games. The only mechanism for feedback is the players, which is difficult to do with the murky and unspecified social contracts that happen at a gaming table. By not speaking up, you're not providing the feedback needed to change behavior. But - and this is an important point - using feedback to change <b>task-based</b> behavior (e.g. which button you push to jump) is way, way easier than using feedback to change <b>goal-based</b> behavior.<br/><br/>So, to sum up other advice in this thread with a little cog sci: if they're goal is to run the game like it's supposed to be run and they're just goofing up, providing feedback should be a breeze and it'll be welcomed. If their goal is to use this new system to run the game they want to run... that's harder. You have to use much more nuanced and well-crafted social feedback to get them to change goals.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nThis is fascinating.

We've been playing Monsterhearts. So I kind of wanted to shift the playculture at my table by playing more to the rules of the game, cause my group does tend to drift rules a lot. Monsterhearts though, I wanted to play it 100%.<br/><br/>So as a player, I was really active on being on top of how to play the game. I became the rules lawyer! I never do that, actually. BUUUUUUUUT after awhile play did turn more toward the rules, especially when people saw how advancement bonuses works, and how you could tailor your roleplay toward those and the mechanics are fun. <br/><br/>There were negatives to doing this. Because I was pushing kind of hard as a player, I kind of took over a little bit, and it was definitely percieved by other players that I got more time in the spotlight (even though I'd always bring two other players into a scene with me). Kind of like, I abused the "player agency" storygame mantra. I think there were truths in this, sometimes when I'm in the spotlight I don't realize how long I'm there. But also, I think I was maybe pushing my play style on them a little too hard. The difficult thing here for me is that, my playstyle is <i>how you play the game by the rules.</i><br/><br/>I think maybe it's persistence. It's playing by the rules. It's getting an ally at the table to help you out. It's getting your GM on board. It's pointing out the cool stuff about the game and sharing why you're excited about it. Like, keeping it positive and stuff. It's kind of a lot of work. I dunno though, I've had some luck with it. I never, ever thought my group would play a game as sexy monsterhearts, and it really just took 1) inviting the right people to the game out of the 8 or so regulars we have and 2) being really positive and excited about playing it, and bringing it as a player, and helping other players shine and 3) lead by example. Now that part of the group is totally cool playing romantic indie games.

I don't think that suggestion is a bad one or incompatible with the other approaches people have posted. <br/><br/></blockquote>\nMay I speak some heresy?<br/><br/>Look, I know that part of what interests me about the design culture in these parts is that making mechanics out of best practices people have discovered over the years is a well regarded ideal.<br/><br/>I kinda love it myself.<br/><br/>There is, however, the Mirror Universe approach, where all GMs have goatees.<br/><br/>In that Mirror Universe version of the local design culture, rather than mechanizing all of this stuff, people took a different approach ( because people in the Mirror Universe are Evul!): There are no mechanics and everything is in the hands of the GM.<br/><br/>There aren't any rules to speak of, the closest to them are just tools to achieve different effects, and use of any of them is discretionary. Books for those goateed Viking hat wearing GMs are recipe books at best, and the uses of the tools are explained based on what their probable affect on play will be.<br/><br/>Settings/situations are separate books. or even style of session/adventure books alone exist. They might have some suggested recipes(tools) in them for use in those circumstances. Heck, some Viking GMs might even allow players to read those settings or GM books. Some GMs who know what recipes they intend to use may even tell players in advance that they have some favorites so expect them to be used in play.<br/><br/>And that's the sum total of it. Players come and play their characters and run with it. If they hate the GM and his poor understanding of the recipes, they stage a bloody coup d'\xe9tat and promote one of the survivors as the new Head of the Regime. Because it's a Mirror Universe.<br/><br/>I like to think of classic RPG design existing in some weird halfway nexus point between the local design Universe and that Mirror Universe. Naturally then, it tends to half the best/worst of both.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415165/#Comment_415165" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-31T13:03:01+00:00" title="May 31, 2013  1:03PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It's getting an ally at the table to help you out.</blockquote>\nThis.

Like, you are afraid to call out the fact that some shared endeavor just isn't fun for you. Telling someone that you're not having fun can be hard, but if done right, it doesn't have to be an accusation of incompetence. <br/><br/>When people sit around a table and play, say, chess or RISK!, there's an expectation that you're all going to play by the rules. Somehow, the RPG culture lost this assumption. The basic assumption from D&amp;D roots is that the GM is gonna make up some rules and you all have to play by them or GTFO. I think that's pretty broken. It's especially broken for storygames that explicitly tell you how to play a different way than all those D&amp;D games you've played. I mean, *World games pretty much spell out how to GM the game, leaving little ambiguity. If a GM is gonna intentionally ignore that stuff, he should be up-front with the players about it. You didn't want to play Dungeon World for the setting; you wanted to play it for the unique experience that the rules and principles offer.<br/><br/>Problem is, people don't read closely. Your GM probably isn't intentionally ignoring stuff. He's probably falling back on old habits and feels overwhelmed by the changes demanded by the rules. <br/><br/>I'd pull the GM aside, express your desire to play the game as written to see how it goes (and leave all issues of fun unspoken, at least at first) and see if he's amenable to that. He'll probably say, "Wasn't I?" and you can talk about where he is missing some things. Offer to help, if he's lost or overwhelmed. Offer to run a sample session. Fun is a collaborative endeavor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415171/#Comment_415171" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-31T13:43:18+00:00" title="May 31, 2013  1:43PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was all set to answer the question but the OP was about some Dungeon World thing. Nobody plays Dungeon World anymore people, we're into the Mortal Coil Renaissance these days.  Well, anyway, the answer to the question is:<br/><br/>* tell them what to do, textually, verbally and/or with illustrations<br/>* model it for them in writing, through verbally performed examples (roleplay?!?) and in person actually doing it<br/>* get them to agree to try it in a "safe practice" zone (this may be a one-shot, with a different or smaller group, at a convention, etc.)<br/>* give concrete feedback in a "welcome feedback" zone (this may be in the moment, after the game, or after several sessions depending on your relationship and the group)<br/><br/>If that doesn't work, they probably don't want to do the thing you're teaching. Don't worry though, you can still get them to do whatever it is you want them to do:<br/><br/>* pay them money to do it the way you want it.                        </div>\n<div

first) and see if he's amenable to that.

I think <a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a> and <a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a> are saying that the presentation of GM "advice" is often ineffective because it is not explicitly a <b>rule</b> in most texts with the same force as, say, "roll 2d6" or other more "mechanical" instructions. Others are saying that both DW and BW <b>do</b> actually have GM rules, but I think everyone (maybe) concedes that even when there are GM rules, they are are somewhat more nebulous than the rules for character creation or conflict resolution. If you forget a principle or something, people will say, "it just takes practice -- keep working at it -- it's okay if you don't get it quite right." If you are rolling 1d6 instead of 2d6 though, people would say, "how did you manage to mess that up dummy? It says 2d6 right there in the rules!" GM stuff is clearly treated as a different kind of thing. Should it be different? <br/><br/>So, the question is: how do we make these nebulous GM conventions/rules feel more mandatory and less discretionary? The Rickard/WarriorMonk approach includes a more procedural explanation of the GM job in the text. I don't think that suggestion is a bad one or incompatible with the other approaches people have posted. <br/><br/></blockquote>\nAMByard nailed it here better than I did. The word I needed was "procedural". GM chapters always revolve around concepts, but you have to read all the actual examples to see them in action and learn how to apply them. Why? Because examples <i>illustrate the actual procedure</i>, while conventions and definitions of concepts <i>explain</i> the procedure. And that's nice, but come on, I need to learn how to play the GM part and telling me how I should treat players nicely and giving me permission to create new races under certain standards isn't a procedure!<br/><br/>So yes, I'm so excited by the game concept that I'll learn the mechanics, look for whatever the examples say and create my own damn procedure, or steal what I liked from that guy I saw GMing or go to a convention and play to have the procedure clear in my head, and we have all done this process to a certain degree of success so we all think is all right to learn to GM like this... until threads like this appear and we realize that we might be playing games wrong and missing the different experiences that took their designers to create them.<br/><br/>See, this was my case: I started in the hobbie playing VtM with a cool GM who was an actor. Learned a lot from him and started to GM using his tricks and approach. Then I played 3.5 with the same group but with a different GM and our player's approach worked at first, we advanced fast without doing too much dungeon crawling. But then the DM changed the focus of the game to tactical battles with his own rules interpretation and ruined the story. The game became an endless discussion about rules so I switched to other games and got the usual hatred for some aspects of D&amp;D you see in heartbreaker designers, which of course, made me design a few. It wasn't until a few years ago that I learned how old school was played and realize the innumerable ways of playing a single game that are out there. And I wondered if there was a way for designers to share better their view about their games.<br/><br/>Procedures do this at their finest. Flowcharts as mentioned above, examples. And of course, rules. I think I saw this magic happen first in Dogs in the Vineyard. It features an excellent procedure to design adventure starting points (towns) giving you an actual clue on how to start your prep. That was something I really missed in DRyH and the only reason I'm not playing that game. *W guidelines are also really nice but to the day I'm still wondering why nobody has the nerves to call them rules and ask the GM to follow them. Not because whatever else they are doing is wrong or because somebody isn't having fun, but at least for respect to the designer's effort to bring you a different game experience. Otherwise, why do you buy new games, when you can always find or make a mod for playing sci-fi, vampires or medieval fantasy with the same ruleset and procedures and conventions you're so comfortable with?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moleculo" title="moleculo"><img alt="moleculo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/874/n4G37MA34HKP8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moleculo">moleculo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415188/#Comment_415188" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-31T15:21:05+00:00" title="May 31, 2013  3:21PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Otherwise, why do you buy new games, when you can always find or make a mod for playing sci-fi, vampires or medieval fantasy with the same ruleset and procedures and conventions you're so comfortable with?</blockquote>We have just the thing for that: it's called GURPS. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>(save your hate mail...

I think Vincent Baker had a post on his blog with animated gifs illustrating this principle.  <br/><br/>This might seem self-evident, but I assure you it's not.  If you're coming from other gaming traditions (cough White Wolf cough), it may seem very natural to play the game with a lot of houserules and table-specific assumptions that seem to make the game run better.  After all, the mechanics may have been written all in one caffeine-fueled night by a pissed-off editor to make deadline... why let the actual text get in the way of playing the Game whose PlatoniciIdeal can be seen, glowing softly, behind the haze of rules? I believe that this is the ground state of roleplaying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415233/#Comment_415233" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-01T08:38:52+00:00" title="June  1, 2013  8:38AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is some great advice!
