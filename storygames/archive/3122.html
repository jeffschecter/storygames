Of all the many many games out there that have written out play reports, maybe 90 percent are one-shots where people sit down, come up with the whole show, pick one episode out of the season to do (NEVER the pilot), then do it that one episode, all in one session, usually four hours, and never touch it again.<br/><br/>Seems sort of like taking your winnebago down the street to pick up your mail.<br/><br/>Can anyone hypothesize as to why that is?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71169/#Comment_71169" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-22T15:29:23+00:00" title="May 22, 2007  3:29PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 22, 2007 3:30PM by Remi.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd just like to say that I don't do single episodes for convention games. I've specifically tried to come up with a way to quickly create and then play a 'miniseries' in PTA, shifting screen presence three times throughout the game. It works pretty well. Not 'full season of PTA' well, but well enough that it creates good to great play, and gives a solid impression of the fanmail economy and the effect of shifting screen presence.<br/><br/>I don't really 'get' the idea of doing a pilot, though. It's the one part of PTA that I've never used. Playing a game in the style of an actual pilot seems self-defeating. Why play a game that doesn't matter? Better to make a mistake while going all out than have an episode that you can do over.<br/><br/>As for answering your question . . . well, I have no idea. I tend to ride the wave of excitement out of a good con, and thus write up those games, so that's why I've written up two of my PTA games from Cons (although I did participate in the discussion of our Deep in the Blue game).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D" title="Thomas D"><img alt="Thomas D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://landfill.thesnakefarm.com/images/misc/idescols.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D">Thomas D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71176/#Comment_71176" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-22T15:53:02+00:00" title="May 22, 2007  3:53PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I get to play it, it's at game days where I'm not guaranteed that we'll have the same players for a continuing series over the next few months.  PTA is simple to explain and get playing with a group of strangers.   I've always run the one-shots as pilots so nobody feels like they're being stuck with a suck-ass character ("Hey, want to play Xander?  We've got people lined up to play Buffy, Angel, and Faith.")<br/><br/>What I've wanted to do lately though is play a one-shot of PTA but not a pilot episode.  I'd really like to run the episode before the season closer for a show based on D&amp;D, where we'd have a spotlight character and some background characters.  To entice players to play the 1 screen presence protags, I'm thinking of giving out fan mail held over from a previous game session.  Screen presence 1 would get you 5 fan mail, Presence 2 gets you 3 fan mail, and spotlight characters start with one fan mail.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71177/#Comment_71177" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-22T15:55:28+00:00" title="May 22, 2007  3:55PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm...

I have yet to experience a bad session of PTA, but I think that's simply luck on my part with finding groups that work really well together and are able to toss ideas back and forth and weave a story successfully together. But honestly, I don't think I'd want to extend a PTA game through several sessions. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny time I've played PTA, the game would start off lightly and then snowball into a very intense game, with a strong connection between all characters as well as the players, and I don't think that the same feelings would be there if the game were put down and come back to a few weeks or even just a day or two later. If I had an entire day set aside just to play a full game of PTA, I would do it, but I would be very hesitant to try running the same game over several days. It's not that I think the game would be bad that way, I just don't think it'd have the same intensity that way. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs to why most people don't play the pilot in a one-shot, I think it's because they effectively do that when coming up with the idea and characters for the game. Perhaps it's just been my experience, but whenever I've played PTA, we would sit around trying to come up with an idea for the show we would like to play, and as we perfected that idea, character ideas would come out and we'd end up creating a whole background and introduction to the show just by talking about what we would like to play. At that point, playing a Pilot episode would just seem redundant because we'd already discussed the backgrounds of the characters and the story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71241/#Comment_71241" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-22T21:51:25+00:00" title="May 22, 2007  9:51PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally, I'm just amazed that so many people manage to get a PTA game <i>started</i> in less than three hours, let alone go on to have time to play through that episode.

When I've played as one-shots at game days, we managed to get through the series and character creation in about 45 minutes, maybe fifty.  I think what really helped out was listening to Judd's recording of his PTA Life on Mars game and reading a bit of discussion on that game.  In short, have the Producer keep things moving and focused on the development of the game while listening for what's interesting to the players.  <br/><br/>The first question I ask as Producer is "What types of shows do you not want?"  That limits the field of possible shows and focuses the players attention on what's left.  I figure ten minutes to get a show genre and fifteen to get the broad strokes of what we've got in the show, then get to about fifteen, twenty minutes to go over character generation.  By that time, five minutes should be enough to come up with a series title, theme song, and look and feel of our opening credits.<br/><br/>I've heard of people taking a whole multi-hour game session to come up with the series concept and protagonists then not getting able to play until the following session.  I suppose this is because with a one-shot, you're more open to other player's suggestions.  After all, you're only going to have a three or four hour investment in the show instead of six game sessions spread out over the next two months.  (In the Philly cops in the Vietnam era show, <i>City of Brotherly Love</i>, I wasn't all that gung-ho about the genre when another player suggested "cop show". In fact, if we were going to play a five episode season every Saturday, I'd have vetoed the genre.  But because we were only going to play over the next few hours, I went along with it and had a great time.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

The game's just a poor fit to our group's preferred style: it's not meant to deliver the type of game that we find to be most fun, and there's nothing at all wrong with that.  It's not a bad game, it's just not right for us.  But you asked, so I'll tell.<br/><br/>I can give you an executive summary in case you'd rather skip the gory details:  Put simply, we are a group which does not commit enthusiastically to anything quickly and/or is paralyzed by having too many options, which leads to awkward silences and a lot of dead-ends during brainstorming.  Also, our most creative members tend to not enjoy the results of collaborative work as much as they enjoy doing their own thing, which makes brainstorming a perfect way to create settings they <i>like</i> but cannot <i>love</i>.<br/><br/><br/>Anyway, here's how our typical PTA pitch sessions would go.<br/><br/>The first problem sign is that, unlike Thomas D's experience, our Producer's attempts at keeping things moving are immediately thwarted by the blank stares of the players.  There are no initial ideas.  Minutes pass, and a few things are ruled out.  Then a few more.  Some suggestions for a genre and a type of show begin to show up somewhere about ten or fifteen minutes in, although there's no clear consensus on what, if anything, is going to appeal to everyone...perhaps because there's one player who actively dislikes being put on the spot for ideas, another player who doesn't much care what gets played either way, and the remainder are more the "slow burn" than "sudden inspiration" type.  (I'm including myself in that latter bunch: my enthusiasm for a setting or idea increases significantly if I have a lot of time to kick it around in my head and get myself charged up about it.  Ask me three days later what I think of something and you'll always get a better, more enthusiastic answer than you will if you ask me immediately.)  The Producer is reluctant to just jump in and say "Let's do THIS," perhaps because he is under the mistaken impression that the group will like the game more if they come up with the premise for it themselves.  (He has since admitted that this is obviously not true for us, and that in any case it's really more important that <i>he</i> be thrilled by the game's premise, since he cannot and does not put his best effort into running/moderating a game that he isn't thrilled by).<br/><br/>Probably by about 40 minutes in, we've managed to settle on a genre and maybe a handful of ideas.  Character concepts can take about another hour, this time with even less that the Producer can do to grease the wheels beyond throwing in an odd idea here or there, some of which fly like lead balloons.  There's some cross-chatter that attempts to tie characters together, but the clock is definitely ticking at this point, because we usually only get together for four or five hours and we've already blown nearly 2 hours of that, mostly on this brainstorming thing.  Eventually characters are settled on, although the premise of the game is still fuzzy.  It'll take fifteen to thirty more pause-filled minutes of hemming and hawing to get the setting, premise, and characters all on the same page, or at least to a near enough approximation of it to "just play already, jeez."<br/><br/>Our group can then stall out for five minutes or longer on something as trivial as coming up with the show's title.  (Personally, I think the Producer should've bagged this step if no one had any immediate suggestions, but...)<br/><br/>And then, at long last, we finally get to play.<br/><br/>Whereupon we discover that the Producer's enthusiasm for the setting we came up with isn't at all like the kind of fire he brings to a setting he created himself, that only one player is reasonably consistent about giving fan mail, that the player who makes the best jokes tends to get the lion's share of fan mail anyway (even--and perhaps especially--if it doesn't have much to do with the scene), that two of the players actively despise narrating anything and will intentially avoid or lose conflicts in order to dodge that bullet, that the plot of our show doesn't really satisfy anyone (least of all the people who are most directly involved in creating it), that the conflicts we get don't seem as cool as the ones we get in other games, that over half of the players feel like they're not able to really enjoy playing their characters, and eventually despite our best efforts to address these problems and the other ones that crop up, we determine that we just aren't the group that PTA was written for.<br/><br/>And that's fine, really it is.  We have GMs who love the games they run and we have players who love those games, and we get far more than our fair share of great gaming moments out of it.  PTA just doesn't fit in our bag of tricks, is all, and there's no shame in that.  Like I said, I'm amazed by the people who seem to think making it work as a one-shot is effortless to the point of being trivial: I assure you, it is not.  If you think it is, you are ignoring just how remarkable (or lucky, or weird, or whatever) you are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71493/#Comment_71493" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-23T13:52:34+00:00" title="May 23, 2007  1:52PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Honestly, the way to conquer pitch session paralysis is to skip out on the "it's anyone's game for doing anything!" kum-ba-ya vibe and take a page instead from creative writing classes.<br/><br/>There, a similar phenomenon happens: blank page paralysis.  But the moment the students get something that restricts them -- an assignment -- they can be suddenly extremely creative.<br/><br/>What PTA needs is a list of premise restrictions.  "It's a..." (draws a card from a deck) "Supernatural..." (draws another card) "Political Thriller.  Okay, go!"<br/><br/>Same thing with a list of character roles.<br/><br/>Give folks a leg up, dig?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71497/#Comment_71497" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-23T14:04:37+00:00" title="May 23, 2007  2:04PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With strong Producer pushing you can avoid the blank page problem, unless the players just aren't the "I've got an awesome idea I need to share now" type. I run PTA at cons a <i>lot</i> and here's what I do:<br/><br/>Everyone give me at least one idea for a show. If need be I will prime the pump by suggesting one. Usually 4/5ths of the people can do that and 1/5th is stuck. I then get everyone to help that person. It's very very very very very very very soft and polite pressure<br/><br/>Then we compare the shows and I ask if there's any concept anyone is particularly turned off by or feels like there's no way they can enjoy. I ask why, then if possible I then ask the person who came up with that idea or someone who likes it too to address the concerns of the naysayer. If that doesn't turn the naysayer around 100% and get that person as enthusiastic about the show idea as the person who came up with it, I make it very clear we should ditch it. I tell people we should ditch <i>any</i> premise that we're not all really excited by. Not just can live with, really excited by.<br/><br/>Once we strike bad things from the list, I ask if anyone has a premise they're really excited by. We often see about combining premises that are getting a lot of love.<br/><br/>After going through some setting conventions, tone, etc., I then ask people to come up with a list of likely characters on the show. Not, "what do you want to play?" but rather, "what roles would we write into the show." Earlier on I give a speech about this being both the set and the writers' room, and the players being both actors and the writing team, so this bit reinforces that. Once we have a list of characters I'll read it off a couple of times and ask if anyone is really excited about one of them.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>And so on. Something to note is that throughout the process I am never hesitant to put my foot in and make suggestions. I make it very clear in my schpiel that the Producer is a very not-controlly GM role, and then I treat myself like another player at the table, except I try to be the guy who suggests something last if I can be.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>I've been meaning to do a "How I run PTA" thing because I've never had a wholly-bad session and I have recently learned that there are some things I do that are very different from other people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71500/#Comment_71500" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-23T14:18:00+00:00" title="May 23, 2007  2:18PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Remi!

There's one '3' SP out there for each segment, and everyone else is divided, as evenly as possible, into 1's and 2's.
