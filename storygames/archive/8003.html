Sorcerer has a free-and-clear phase where everyone announces actions. In IaWA you roll first, then announce your actions.<br/><br/>What's the impact on play? How does it feel different at the table? Does it produce different fiction? <br/><br/>Or is the IaWA method just "more advanced", in the sense that it's the smarter and simpler way to go? (This last one might be more of a question of opinion, of course, but please offer yours if you feel comfortable.)<br/><br/>2. In Sorcerer, you do not reroll to take your action--you use the dice as they were initially rolled. In IaWA, everyone except the first person in a round <i>does</i> reroll the dice.<br/><br/>How does this affect the fiction, the game, the players? What's the impact?<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176871/#Comment_176871" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-31T09:43:23+00:00" title="October 31, 2008  9:43AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have the IaWa book in front of me, but even though it doesn't have stakes, I believe you still need to describe what you are doing before you roll dice so the players can determine if they are actually in conflict. The how is everything. For example:<br/><br/>Situation 1:<br/>Vincent: ::eating a sandwich::  <br/>Joshua: I want that sandwich!<br/>GM: Joshua, what are you doing?<br/>Joshua: I'm going to take that sandwich!<br/>Vincent: I won't let him!!!<br/>GM: roll!<br/><br/>Situation 2:<br/>Vincent: ::eating a sandwich::  <br/>Joshua: I want that sandwich!<br/>GM: Joshua, what are you doing?<br/>Joshua: I'm going to give Vincent $50 for his sandwich.<br/>Vincent: Sure thing! <br/>GM: No conflict!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176882/#Comment_176882" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-31T11:00:54+00:00" title="October 31, 2008 11:00AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul,<br/><br/>I have a large amount of experience in both games.  This to me is the core distinction.<br/><br/>In Sorcerer you have to commit to an action up front and you can't willingly change or stop it mid-round.  You don't even know the order.  This can lead to some pretty brutal situations where (a) you simply don't get your action because the context has changed and your action no longer makes sense or (b) given the change in the situation you might "regret" your action.  That "regret" is in quotes because you know full well going into the round what might happen before you take your action.  It's a calculated risk.  These are not flaws.  They are by design.<br/><br/>In A Wicked Age... on the other hand let's you respond to the fictional context mid-round.  If the situation changes by the time your "go" comes up you can change whatever you may have had in mind at the beginning (i.e. the thing you chose your forms based on).  However, In A Wicked Age has a trade off with that.  In Sorcerer when you are the target of action before your own happens you have a choice, defend minimally and keep your action or give up your action and defend maximally.  In A Wicked Age, however, forces you to "abort" and defend maximally since you can't be a Challenger this round if you've had to answer.<br/><br/>So that's the trade off, flexibility of announcement in exchange for opportunities for action.<br/><br/>I actually slightly prefer Sorcerer's method because I think it provides for slightly more moments of hard decisions and produces more "sudden reversal" moments.  But I'm not a friendly player.  I like Sorcerer's commit and forever hold your peace methodology.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176889/#Comment_176889" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-31T11:28:35+00:00" title="October 31, 2008 11:28AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br/><br/>Note, however, that in both IaWA and the sandwich example (and what a delicious example it is) the person who is saying, "Oh, no, you don't!" actually does NOT state their action.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176890/#Comment_176890" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-31T11:30:08+00:00" title="October 31, 2008 11:30AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse,<br/><br/>Cool.

Socially I think it leads to people not acting at all because "it won't matter anyway" and loosens up the consequences for having acted.  People won't throw their weight behind and action and thus that weight has no opportunity to "back fire."<br/><br/>Dogs in the Vineyard has some subtleties around this.  Your dice are sitting in front of you and so you have a choice.  You're not looking a static roll.  So a "Raise" is really much more of a gamble.  You *pick* two dice to put your money where your mouth is.  And although the other player's *initial* ability to respond is calculable what Traits or chances to Escalate are not.  So while you may throw high or low dice behind an action you don't know whether he'll suddenly pull out a Reverse The Blow from an awesome roll on an unexpected Trait or choose to Take the Blow with all his smallest dice on a gunshot you backed with relatively low numbers.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176895/#Comment_176895" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-31T11:43:15+00:00" title="October 31, 2008 11:43AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>In IaWA, you reroll the dice, because narrating an action based on a crappy roll wouldn't feel terribly good.</blockquote>\nAlso, to be fair.<br/><br/>Rather than asking why you reroll, I tend to think that IAWA has an initiative roll <b><i>and </i></b>an "action" roll, but the highest initiative rolling one gets the <b>extra bonus </b>of "keeping" her nice initiative roll to stand as her action roll as well.
