I was the only one who had read the game, though I had talked about it a bit to some of the others.<br/><br/>Setting and character creation started well. The oracles went down brilliantly and people latched onto characters they wanted to play very quickly, though few were left for the GM (more appeared later on though that had not occurred to us at the start). The players found designing the characters easy, and the particular strengths really hard. Indeed it took us as long to design the strengths as to do the rest of the character gen, as people worried about what did, or did not, sound like a good power. In the end half the players didn't take one, which I think was a problem for them later.<br/><br/>We ended up with a girl with the soul  of a jaguar, her disembodied real soul, the ghost of a murdered merchant, a treasure seeker, and the merchant's son, who was also the treasure seeker's partner. Finally was map, a supernatural spirit with the power to give directions to any place in the body of a clay golem in the shape of a boy, and Amok, the jaguar without a soul who stalked most of the other characters at various points.<br/><br/>Best interests were also hard for some people, who struggled to find two. I tried the technique of doing one or two NPC ones, and then going round the table getting one from each player, then adding some more NPC ones and then going back for the rest, which seemed to work okay, but people had trouble coming up with their relationships to the other characters right at the front of the game, before they knew any of them.<br/><br/>Things went well in play. Ghosts haunted people and gave them nightmares. Asha, Map and the little brother of the merchant's son ran away with each other, got chased by various parties, dug up the merchant's body and ended up in the tomb of an ancient Queen, turned map into a real boy, captured the jaguar and put the girl's soul in it's body and won justice for the murdered man. The conflicts went smoothly for the most part, with some issues about helping others and intervening half way through a conflict that I have discussed elsewhere. Various names went on the owe list, though fewer than we had expected, and much interest was expressed in continuing, so I hope we do so.<br/><br/>None of the players are on this forum, sadly, so I don't expect much followup.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
