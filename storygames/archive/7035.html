The ENnies booth is <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231504&amp;Mode=like">#1504</a>.  Just be sure to bring the requisite six copies (one for each judge, one for admin) and a submission form (new forms will be going up on the site shortly) by the end of the day Saturday so we can get it ready for the judges to pick up Sunday morning before heading home.  Submitting early also offers the advantage of giving the judges plenty of time to really dig into your product.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I was thinking it would be cool to set up a "Lot of Indie Games" as one of the lots for the Silent Auction at the ENnies ceremony.  If anybody would like to donate product (books, accessories, CDs), merch (T-shirt, buttons), a gift certificate for the Forge's, IPR, or Ashcan Front's or anybody else's booth, or some other product or service (dinner with Ron Edwards, or whack Darcy Burgess with a whifflebat, for example) to put together a big package, that'd be awesome.  It helps raise visibility of the products, and is a small buy-in to show support for the ENnies for those publishers who may not have submitted their product for this year's awards (I'm looking at you, Luke Crane), but still want to show support of the ENnies.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith regards to judge candidate eligibility, I think we're reaching the point now where we will let the fandom voters decide whether they think someone's involvement with a publisher constitutes a conflict of interest.  Obviously, the owner of a publishing company, big or small, or active freelancers can't participate, especially if their product is submitted.  But a peripheral freelancer or a playtester wants to throw in their hat, I'll decide if their involvement warrants outright elimination, or if we simply have them declare their involvement on their nomination form (question 2) and let the voters choose.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156518/#Comment_156518" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-14T15:32:02+00:00" title="July 14, 2008  3:32PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2008 3:34PM by Thunder_God.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just a note, I just ran a search to verify my memory, and there was no note on SG, asking for publishers' submissions for the 2008 awards.<br><br>Are the post May 2008 games you're asking for to be for next year's judging?

Plenty of judges, past and current, enjoy indie games and Fred has shown that getting out the vote is often the most important part.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156603/#Comment_156603" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-15T05:16:25+00:00" title="July 15, 2008  5:16AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>I checked the ENnies web page, ENworld, and RPGnet and don't see any information about judge nominations... so I guess it's not gonna happen this year.

Originally I wanted to have the judges elections happening at the same time as the product voting, but a lot of factors conspired against it.  So instead the judge elections for the 2009 Awards will be held August 4-10th, 2008.  That way we can announce the winners at the Gen Con ceremony in Indianapolis, and send the <strike>poor suckers</strike> brave volunteers home with a box or two of product.  Sure do hope none of those elected fly in- last year each judge brought home a huge box of product- well enough stuff to keep them and their gaming group occupied until Christmas!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy apologies for not coming begging for product on SG.  I'm so used to The Forge being The Place To Be in terms of indie publishers that SG wasn't quite on my radar.  I'll try and make more of an effort, but just a reminder, I may not have time to go by every single third-party message board out there to troll for submissions.  Your best bet is to drop off stuff at the ENnies booth (#1504) at Gen Con Indy if it was released after May 1, 2008.  For stuff released later on, I suggest getting together with other small-press guys and combining your shipping efforts- perhaps once around the beginning of December so the judges have some stuff to read over winter holidays, and then once more just after GAMA, and once in May.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm about finalized the judge candidacy self-nomination forms.  I'm going to put them up on the web site by the end of the week, and will be posting the information for the judges as it comes in.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with CW about the personal statement.  Those first 250 characters that will be going up on the web site beside your mug (and your top 3 board aliases) are what convince the voter to click on your name and get to learn more about your platform.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd since these are fan awards, we can't have publishers as judges.  And if an indie publisher wants to be taken seriously as a professional (as they should), they can't be a judge.  At the ENnies we treat all publishers and submitted entries with the same amount of respect, so if I'm not going to allow Wizards of the Coast staff to submit themselves for candidacy, we certainly can't consider indie publishers.  It'll have to be enough of an olive branch that I opened it up to playtesters and peripheral freelancers. Now, if you've got a game you've been working on for years that hasn't been published yet, you might still be eligible.  And if you haven't published anything in 2 years, you might be eligible. But let's face it- having a publisher as a judge takes away the whole impact of these not being "industry" awards.  And it creates a sense of impropriety, unfairness and blatant conflict of interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, there are plenty of indie fans out there who haven't published anything themselves whom I am certain could do an excellent job of being a judge.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo to answer someone else's question about how to nominate someone for judge, they do it themselves.<br/>\nOnce we get the questions out, interested individuals email a 250 character statement, a photo (no more than 150 pixels tall or wide), a larger statement, fill out a form and answer the questions.  When the information is complete, their info goes up on the web site.  After that, they can campaign all they like on the boards and IRL.  Voting goes live the day after the product voting closes.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this covers it all.

Just ask The Pundit. It's been too long, too long.<br><br>Denise,<br>The ENnies, as best I could tell in the years I participated, are primarily a popularity contest, and secondarily a potluck recognition of quality. <br><br>My products are controversial niches of niches. Critics love 'em, fans hate 'em. So the popularity contest part gets me every time.<br><br>I produced one book in the alloted period, a piece of historical/mythological game set in an obscure period of Japanese history. I sold at most 500 copies of said book (all direct, too). To say it's an obscure title is being generous. Submitting it to the ENnies for the sake of form seems counterproductive. It's a waste of good books and just clutters up the judge's schedule.<br><br>The potluck isn't to my taste either: The ENnies are driven by publisher submission; it's a self-selected mass of games. Each publisher brings a dish, but if everyone brings potato salad, all we're going to eat is potato salad. Submission isn't based on quality game design. It's based on who pays attention to awards shows. Our esteemed and overworked judges make selections from that game mass. They're the true heroes. Even so, they could be selecting from the best Green Ronin, Goodman Games and Mongoose have to offer, but they'll still be missing out on lots of good games that have gone unsubmitted.<br><br>I love awards. I think they're great. Critical acclaim is sweet. If you want to give my games awards, I will gladly accept them. <br>However, I have no plans to submit any further BWHQ titles to the ENnies as I don't think this awards program fits with how I view my games. <br><br>Thanks,<br>-Luke                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denise" title="Denise"><img alt="Denise" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denise">Denise</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156825/#Comment_156825" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-16T04:35:28+00:00" title="July 16, 2008  4:35AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Luke,<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the feedback, and I have to say, I tend to agree with you to a point.  Once they get past the judges' vetting period and it comes down to the popular vote, let's face it- the winner is most likely determined by their market penetration.  Not to say that all the nominees aren't worthy.  And that's where the real value lies for many- in the nomination.<br/>\n<br/>\nGetting that extra visibility for a smaller product can be helpful in raising its profile, and many smaller publishers have said that their ENnie nomination made a noticeable difference in sales.  But I don't want to be talking about The ENnies as a marketing tool, because that's not what they're about.  It's about showing off some truly awesome game material and saying "thanks, good job" to those who put it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI totally respect your decision- but hope that not too many people will follow your suit!

(This will sound like criticism for criticism's sake, but it's not, and I hope it's helpful).<br><br>There's an atmosphere of objectivity: you're looking for <i>excellence</i>, it doesn't matter who published it, you'll consider anything, and so on.<br/><br/>But, in reality, the awards are subjective, like all awards.

There's no possibility of, say, Poison'd winning an Ennie, much though I'd love that.<br/><br/>Really, I think the Ennies would be much more at ease with itself if it gave up the pretence of objectivity and, instead of saying "We're rewarding the best games", waved its hands a little and said "We're just rewarding games we like".<br/><br/>Graham                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156838/#Comment_156838" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-16T06:51:29+00:00" title="July 16, 2008  6:51AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lacuna, Dictionary of Mu, Dawning Star, Burning Empires, Spirit of the Century - these are some of the 2007 nominees.

Looking over the actual <i>winners</i> of 2007, I only see <i>SotC</i> with a silver. Meanwhile, <i>M&amp;M Ultimate Power</i> raked in four gold and silver; and <i>Ptolus</i>--a mega-module, basically--landed three. RE the latter: categories like "best cartography" and "best adventure" skew strongly towards modules, I'd bet; and two art categories, a mini category (typically all-about-the-look, with value-add a close second--i.e. cheap AND pretty), and a production value category skew towards publishers with the money to by the year's best art, full-color print runs, and top layout artists and editors.<br/><br/>All THAT said, indie can roll with the top publishers--one look at <i>Burning Empires</i> should put to rest any notions that "indie = cheap"--but few <i>soloists</i> can expect to hang with WotC, WW, or even Mongoose. By soloist, I mean someone who writes the whole book, with only minimal editorial support (and few or no contributing authors), and who must have a catch-as-catch-can, low-price, or public domain approach to artwork. This is understandable, even, as a soloist is probably working for a living, paying bills and mortgages, and just can't risk their 401K on thousands of dollars of artwork, professional layout (and advertising support) services, and a series of editors and proofreaders. And, frankly, it doesn't hurt at all to have legions of slavering fans who'd "beta" or playtest a nascent product over and over again just to see their name "in lights."<br/><br/>'So what?' you might be thinking (thanks for reading all the way to the third paragraph!). Well, I'll summarize my thoughts with a metaphor: few Golden Globe darlings go to the Oscars... and even <i>fewer</i> Sundance winners. Small-press, independent publishers probably should look to other venues for accolades and awards. This point goes above and beyond "popularity," though that 's a major issue. Rather, I think most of the marginalization can be attributed to the nature of the market's most-common offerings, to the up-scaling of gaming materials in general over the decades, and to a categorization scheme which most-rewards those games with the most capital investment in production and promotion/marketing. The indie publisher can only really hope for best writing, rules, and (maybe) setting, as I see it (if you're like Ron, Rafael, or Luke, you get a crack at best supplement, too!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156851/#Comment_156851" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-16T08:00:49+00:00" title="July 16, 2008  8:00AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's also the "best monster/adversary product" category this year, which skews to a specific style of <i>publishing</i>, not just a specific style of play.<br/><br/>Still, I think it's cool that Denise and the rest of the ENnies staff seems interested in trying to cover a broader range of games, even if it may take another 5 years to progress towards that goal, assuming it ever does happen.  Pretty much every year they come and ask for our participation and some people take them up on it and some people turn them down, which is to be expected with a diverse crowd of people with different publishing goals.  Yeah, it definitely sucks for us that the awards are still tilted towards big publishers and certain styles of play, but there's certainly been some progress made from the all-d20 beginnings of the awards.  Whether it's ultimately worth it for indie games to keep playing second fiddle in the ENnies instead of focusing our attention elsewhere, who knows.

I created the Indie RPG Awards a few years back, and when I saw what the Ennies were doing with d20 (at the time), I was like, "Damn, that's a tight ship".<br/><br/>Luke's issues are right, I think, in terms of Too Much Product to review for such a huge range of categories and games. And I'd totally not want to shiv in a "best in class" style award (I forget which group but they basically award every car a "best in class" award for a kickback; Shit like "Car X gets an award for being "Best In Class for Backseat Passenger Safety in a Domestic-Produced 5-Door SUV Ranged Between 15000-17000 Pounds") just to give poncey games a fighting chance or whatever.<br/><br/>I'm very mixed on how I view awards these days, but I really respect what the EnWorld crew is trying to do (and has done for the past four years at least in terms of expanding outside the d20 market), and how they go about doing it. And every year they seem to get better at moving towards their goals.

The opposite would be like demanding bizarro categories (at least, bizarro to the EnNies/field in general) in order to place, like:<br/>"Best Relationship Map"<br/>"Best System for Conflict-Driven Narrative Play"<br/>"Best Cover Art/Layout that a Friend Did for Free"<br/>"Best Game that will Make You Cry"<br/>"Best Report of Actual Play Based on that Game"<br/><br/>Also, one problem with awards in general is that going about the process of setting them up, it doesn't matter how good your intentions are to want to basically throw a "grats" out to those that keep this cottage industry afloat, lively and active; there will always be cracks, issues that can not be addressed, incommensurables, and people left cold (by the focus, by the process, by the winners, etc). It's a thankless task, but I've seen Denise for like 3 years now step up to the plate and take her blows trying to make the awards more inclusive, and little by little she's making gains across the board. Sure, there's not gonna be a revolution or something next year, and it's probably going to be like a line which always nears the goal but never quite makes it, but each year it gets that much closer. At least, that's what I see, from looking at these awards over the last few years.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156954/#Comment_156954" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-16T11:46:07+00:00" title="July 16, 2008 11:46AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, folks--I didn't say the ENnies are "bad." I said that <i>I suspect that</i> the judging process skews to large publishers, based on the categories. In as much as the ENnie folks pick the categories, they share a modicum of the credit/blame for that skewing, but no more--it's the judge's call, after all (part of the "popularity contest" point others have made); and we fans put them there to represent us (the rest of the popularity contest--a high-profile D&amp;D grognard onENWorld or RPG.net is more likely known by "the public" than even our beloved Rons and Andys and Jasons).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>I fail to see how that's you being marginalized.</blockquote>\nMaybe a bad choice of words. "Selected against," in the Darwinian sense, based on the proscribed categories (the number of "exploitable niches in the environment") of the ENnies. Better?<br/><br/>For instance, if the categories included "Best GMless Play" and "Best-enables Compelling Stories" and "Best Game with no Fortune Mechanic" we'd have more niches to exploit. Instead, a lot of them (SEEM to, SEEM to, to me, OK?) skew to those what got big bucks.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>I think there's a sense of entitlement in going "We should have the option of participating in all fields", just like an athelete doesn't try to compete in all fields.</blockquote>\nHuh? (I hate text communications, for any sort of "touchy" issue.)<br/><br/>Many indie games have no call for "adventures" or modules or even cartography. Hence, indie publishers self-select--as you seem to say--against being in such a category. Meanwhile, D&amp;D has a HUGE market for modules, and a big tactical element, and so they have self-selected to be in a position where a lot of their module content is eligible for several categories simultaneously. Sure, we "can" drop a couple hundred thousand dollars to develop a game--and even remain "indie" if we self-publish--but I bet you can count on one hand the indie developers with that kind of budget. Meanwhile, it'll take all your fingers and toes to count the RPG publishers who could at least theoretically marshal such resources to deliver a product.<br/><br/>My only germane point (I should be less verbose) was that a lot of "our style games" in indie publishing don't map to nearly as many categories as a product like a module; further, our (typically) low-budget operations preclude us from having any real competitive chance, in still-other categories. If you re-read (tedious, I know), you'll see that I posited that we can only reasonably run in three categories. But as I just pointed out in the last paragraph, ONE MODULE could theoretically win in NINE categories:<br/>Best Cover Art and Interior Art and Production Values (spend enough and one can wrap these up with no contest)<br/>Best Writing (dialog, plotting, interesting advice on running the module)<br/>Best Rules (new classes, races, or means of adjudicating module-specific situation--suppose someone invented Duel of Wits as part of a module's diplomatic encounter stage?)<br/>Best Cartography and Miniature Product (think of the maps in the D&amp;D4E intro module--usable with your minis, and also "cartography," and surely helping out "production value" standings)<br/>Best Adventure (the main category itself)<br/>Best Setting (as with Best Rules--a new world in which the module is set... or a gargantuan city module: Ptolus, last year's Gold Winner)<br/><br/>Note that this list is also true of the "supplement only" companies you mention as being supposedly similarly benighted (or self-hamstringing, whatever).<br/><br/>In closing, Guy, if you're positing that we made our choice so quit whining... yeah, uh, I think that's basically what I said above:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>'So what?' you might be thinking. <span style="color: #0033CC;">[edit - "I don't see the issue" is pretty much the same as asking "So what?"]</span> Well, I'll summarize my thoughts with a metaphor: few Golden Globe darlings go to the Oscars... and even<i>fewer</i>Sundance winners. Small-press, independent publishers probably should look to other venues for accolades and awards.</blockquote>\nAnd that's all I'm really "adding" to this discussion, beyond some interesting (IMO) points about how some products can overlap many categories while others simply can't.<br/><br/>Some athletes <i>do</i> compete in the decathlon, not just the pole vault; and, no, the pole vaulters shouldn't bitch that they don't have a shot at a javelin medal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_157018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zacharythefirst" title="zacharythefirst"><img alt="zacharythefirst" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zacharythefirst">zacharythefirst</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157018/#Comment_157018" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-16T15:47:49+00:00" title="July 16, 2008  3:47PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2008 3:51PM by zacharythefirst.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite>A judge needs to have an open mind, being willing to fulfill the obligations of the honor bestowed upon him, and give every product a fair look, whomever may have written or published it.</blockquote>\nZachary, see, this is one of the things that bothers me about the Ennies. (This will sound like criticism for criticism's sake, but it's not, and I hope it's helpful).<br/><br/>There's an atmosphere of objectivity: you're looking for<i>excellence</i>, it doesn't matter who published it, you'll consider anything, and so on.<br/><br/>But, in reality, the awards are subjective, like all awards. You're a bunch of guys who like mainstream games. There's no possibility of, say, Poison'd winning an Ennie, much though I'd love that.<br/><br/>Really, I think the Ennies would be much more at ease with itself if it gave up the pretence of objectivity and, instead of saying "We're rewarding the best games", waved its hands a little and said "We're just rewarding games we like".<br/><br/>Graham<br/><br/>Graham,  <br/><br/>Hey, thanks for the response.  And I really appreciate the feedback.  I think a lot of ground has been covered since I posted my comment, but I just want to add:  I do like a lot of mainstream games.  I do like a lot of indie games, small press games, and game its likely me and only 4 other people have played.  And I can promise you, I really don't give a damn about who made what--so long as it rocks my world.  True 20 has done this.  Rules Cyclopedia D&amp;D has done this.  Burning Wheel has done this, as have Lacuna, Traveller, Don't Rest Your Head, and Two-Fisted Tales.<br/><br/>Its funny, I have emails in my inbox right now accusing me of catering too much towards "hippie games" as a judge, and others decrying me as a shill for WotC.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  All I can stand by is my communication with folks as a judge, and vote how I feel is best, and my assurances to you that any product, as long as I am a judge, regardless of who made it or what label is on it, will get a fair look-see and actual play/demo as far as I'm able.  Now, will a full-color hardcover from Company X likely beat out someone's Xeroxedm stapled ruleset in Best Production Values?  Likely, but that hardcover might be ass and the Xerox rock when it comes to Rules, Writing, Best Game, or many other categories.  I think if you look at the nearly 50 different companies represented this year, you see a huge variety in representation amongst those who actually submitted products.<br/><br/>At that, another thing to remember is we can only vote for and consider products that have been submitted.  I am definitely in favor of any amendments to the process that make the ENnies accessible and inclusive for the biggest bunch of entrants possible, but if a game isn't submitted in the first place, no matter how much I may personally love it, I can't do a thing about it as a judge.<br/><br/>As for the fan voting, at this point, all I can do is cast my votes like anyone else. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Luke:  SotC did get a Silver ENnie last year for Best Rules!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_157117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157117/#Comment_157117" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-17T06:20:13+00:00" title="July 17, 2008  6:20AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris, I organized the Summer Revolution.

I was there last year, soaking up the atmos and the vodka sours and I was ... well, disappointed. Put it this way, the next day me and my buddy went to find a copy of the All Conquering Mutants and Masterminds Supplement of Doom to see just how special it was and it wasn't. It won oodles of awards by getting nominated and then having a fuckton of fans of the product who were willing to vote and vote hard. Now that in and of itself might be good enough, but for me at least, it was a bit of a let down. On a number of categories, the best man didn't win - the biggest vote base won.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I can see why games with a small vote base would be hugely discouraged from even entering. Why waste a piece of product in a competition where a nomination is feasibly the highest accolade you can expect.

A serious suggestion Zach and Denise. I can only speak of small press here but it should apply across the barrier. Primary, make it cheap to enter. For some guys six copies are a hardship. Electronic submission helps but it is difficult to judge the print quality of a print book submitted in electronic form. So, work the other end of the equation. Value of a nomination. Some ideas on that would be:<br/>Promote the list to sites. I mean, really work it. Get stickey threads on RPG.Net and EnWorld. Get them listed everywhere and keep them current up to GenCon. You already cover this pretty well but I wanted to stress it.<br/><br/>Second, for me at least, promotion to retailers. Stickers or the like for their products. Lists they can hand out. Hell, get ahold of Aldo at impressions and get articles in Gamebuyer about it. Likewise for KODT. Bonus points for Wired or IVC2 or even local papers or some such. Generally, extend the promotion of the nominations.<br/><br/>In the end, this will allow for higher value, making the expense of 6 copies and postage to be quite reasonable. Also, good move on having the sixth copy go to a US address. Sorry, but Canada/US border has some rough customs. That helped me.<br/><br/>Now, you might want to consider a kiddie table category like "Best Indie" or some such but I personally find that kind of thing counter productive. I was involved in the Origins Awards debacle some time ago and debates on categories are a pain. They seldom pay off the way folks think. Still, if there was something that universally cut across lines (I have no idea what that would be) it could always be added. I do not think a "Just Indie" category would be good though. Some folks have pointed out that you have an adventure category that somehow excludes indies...I don't see it. They could make an adventure if they wanted and subsequently enter it. I did but then, maybe I am misunderstanding the point. So, I am not a fan of putting a bunch of new categories in but one would be good. It should not be limited to indies though but maybe a strength they represent...I leave that to those who know indies better than me.<br/><br/>Bill                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_157335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denise" title="Denise"><img alt="Denise" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denise">Denise</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157335/#Comment_157335" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-18T08:25:03+00:00" title="July 18, 2008  8:25AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To answer some other concerns- there are indie awards out there already, so I don't feel that we have to, nor should we, create an indie category.  This may come across as callous, but like it or not, these are the RPG Awards, and the majority of gamers in the world play conventional RPGs released by big presses.  And I don't like the "kiddie" table concept- indie/small press products are of a sufficient quality to be able to stand on their own when it comes to judge evaluation, and I don't want to imply otherwise by giving them a hand-out category.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe judges evaluate each product based on its own merit and many judges in the past have selected small press and/or indie titles.  Help choose how next year's products will be evaluated by supporting judges whom you think best reflect your values.  Nomination package and details for the 2009 Judging Panel are up at the ENnies page on the Voting section.<br/>\nOr you can just use this: <a href="http://www.ennieawards.com/08/09JudgeNoms.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.ennieawards.com/08/09JudgeNoms.pdf</a>  Voting for judges runs August 4-10th.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for creating a category that isn't necessarily indie-only but would be heavily slanted in indie favour, I'm really not keen on that concept.  BUT if someone came up with suggestions with viable categories that weren't too prejudicial, I would be willing to consider them.  For example, what about Best Non-Traditional RPG.  This could include crossover card/board rpgs, online gaming, LARP, diceless systems, whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf indie publishers want to be considered on the same playing field as more traditional/mainstream games, then welcome to the ENnies!  It's not unheard of for smaller press to receive nominations and medal, and the additional exposure (and we're constantly working on new ways to spread the word IRL, for example this year's grassroots campaign) for a less-known title can be quite beneficial interest and sales-wise.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you all for your constructive comments, I hope you'll continue participating in the process at some level, whether it's supporting a judge, voting at the Awards, submitting product for consideration, putting up a poster at the local gaming store, donating something for the silent auction, or buying a "dream date" package.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_157338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157338/#Comment_157338" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-18T08:44:53+00:00" title="July 18, 2008  8:44AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What is this Grassroots campaign?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_157352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157352/#Comment_157352" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-18T09:47:00+00:00" title="July 18, 2008  9:47AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>What is this Grassroots campaign?</blockquote>\nI believe it involves their efforts to get supporters to post ads at local gaming shops.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_157364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denise" title="Denise"><img alt="Denise" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denise">Denise</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157364/#Comment_157364" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-18T10:12:34+00:00" title="July 18, 2008 10:12AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, that's the basics of it for now.<br/>\nPut up <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.ennieawards.com/08/storeflyer.pdf" rel="nofollow">the poster</a> at a FLGS and we'll include a link to the store (or if it doesn't have a web page, include its mailing address) as a thank you for them for showing their support of the ENnies.

I think anything that can be done to increase the value of the awards helps offset any sort of submission cost to the publisher.  If you see any other opportunities for the ENnies to help in that regard aside from the list you've done, let me know and I'll send it on up the line.  And thanks for the thought on it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7035/ennies-indie-publisher-involvement" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7035/ennies-indie-publisher-involvement" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7035/ennies-indie-publisher-involvement/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F7035%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F7035%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
