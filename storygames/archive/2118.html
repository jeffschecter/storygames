                    I had my first session of The Mountain Witch tonight, and I feel like it went really well!<br/><br/>It took a little longer than I'd hoped to get through the explanation of the rules and character generation, in part because we were also eating and chit-chatting.  Also, in some ways I was still clarifying the rules to myself, because I often have trouble grasping things completely until people start asking me questions.  I think that all took about an hour and a quarter.  I started out by giving an overview of the game, then passed out Dark Fates.  At this point, I realized that people were still really foggy on everything, so I handed out the zodiac character sheets (so they could have the conflict resolution stuff in front of them) and started from the beginning, explaining conflict resolution, trust points, and re-explaining the basic bent of the game.  One player in particular, Tim, seemed kind of confused about the boundaries of what he could and couldn't bring into play in terms of his Fate -- what kind of NPCs he could introduce, etc.  It seemed to help when I reminded him that the scope of the game is pretty tight.<br/><br/>One thing that helped everyone in terms of narrating Fates, I think, was that we discussed de-protagonizing and how kosher it was to, say, announce one's undying love for another PC, or suddenly reveal that another PC is your father's lover, or something like that.  The players decided that as a group they were up for these kinds of soap opera revelations, even though in a longer-term campaign they would be frustrating and annoying.  The general feeling was that since it's a short game, you want to make it pretty much as twisted and fraught with drama as possible, and people were willing to allow others to mess with their characters to a certain extent.<br/><br/>We ended up with a full house of six players.  I'm totally impressed with the range of abilities they came up with.  At first a couple people had a little trouble coming up with stuff, but after everyone started sharing what abilities they'd chosen, it helped the stragglers get comfortable with their choices.  So we ended up with:<br/><br/>Josh M. : Ichi, An old, crotchety man.  He's got:  <br/>A family heirloom bow that never misses anything within normal bow range ("so if I fail my roll," said Josh, "it'll be because something prevents me from firing, of course!")<br/>Premonitions<br/>ability to jump around in true wuxia fashion.<br/><br/>Josh C.: Sadako, a female ronin who was once beautiful, but is now very severe.<br/>Stealthy &amp; Silent<br/>Acid tongue<br/>Kinship with the unclean<br/><br/>Hannah: Yasunari, a middle-aged man<br/>He is in thrall to a demon, which can sometimes offer information that he otherwise wouldn't have<br/>He can shapeshift into animal shapes (thanks to the demon)<br/>He can talk to the dead.<br/><br/>Tim: Yoshi, young, but experienced and meticulous.<br/>He has fabled armor that has never been pierced<br/>Super-sensitive hearing<br/>Walks through walls<br/><br/>Shy: Kenzo, a very young man, formerly was basically a cop<br/>He has a sword breaker<br/>He is an expert in rope bondage/torture/restraint<br/>He is a poisoner<br/><br/>Dave: Shitake, a very odd middle-aged fellow<br/>He can pass into a shadow in one location and emerge somewhere else<br/>He is friendly with forest spirits<br/>He is a master carpenter<br/><br/>I was initially worried about the magical bow and armor, and kept repeating that they would offer no mechanical advantage.  I think they both understand, but I'm not sure how useful the bow and armor are going to be for them because of this.  We'll see, though.                </div>

                            Ok, AP...<br/><br/>Once we'd gotten the characters on paper, I explained that they had all been approached by messengers from the lord local to the area O-Yanma controls.  As things stand he is the ruler of the land in name only; everyone is really under O-Yanma's thrall.  So he has offered a sizeable monetary reward to those who kill O-Yanma, along with his patronage and thus the restoration of their honor, should they wish it.  I then told the players that they had been told to meet their associates at a shrine at the edge of the forest at the base of Mt. Fuji, and had them each narrate their journey and what they were doing as they approached the designated meeting place.  Hannah (Yusinari) in particular had some fun, describing how her character paused frequently to burn small pieces of his garments and murmer what sounded like one half of a conversation.  Shy (Kenzo) had his arrogant young cop encounter Sadako (Josh C.) and immediately assume that she was in need of escort, much to her annoyance.  Once at the shrine, someone asked what kind of shrine it was, how big, etc.  I said, "I don't know, what's it like?" and Tim (Yoshi) immediately jumped in and explained that it was a family shrine and belonged to the abandoned farm nearby.  Awesome.<br/><br/>After some banter and argument, I told them that they heard keening cries coming from the forest.  Yoshi and Sadako immediately rushed off to locate the source of the cries -- at which point I said that there were answering cries from other parts of the forest, and that they were apparently the sounds of creatures communicating, rather than screams of distress (what was awesome about this is that I hadn't even meant them to mistake them for the screams of someone in danger -- I just told them they heard high-pitched keening cries, and they jumped to the conclusion that someone was in trouble).  Meanwhile, the rest of the crew at the shrine argued about why they were there and what exactly was going on, finally following after the cries continued.<br/><br/>Yoshi and Sadako chose to leave the path in search of the creature.  We had a contest to see whether they would find the creature (Tim's stakes) or be drawn off the path and lost (my stakes).  We tied, and Tim declared Ai-Uchi and chose to take Damage in order to find the creature but not be lost (I think this was kosher; it was a little difficult to work out just how it was supposed to work ruleswise, but we were happy with the result).  They encountered a single kijo, wielding a club.  Sadako dealt it a chapter wound.  Meanwhile, Yasunari transformed into a kijo with the help of his demon, and ran to try to intervene and talk the rest of the kijo down.  This turned out to be an awesome three-way contest, as Sadako turned to shoot the new kijo, Yasu attempted to dodge the blow, and Kenzo (who had been privy to the transformation) dove for Sadako to prevent her shooting Yasu.  It was very thrilling -- Hannah totally blew her roll, but Shy rolled higher than Josh C., and thus disaster was averted.  Everyone regrouped, at which point it became clear that Shitake was missing.  He had actually attempted to pass through shadows and thus find the rest of the group more quickly, but made an error and ended up high in a tree some distance away.  <br/><br/>Sadako and Ichi (Josh M.) then very nearly came to a social duel over whether the group would keep going or go look for Shitake!  Instead we called it a social contest.  Ichi got a critical success, which Josh M. narrated as Sadako having a permanent wound in social contests with Ichi from then on.  Again, I wasn't 100% sure this was provided for in the rules, but I thought it was a totally awesome outcome.  Sadako was cowed, and they went to look for Shitake.<br/><br/>There was a little bit more, but I'm really tired and need to sleep, so I'll finish up the AP and offer my thoughts tomorrow morning.  Overall I'm super, super pleased with how it went.  In particular, I'm really psyched at how quickly Josh C. started going for peoples' throats. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Shitake was able to rejoin the rest of the party, thanks to the amount of noise they were making in their argument.  There was some debate over what to do next, as no one was really sure how to get back to the path.  At this point, Jiro, a woodcutter, happened by, and graciously invited the samurai to share his hospitality for the evening.  Everyone accepted, and he took them to his humble home, where they met his wife Meguni, his teenage daughter Emi, and his eight-year-old daughter, Hiroko.  Emi entertained the guests with music and singing (casting many blushing glances at young Kenzo), while Yasu ventered to the stream outside and, taking an otter shape, caught fish for dinner.  Sadako retreated farther down the river to bathe, and she and Yasu cagily exchanged words of greeting.  Yasu expressed that Sadako looked familiar.<br/><br/>Inside, Yoshi questioned the family about a local clan who was rumored to be somehow linked to the Witch, and who he suspected may have access to protection against O-Yanma's powers.  The family was reticent, but Ichi and Kenzo were able to charm Hiroko into explaining that the clearing around the house was safe, but the woods were treacherous.  She expressed particular fear of "The White Lady," who lived with O-Yanma and had a particular fondness for children and young men. <br/><br/>After sharing dinner, Yasu went back outside (by this time it was full dark) and walked to the edge of the clearing.  Here he spoke with a gaki.  He tried to question the gaki about the forest and the witch, but it only demanded food, and was not satisfied with the rice Yasu offered.  Fortunately, Yasu was inside the clearing, and the gaki was unable to reach him.  He left her and the other spirits howling with frustration and pacing the perimeter of the clearing.<br/><br/>The session ended with the men bedding down in the main room, and Sadako sharing quarters with the family in their sleeping chamber.  It remains to be seen whether they will pass a quiet night...<br/><br/>* * * <br/><br/>Once things got going, I really started to have fun with this.  At first I was nervous and worried about explaining the mechanics, but everyone pretty much immediately took ownership of their character.  They had me grinning throughout the session as they interacted and came up with solutions.  The only player who seemed a little adrift was Dave (Shitake); I tried to draw him out a couple of times by asking him directly what Shitake was doing, and he participated, but didn't take control of narration much at all.  I talked to him afterward (he's also my boyfriend) and he basically said he was just exhausted and would be more with-it next session.  I'm going to try to target his character a little more and force him to act on some stuff.<br/><br/>There was some confusion over success and Damage.  I think it was everyone's tendency to want to assign damage with every conflict, physical or not, the way you would in TSOY.  My feeling was that wounds were more of a matter of physical conflict, although I also liked Josh M.'s proposal of assigning a permanent social wound to Sadako.  I think we'll probably end up doing it on a case-by-case basis, depending on what seems appropriate.<br/><br/>My only real "D'oh!" moment as GM was during Yasu's encounter with the gaki.  I was confused over whether he was supposed to be within the perimeter of the clearing or not, and asked Hannah where he was.  In retrospect, I wish I would have just had the gaki attempt to attack Yasu, and then Hannah could have told me whether he was within the safe zone or not.  Not a big deal, but the encounter lost some energy because of it.<br/><br/>My biggest concerns right now mostly involve pacing and the Dark Fates.  This session went much more slowly than I had hoped, in part because explaining the rules and chargen took longer than I'd planned.  I think I'm going to have to press people to pick up the pace a little in the next session.  It's tough, though, because I don't want to rob the players of the opportunity to develop their relationships with each other.<br/><br/>The main thing with the Fates is that I know people are dropping hints, and I find myself overly concerned over whether I'm going to be able to figure out what their Fates are.  I think I'm focusing too much on figuring it out, though -- what I really need to do is focus on what the players are pushing for and respond to their cues.  I'm going to remind them, though, that it's not necessary or even desired for them to keep their Fates secret up until the bitter end.<br/><br/>On a side note, I think my favorite thing about the session last night was just watching how much fun Josh C. was having.  He kept saying how much he was digging being a player (he's our usual GM, and has been GMing almost exclusively for a while).  So, very successful, and I'm definitely looking forward to the next session on Saturday!                        </div>

                            I'm glad the game is going so well! Once the ball gets rolling, the game is actually pretty easy to GM, the players come up with all the good stuff!

Damage is TOTALLY appropriate for non-fighty or "social" conflicts. As I say in the book, all conflict is a form of combat. But here's something to remember---you can EITHER narrate a fact or inflict damage. Along with that, inflicting Damage isn't considered "resolving" a conflict. It sounds like maybe your players want to narrate facts and Damage at the same time. Is that correct?<br/><br/>Also, Damage is Damage, all conflict is combat. Taking a Wound in a fight is going to lower your ability to debate and persuade, just as losing some of your honor (social conflict) is going to enbolden your enemies in a fight---in other words, losing a debate is going to harm your ability to fight. Sadako's social Wound should be applied to ALL conflicts. Sorry, dem's the breaks. Conflict is serious stuff, and you should pick your battles. Sadako's been hurt for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>Be tough, don't let Sadako off easy. That Wound might fuel some good tension between him and Ichi. Also, now Sadako is forced to rely on others for Aiding, which will mean he will have to play more of a "social" game with the other PCs. It's all good! I mean it.
<blockquote>My biggest concerns right now mostly involve pacing and the Dark Fates.

Why do you feel it went slow? Were players getting bored? It sounds like everyone was having fun.<br/><br/>I say this over and over---when given it's due time, tMW takes alot longer than expected. My personal games last 4 or 5 sessions. IME, one Chapter takes ~2 hours of real time. Also, be aware that the early Chapters start off slow, but the game picks up steam as the game progresses. Tensions need to stew in their own juices for a while to get the the maximum effect.<br/><br/>My advice is don't worry, let the game run its course. Just <i>trust</i> that the run will work out in the end.
<blockquote>The main thing with the Fates is that I know people are dropping hints, and I find myself overly concerned over whether I'm going to be able to figure out what their Fates are.

If all they're doing is dropping hints, don't sweat it. When the time is right, they'll full out reveal the Fate, and that's your cue. There shouldn't be a need to guess. If they haven't outright revealed it, then they're not ready to deal with it. Just wait.<br/><br/>If the game goes on for too long without anyone revealing, you can "remind" players that they should be moving towards revelation. I only do this when it seems players are purposely avoiding their Fates. If they stay engaged and keep dropping hints and stuff, I don't sweat it. You can also use the ol', "I won't change the Chapter if you don't start doing Fate stuff."
<blockquote>Josh M. : Ichi, An old, crotchety man.

Have you read my <a href="http://www.timfire.com/MountainWitch/MW_clarifications.html#narration" rel="nofollow">clarification on narration</a>? It gives different ways to interpret failures. That might help you and Josh narrate Ichi's bow ability.<br/><br/>You should be careful with Yasunari's demon advisor. If Hannah is going to be creating facts, it should be Fate related. I would NOT let her narrate the demon unless it was Fate-related. But the demon can be a good tool for you to mess with Yaunari. The demon could tell "false" or other information that cause the other PCs to doubt Yasunari's loyalty or honesty.                        </div>

Yeah, that's pretty much what's going on; I think a lot of the problem is that we're coming directly from TSOY, which uses wounds in a way more closely akin to what occurred last night with Sadako.  To make sure I'm understanding the rules properly now: <br/><br/>In the conflict between Sadako and Ichi, Ichi's intention was to convince Sadako that the group should search for Shitake, even if it meant a delay.  Since Josh M. scored a critical success, it would have been an option for him to narrate that his character convinced Sadako, plus shamed her in such a way that she would defer to him from then on, OR narrate a permanent wound (applicable in all conflicts).  Am I right?
<blockquote>Why do you feel it went slow? Were players getting bored? It sounds like everyone was having fun.</blockquote>
Nah, you're right -- the pace of the conflicts and scenes and everything was all great.  It was pretty action-packed, in comparison to our usual pace, honestly, which I think is awesome (and is kind of a relief).  Everyone had a good time.  It's more than in real world terms, it's going to be hard to get everyone together for more than three sessions (two of my players are going to Kenya for three weeks very soon), so I'm feeling a little pressure in that way.  OTOH, I don't think anyone's going to be particuarly annoyed if we have to go longer than we'd planned, as long as everything continues to be as much fun as it has been.  And I don't want to rush things.
<blockquote>You should be careful with Yasunari's demon advisor. If Hannah is going to be creating facts, it should be Fate related. I would NOT let her narrate the demon unless it was Fate-related. </blockquote>
Yeah, so far when her PC's asked the demon for information, I've done the narrating.  For example, last night she called up the demon to ask what the creatures that were surrounding them (the kijo) were and what they looked like, so that her character could transform into one, and I played the demon.  It's a good thing to keep in mind, though.  Same thing with Ichi's promonitions.<br/><br/>Thanks so much for your comments -- you've been really helpful!                        </div>

                            Sure, I'll give it a shot.<br/>In this session, all the bangs were intended to be fairly generic, rather than pushing any specific Fate-related buttons; I mostly wanted to give people a chance to learn the mechanics and such.  I planned the encounter with the kijo just as a sort of introductory battle, but in-game it ended up being quite a bit more interesting thanks to the players' reactions.  The other major bang I prepped was the encounter with Jiro, the woodcutter, which was one of those things that could have gone any number of ways; I really wasn't sure if the players would all decide to acompany him, or if they would split up.<br/><br/>I prepped a whole bunch of encounters/bangs that I ended up not using this time around, although I modified some of them for the next session.                        </div>
