Here are the rules for play:<br/><br/>Your team consists of five players, each with one 6th-level character created according to the rules listed above. You will need to provide the DM with the name of your team when you sit down and get ready to play. <br/>You will have 45 minutes to complete each encounter from the time the DM starts the clock. Once you finish one encounter and tell the DM you are ready to begin the next one, the timer will begin on the next encounter. Fast play and quick decision-making are critical to completing an encounter within the allotted time. The clock will always be ticking from the time you begin play, so be sure to monitor it. <br/>Your group may take short rests between encounters when possible but may not take an extended rest at any point during the Ultimate Dungeon Delve. Deliberation during a short rest counts during your game time for either the encounter you've just completed or your next one, depending on the team's decision. <br/>Characters that die during the Ultimate Dungeon Delve are out of play. You may take a fallen comrade's gear with you during the remainder of the adventure. Players that have a dead character may not help the other players for the remainder of the adventure, but they may continue to observe. Players of dead characters are still rewarded if the team manages to complete the Ultimate Dungeon Delve. <br/>Your team is eliminated from the Ultimate Dungeon Delve if any one of the following occurs: your characters take an extended rest, all the characters are killed, the team decides by majority vote to stop play, or time runs out before an encounter is finished. <br/><br/><b>Prizes</b><br/><br/>Teams that successfully complete all six encounters within the allotted time will each receive copies of new D&amp;D game product and will have their characters placed in the Ultimate Dungeon Delve Hall of Fame!<br/><br/><b>Adventure Descriptions</b><br/><br/>There are two adventures for this season's Ultimate Dungeon Delve. The first, The Lunar Awakening, plays at Origins and San Diego Comic-Con. The second adventure, Fall of the Tower at Windrock, plays at Gen Con Indy, PAX, and Gen Con Australia. The descriptions for each are listed below.<br/><br/><b>The Lunar Awakening</b><br/>The howls grew louder and louder until one night they were upon us. The myths and stories, they were all true. The primal urges of our people were too strong for the old apothecary's snake oil. But there's more; more dread I dare say. Someone or something is awaking the victims of these bestial men, to walk the earth again as living dead! How can we stop them? Who can help us overcome the Lunar Awakening? An Ultimate Dungeon Delve adventure for five 6th-level characters.<br/><br/><b>Fall of the Tower at Windrock</b><br/>Floating on an earthmote above a verdant island realm, the enigmatic wizard, Kelleck, once built a magnificent tower as a beacon of hope to the villages of Windrock below. Now, word has reached far and wide that the tower has crumbled, and whispers of the wizard's demise have reached the ears of many adventurers. What has become of Kelleck, and who now will keep the villages safe? An Ultimate Dungeon Delve adventure for five 6th-level characters.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213346/#Comment_213346" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-19T08:02:06+00:00" title="June 19, 2009  8:02AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe!
