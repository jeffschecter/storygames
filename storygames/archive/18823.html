Of all the superhero games I've played (old school DC by Mayfair, the old Marvel, Aberrant, Mutants and Masterminds, and I feel good throwing BESM into the mix), all are pretty much physics-based games. But there are so many good story elements, it seems strange that there isn't a narrative-based game. Or if there is, I don't know of it.

I put it down, and didn't think much about it. A few months ago I started up a superhero mini campaign using BASH UE, and pretty quickly got frustrated with some of its fiddlyness. Then I saw someone commenting about how much they liked Supers!, so I hauled it out and read it again. The second reading gave me the same impression as the first, but I decided to give it a go and converted the game over to Supers!...<br/><br/>I could not have made a better choice. <br/><br/>In play, Supers! is quick, fun, and evokes the feel of comic books unlike any other superhero RPG that I have ever played (and I've played most all of them).<br/><br/>I strongly urge everyone to give Supers! a try, and the Revised Edition certainly looks like it's going to smooth a few rough edges off.</blockquote>\n<br/>Supers! is narrative, but with a system that still feels tactical in that you can usually only use a power once per round, so if you are making multiple attacks, defense moves or other actions, you have to come up with descriptions on how you use your other powers or skills help you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JoshDemers" title="JoshDemers"><img alt="JoshDemers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/703/nLX7QIP4KZECH.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JoshDemers">JoshDemers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421714/#Comment_421714" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-20T16:19:10+00:00" title="September 20, 2013  4:19PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">@John_Powell</a>: Thanks!

So what do I like about it?<br/><br/>1. The chargen, specifically the random generator for the superpowers (which is most of it as there's no personality, it's a wham bam kind of game rather than one that supports a lot of in-character roleplaying, although you can of course roleplay a personality if you want). It looks quite complicated but isn't really, although it does take up a fair amount of time. The thing I like about it particularly is the fact that there's such a wide variety of abilities to select from.<br/><br/>2. The fact that whereas most table-top supers games try to replicate the feel of the movies, SqUK- in an extremely innovative move- seeks to emulate the feel of the actual <i>comics</i>, and the way it does this is by having the action happen in panels, IIRC the dice roll yielding the number of panels you can create on your turn. It's a bit analogous to a hex game, so if you are ten panels away from where you want to be, and you roll a six (I can't remember the d-size offhand) that's how many panels your action happens across, and if you're within range of your target, the villain has an opportunity to have a go at you, and you to defend yourself etc. (Sorry, I can't remember the combat rules).<br/><br/>3. It uses minis. Now I'm not a huge fan of minis- well, I'm a regular on a storygames forum, so it kinda figures- but I really like that aspect in this case, because again you can emulate the actions of your superhero flying through the air and landing on top of the bad guy etc. Plus they're beautifully designed.

I haven't read (the equally out of print...) Marvel Heroic yet, but on a skim it didn't quite seem what I was looking for either.<br/><br/>I just got around to trying Strange FATE a couple days ago (via Base Raiders, which has a nifty punk "buying superpowers on eBay to dungeon crawl through the Fortress of Solitude" theme, I haven't actually read Kerberos Club), and it looks like it might be hitting my roll-your-own-powers crunch sweet spot between Smallville on the lower end and Wild Talents on the "just out of my comfort zone" end (with HERO way out at "no, never ever").  I am a little concerned that the sort of HeroQuesty power-tier gimmick may be too swingy (for every "power level" of difference in a conflict, the more powerful one replaces one of their Fudge dice with a d6, so even one degree of difference throws the FATE math curve way out of whack), maybe replacing that with a d3 would be less bumpy, if less elegant.  I definitely want to mess around with it some more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simonpaulburley" title="Simonpaulburley"><img alt="Simonpaulburley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/525/nEVIULR78FJ45.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simonpaulburley">Simonpaulburley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421800/#Comment_421800" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-23T08:59:31+00:00" title="September 23, 2013  8:59AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>........ rather it's a battleship grey case which looks a bit like a workperson's tool-kit, and which contains the rulebook, the minis, all tastefully arranged, plus a bag for the dice.

We DO seem to meet up at odd places.<br/><br/>Thanks for the kind words and I hate to correct you but I don't know where you got battleship grey case from Squadron UK is a traditional rulebook. It think you may have been referring to to box I carry round for conventions. That's my own personal convention kit.<br/><br/>Though the rules are bloody brilliant - the best character generation system around, panel by panel simulation of the comics, your play in this scenario directly affects your success in others etc etc.  - i think in terms of this thread it falls into the physics based games referred to in the first post. SqUK and Golden Heroes and most other traditional SHRPGs assume that what you see in the comic is only a snippet of what happens. There's loads going on in the background and we play out every blow.<br/><br/>Now I've speeded things up for SqUK. You won't spend your whole evening on one battle, they is plenty of time for Roleplaying. However, as we've discussed at cons, I still think there may be room for another type of game which ups the Roleplaying between battles and reduces battle times. Traditional SHRPGs are like FIFA 2013 - the match is the focus. Do we need a game like FIFA manager - where its the planning and setup that's the key and the matches take care of themselves.<br/><br/>Not surprising that smallville is mentioned. All TV superhero shows have to sideline the battles for budget reasons. I'd also cite Heroes as  source to base a low-physics high character game on. The powers are much broader.<br/><br/>Sorry to woffle on. It IS my specialism.<br/><br/>Have you found the game you want or do you think I should write one?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg" title="semajmaharg"><img alt="semajmaharg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/n0TRVVHW3SOVY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg">semajmaharg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421804/#Comment_421804" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-23T09:44:40+00:00" title="September 23, 2013  9:44AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I ever get my Rule 63 supers game off the ground, I'd probably use Smallville.

Thinking about it now it seems fairly obvious that MWP would attempt to replicate the feel of the TV series as much as possible given that they had the licence for it.

It's been a while since I read <i>Icons</i>, but I seem to remember it having some similar mechanics.<br/><br/>A lot of supers games I've come across structure combat in a very similar, post-D&amp;D way.

Here's what I wrote: <br/><br/><br/>--- --- ---<br/><br/>Scenes during downtime provide opportunities for heroes to do many things, including (but not limited to):<br/>\u2022\thaving casual conversations with each other<br/>\u2022\thaving intense personal conversations with the other characters in their lives<br/>\u2022\tpursuing long-range goals<br/>\u2022\tinvestigating mysteries<br/>\u2022\tmaneuvering for advantage in upcoming encounters<br/><br/>Every hero gets one scene of downtime between encounters. Each hero can buy one extra scene of downtime by spending a PP.<br/><br/>The GM gets one scene of downtime between encounters. They can centre this around heroes or villains. <br/><br/><br/><b>Framing the scene</b><br/><br/>The person starting a scene of downtime answers three questions:<br/><br/>1.<br/>What do you want to do during the scene? Phrase this as the \u2018question\u2019 you want this scene to answer. (This will give you guidance on when to end the scene\u2014once the question has been answered.)<br/><br/>As an example, imagine that during the previous encounter the heroes learned there\u2019s trouble the AI controlling an orbital weapons platform. One of the players wants their scene of downtime to discuss what they\u2019ll do and who will go.

Sometimes that flows well, other times it doesn't--but there will be fallout from those scenes either way. <br/><br/>In H&amp;S2E, I require characters to come with three Stress Triggers (called Hooks) these hooks are people who they interact with--three in total.

Fudge worked the best. We were playing a very X-Men inspired campaign but with the serial numbers filed off and names changed. For example, the Jean Grey character was called Mesmeralda and her clone was called Klezmeralda. The team was called S-Men and the professor was called Professor Shaver.<br/><br/>The players were playing the junior team and we were playing c:a early New Mutants era (so Paul Smith era X-Men, with elements from the original Claremont Wolvie/Kitty miniseries), but the players were playing all original characters instead of NM based characters. The device of having them playing the junior team was good because then the senior S-Men characters could be more funny, more powerful, and didn\u2019t have to experience as surprising events\u2014it was fine that they were retreading ground from the comics. We all pitched in in describing their adventures. We had plenty of player contribution to what was happening.<br/><br/>It was fun. In the end, more of a fun game, than a serious tactical super powers game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon" title="Neonchameleon"><img alt="Neonchameleon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon">Neonchameleon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425155/#Comment_425155" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-03T15:58:23+00:00" title="December  3, 2013  3:58PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Two questions:<br/><br/>What are peoples' favorite superhero games?<br/><br/>Does anyone know of a good narrative-based superhero game?</blockquote>\nWhat am I trying to do?

If it's slightly larger than life pulp, Fate Core.  Cosmic Supers?  Probably Wushu.
