                    Rather than playing Savagery this week, Lia brought some of her students by and they requested <a href="http://wyrmwood.srgames.org/RPGs/ChristmasNinjas.pdf" rel="nofollow">Christmas Ninjas</a>. Earlier, I'd had the realization that Fudge dice were ideal for Christmas Ninjas, since the core mechanic revolves solely around matching outcomes on 3-sided dice. <br/><br/>Of the four players, three made Dire Penguins, one of whom was a Crooner, and one the Lutenist. The last character was a Giant Panda, who was the only one who'd taken Lawnjitsu - mastery of the lawn dart. He later regretted not taking Fleejitsu as he often had difficulty performing the physical stunts of his avian brethren. <br/><br/>They were sent on a mission to remove the vile Elven influence at the Hasboro main offices. Later they discovered the elf behind this was none other than Jaygolas, one of Santas uzi-weilding side-kicks. First the ninjas were air-dropped from a penguin shaped ornithopter over the installation, unfortunately the Panda failed to land safely, and was wounded. After the air drop they met their local contact, a Fox News correspondent who gave them a map of the offices with a coffee stain where he suspected the Elven HQ could be found. Wishing them luck he left the ninjas to their work.<br/><br/>Some hijinks occur as the panda throws the penguins one at a time through a back window. The later pair hit the wall the first time, but make it through the second. Unfortunately, while climbing the wall himself, the panda was laid upon by human guards. Beaten to an inch of his life (or 6 inches of hair...) he consumes a Twinkie and flees with his temporary Fleejitsu. <br/><br/>Meanwhile inside, the penguins have brutally handled both guards and an uzi and sword weilding Christmas elf (imagine a Legolas wannabe with an uzi). Missing their Panda back-up singer they decide to start playing - Lutenist, Crooner, and bassist, hoping to attract their mammalian ally.<br/><br/>However, the Panda has decided to try another route, the front door. Here he is told to wait by the receptionist, and does so sitting in the waiting room until out walk two more elves. He makes short work of them with his crochet needle, but the gig is up, as the receptionist hits the alarm. Fortunately the penguins hear the noise too and arrive just in time to deal with another few elves, these ones armed.<br/><br/>Capturing one of the elves, the ninjas decide to regroup, heading first to the cafeteria to hunt for wasabi (as a way to make the unclean food there palatable to the purity of the ninjas), as well as some Old Bay Seasoning. There they interrogate the captured elf, discovering that Jaygolas is in the building. Resolved to defeat this menace, and after a quick stop by the garbage collection area to make some dumpster snacks (for healing), the ninjas head to the secret elven HQ (or at least that's what the signs leading there say it is.)<br/><br/>When they arrive, they are taunted by the pretty-boy Jaygolas, and are charged by his elven minions. The bassist rapidly cooks the halibit with the Old Bay Seasoning, making the dreaded Old Bay Seasoned Halibut, tossing it to his panda friend, who immediately consumes it. Then with the awesome power it grants him he tosses a lawn dart and slays Jaygolas with one blow. (The Seasoned Halibut lets a ninja use the largest number of matches, rather than the smallest in one roll.)<br/><br/>The rest of the ninjas fight valiantly, but there is no stopping the elves who, singing now that their leader is dead, have actived the self-destruct system. The penguins flee, but alas, the panda does not make it out in time and is caught in the explosion. Given the choice between betraying his code to use a forbidden technique (and hence gaining 6 inches of hair) and dying in the blast he valiantly chooses the path of honor. Mourning their comrade the remaining ninjas flee and are exfiltrated in a Fox News van. Their vengence may not be swift, but it will be pointly.<br/><br/>All things considered this was a decent playtest, although I'm not sure how serious I am about revising the game. The balance mechanic worked well, as did the matching mechanic. The players suggested additional jistu, possibly optional replacement jitsu, such as knitjitsu in place of crochetjistu, for those heretics who use the knitting needle in place of the crochet needle. Other additions might include more GM guidance. You can only add so much in 4 hours...<br/><br/>   - Mendel S.                </div>

                            As an aside, we played the game in our local student union, and as it would have it had a few people watching. One of whom asked what we were doing. Apparently this was his first exposure to RPGs, he hadn't even heard of D&amp;D. I'm not sure if that's a good or a bad thing... But the improv with rules explaination does makes more sense when the rules don't involve fairly arcane calculations. <br/><br/>   - Mendel S.                        </div>
