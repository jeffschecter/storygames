The game seems to have some cool ideas that I would like to emulate. Particularly the idea behind (discussed at length <a href="http://therpghaven.com/viewtopic.php?p=447#p447" rel="nofollow">here</a>) the whole 'spend bennies - incur penalty - sacrifice benefits to pay off penalty' aspect regarding Aiki and Karma. The reason I like this idea is because it seems very good at representing wuxia melodrama that I wish to emulate for my own game: the hero comes to town, becomes attached to the locals in trying to settle down perhaps (attachments seem to generate more bennies) and spends those bennies defending town from predators incurring karma which, in order to mitigate losing your character to Karma, means cutting those ties you have formed. <br/><br/>Anywho, the idea I had is thus:<br/><br/>Hero does something important (not sure how to mechanically define that) and receives +1 Destiny point.<br/>Hero stores Destiny which, at certain levels, incrementally reduces XP costs for character development.<br/>GM can spend a hero's Destiny points to gain bonus dice in opposition. In so doing hero gets to replenish his Chi for fuelling his own powers etc (as you might expect).<br/>GM can spend Destiny also to force an Attachment onto a hero (maybe the princess you've saved has stolen your heart - or maybe your lucky sword). Attachments then become means to replenish Chi also, adding more ways to get power.<br/>Hero can spend Destiny to sacrifice Attachments (denying points to GM).<br/><br/>I don't want to completely copy the TBZ idea, not least of all because that's plagiarism, but also because Chi doesn't quite map to the way Aiki points work. Chi is a specific force, not easily represented by random 'luck points'. It's use doesn't necessite Karma either: in TBZ Karma is negative and leads to the PC becoming a demon (iirc - as I say I ain't never played it). That's not right either.<br/><br/>How to make this work without overly penalising the player or ceding to much control to teh GM - I'd rather the player had the choice to give dice to the GM in return for spending a point, but that would mean the player woudl want reasons not to have Destiny. It is not meant to be either negative or positive, but both...'interesting times'.

(And makes for better drama, too, if the hero overlooks the obvious local beauty and takes a liking to the milkman's daughter, or to the small stray dog, instead.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407660/#Comment_407660" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-01T00:41:38+00:00" title="March  1, 2013 12:41AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't; as I say the idea would be for heroes to choose how they proceed.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407760/#Comment_407760" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-01T20:00:36+00:00" title="March  1, 2013  8:00PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah.

The idea is, the players do awesome stuff to get bennies which they spend for bonuses, then the player hands the benny to the GM who can spend it to bolster the dangers and then the GM throws that benny back into the pool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408548/#Comment_408548" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-09T02:19:24+00:00" title="March  9, 2013  2:19AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sort of.
