You know the drill.]<br/><br/><b>Kingdom one-shot, Battleship Orion Starting Seed</b><br/><br/>Five players, four seasoned players of various trad and some indie RPGs, one newbie to RPGs in general.<br/><br/>First Minister Abel (power), civic leader<br/>Admiral Teese (power), military leader<br/>Dr. Sage (perspective), in charge of public health and safety<br/>Dr. Saito (perspective), math genius in charge of calculating FTL jumps<br/>"Stimmy" Martin (touchstone), bartender at the officer's lounge<br/><br/>We played through one crisis, whether or not to tell the public that the FTL engine core on the Orion is causing "space madness," with symtoms of headaches, dementia, and violent outbreaks. Ultimately the Admiral ousts the First Minister, sending him to the brig, but not before a pre-recorded warning message is broadcast, allowing him to become a Perspective. The Admiral institutes a military junta to make sure the public is not told about the source of the space madness, ensuring that the Orion's esential FTL capabilities will remain unscrutinised. But the people are not at all pleased with military rule, and the madness is spreading...<br/><br/>As with most GMless games, Kingdom is VERY accessible to new players, even those who have no experience with RPGs in general. Which is great! Writing good crossroads is somewhat difficult at first - I think a better one would have been "Will the kingdom disable the potentially-dangerous FTL drive?" or something to that effect, because in many cases our scenes drifted towards that question rather than the specific crossroad of "tell the public yes/no." I also found that at times we played it a bit too much like Fiasco, focusing on interpersonal relations rather than on the broader fate of the Kingdom, but I think that was just us adjusting to a new game. The tripartite role system is fascinating, and I look forward to playing more and exploring it further!<br/><br/>EDIT: Kingdom is a very, very effective Battlestar Galactica simulator, so I'm also curious to see how it fares with other kinds of genres and settings.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DorkThoughts" title="DorkThoughts"><img alt="DorkThoughts" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DorkThoughts">DorkThoughts</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419892/#Comment_419892" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-11T14:29:15+00:00" title="August 11, 2013  2:29PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2013 2:39PM by DorkThoughts.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Quiet Year, set near an old publishing warehouse(starting abandunce: how-to books) in a verdant deciduous forest amongst rolling hills.<br/><br/>Our community scouts reported a colossus that has appeared (seemingly having pulled itself out of the ground!) far to the southwest.

(He's Famous for his Pride, a game mechanic in the game where contrasting Traits are paired off... Merciful/Cruel, Modest/Proud and so on. Each pair totals 20, and if you have a value of 16 or higher in one of the Traits, you must roll that Trait in circumstances that might trigger it. So Gerin has a Pride of 16 and a Modest of 4.)<br/><br/>During a massive battle of many kinds and knights under Uther Pendragon, against the Saxons (who have been battling for the claim in Britain for generations), we see the ruler of the Saxons, King Octa, son of the Saxon King who murdered many British nobles and knights while under the protection of a peaceful summit. <br/><br/>Gerin and his companions (fellow Player Character knights, as well as his NPC brothers and other footmen) charge Octa and his bodyguards. The other Player Knights throw themselves at the bodyguard, distracting them as Gerin charges for Octa. He rains blows on the massive king with an all out attack, doing enough violence to knock the king from his horse and give him a mortal wound. He will die without help.<br/><br/>Gerin leaps off his horse, and with sword in hand, marches toward King Octa to finish him off. As his bodyguards fend off the other knights, Octa raises a hand to Gerin, begging for mercy and claiming his right to mercy as a fellow knight.<br/><br/>But Gerin has none of his, shouting at him for all the dead he and his people are responsible for. Gerin's companions, realizing what his about to happen, rush to King Octa's aid, putting themselves between Gerin and the Saxon King, for, indeed, it is a dishonorable thing Gerin is about to do.<br/><br/>Their efforts are for nought. Gerin swings his blade with his thick arms and snaps off the Saxon king's head at the neck. The body guards are in shock, as are Gerin's companions. But Gerin picks up that head as Uther approaches. "The Saxon King is dead!" Gerin cries.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Gerin and his companions then travel with Uther and his retinue as Uther Pendragon makes his King's Progress from one court to the next. At one of the dinner, Duke Gorlois arrives along with his wife, Ducheess Ygraine. Ygraine is the most beautiful woman in the kingdom, and will be so until Guinevere. Every man present must make a Lust roll to see if he is caught under the spell of her beauty. Gerin remains sober in this matter... and so gets to make an Awareness roll (he has a very natural Awareness in part because of his family trait, Keen Senses) and sees King Uther's face reveal he covets her to violent degree. <br/><br/>Now, during the battle, Gerin was so captivated by Uther's speech to the troops before the battle developed a Passion Love (Uther Pendragon), which is like Traits in that you can get bonuses for high values and you must act on them if they are high. Moreover, you can get bonuses if you invoke your Passion (but horrible things can happen if you botch your attempt to invoke a Passion.)<br/><br/>Gerin sees Uther lusting for the wife of one of his most powerful allies and knows that everything Uther has been working for can be undone if he does not reign in his desires. Having seen the Arch Druid Merlin at the battle (and having utter respect for him as a Pagan), Gerin seeks out Merlin in the hall. <br/><br/>Colin, our GM, is playing Merlin with twitching impatience of Nicol Williamson in the movie EXCALIBUR. Gerin, troubled and bashful in the face of the Arch Druid, tries to obliquely point out he has concerns of a noble man who might undo the good work of others by betraying those he needs loyal to him. But Merlin lashes out, "Oh, like a knight who dishonors himself by killing a KING begging for mercy! Oh, there's a man to judge another man. Yes, oh, yes, there's some behavior for you. Not this generation. I was wrong, this won't be the generation!"<br/><br/>Stung and realizing he has (appropriately) been called out, Gerin steps away, trying to get in a hot-headed comment to make himself feel better at Merlin's expense. But it doesn't work. He knows if he can't do his job right, then he can't expect Uther to do it either.<br/><br/>Now, all of us (the Players) have been waiting to tell the tale of our part of the big battle with Saxons a week earlier at the bid dinner feast. We're ready to do it. Gerin has King Octa's head in a sack as a prop. it's going to be awesome. And I say to our GM: "Gerin tells the tale with all the gust he can," and the other Player Knights join in.<br/><br/>"But," I say, "He's going to humble himself at the end. I'm trying to invoke modesty here. At the point where Gerin lifts the head out of the sack and everyone knows what's coming, he says, 'And here I did the wrong thing. For I did not act as a knight should act. For we have responsibilities that go beyond our own harsh desires. And for the peace of our land and each other, we need to respect them.'<br/><br/>"And at that moment," I narrate, I turn to look at Uther at the platform looking out over the hall, trying to catch his eye, and tell him to cool it with my allegorical mea culpa."<br/><br/>And Colin says, "So, you're trying to be Modest?" <br/><br/>And I say, "Yes."<br/><br/>"Make a roll against your Modest Trait."<br/><br/>Gerin's Modest Trait is only a 4. I roll a d20. I fail.<br/><br/>Colin says, "Make a roll against your Proud Trait. You're trying to do the right thing with this presentation of modesty. But let's see if you believe it." <br/><br/>I roll. I succeed at my Proud Trait check of a d20 against a value of 16... which means my character acts in accordance with my Pride.<br/><br/>Colin says, "As you hold the head high in your hand, knowing you killed the King of the Saxons, you know you're satisfied in all ways. And as you look at King Uther, he meets your gaze. He shares a look with you. 'Yes,' he seems to be saying, 'We have to say the words we have to say. But we are men, and we will do as we will do'" And the two of you share a subtle smile.<br/><br/>And in that moment, my Pride defeated me. And I was on a path, if I was not careful, to work with Uther to destroy the fragile peace he'd been working so hard to build.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>I love how KAP offers up much meat in the turns of what you think you want to do, but that your character, due to his Traits and Passions cannot do (or does, though you do not want him to) and your find yourself chasing after the fictional emotions of a character behaving not as you wanted him to, but as he is.<br/><br/>Later that night, on the drive home, I thought a lot about what role pride has been playing in my decisions and behavior of late.<br/><br/>I love this game so much.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420020/#Comment_420020" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-14T00:45:50+00:00" title="August 14, 2013 12:45AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Finished Kerberos Fate for now.

The rift in space-time was also causing the universe to slowly gain intelligence (a Paradox), which is never good.<br/><br/>Our bite begins on a pleasure planet, where the Guardian was enthralling vacationers with its Neuro Dampener.  Dr. Person (an alien professor with a PhD in Business Zoology and a minor in Useless Trivia -- which, of course, includes human first aid) decided to head to the planet and find out all he could about the threat.  He rolled a ton of successes, destroying the Guardian with some overkill.  Essentially, he found out <i>so much</i> about the Unstable Guardian that he was able to determine the precise momentum of it, causing it to disappear into quantum uncertainty.  Only the orb of the Dampener remained.<br/><br/>Awesome game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
