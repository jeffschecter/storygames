                    I recommend the Economist article about Nintendo's strategy, <a href="http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8080787" rel="nofollow">Playing a different game</a>.<br/><br/>It's got a lot of relevance to RPGs. Here's a sample:<br/><br/><i>Nintendo set out to reach beyond existing gamers and expand the market. This would involve simpler games that could be played for a few minutes at a time and would appeal to non-gamers or casual gamers (who play simple games on the web but would not dream of buying a console). They would be based on new, easy-to-use controls. And they would rely on real-life rather than escapist scenarios.</i><br/><br/>Graham                </div>

                            This is why the Wii is the first console I've wanted to try to buy at launch since... um... ever. Video games have gotten really deep and specific, so Sony's big racing game is Gran Turismo, which is made by and for car fanatics, and you can't, say, drive a Ferrari until you've completed enough races with Honda Civics and whatnot to buy one. Nintendo's big racing game is Mario Kart, where you pick between Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Bowser, etc. (And Microsoft has Project Gotham Racing and Forza Motorsport...). And the thing is, even people who are serious gamers are starting to have a hard time investing the kind of time a lot of the newer games demand. And granted its anecdotal, but I hear similar stories from tabletop gamers on RPG.net all the time lately: "I have a wife and kids, so I don't have time for to play D&amp;D every week for several years."<br/><br/>Nintendo's already making headway with the DS and stuff like Brain Age, and especially in Japan there's starting to be a lot of cartridges that either aren't games (electronic dictionaries, cookbooks, educational tools), or are games aimed at casual gamers and adults (Nintendogs, Brain Age). One of these days I need to hand my grandmother my DS with Brain Age running and see what happens.<br/><br/>The Wii seems less intimidating; instead of a controller that has twelve buttons and three directional things and looks like it came from outer space, you hand someone a sort of white TV remote, and tell them to just swing it like a tennis racket.<br/><br/><a href="http://lostgarden.com/2005/09/nintendos-genre-innovation-strategy.html" rel="nofollow">This article</a> has a lot to say about the potential for innovation that the Wii has, and about the genre lifecycle in video games.                        </div>

                            Neko,<br/><br/>I agree.  The learning curve is a major obstacle.  It's not just an issue of having to invest a hell of a lot of time to complete the game, it's also the fact that when you pick a new game up, you have to learn how to play it.  Now, if you've been playing games for years, then you've probably got an instinctive grasp of how things are going to work.  Personally, when I pick up a new game, I'm able to grasp the core mechanics without looking at the manual, because there are only so many buttons, and most games will follow certain patterns.  But if you haven't played games since the Atari, then a 360 controller represents a daunting challenge in and of itself.<br/><br/>It doesn't help that the control configuration for a game evolves from iteration to iteration.  While this additional complication is occasionally tied to evolving gameplay, it can also be the result of other forces.  For instance, if you're working on a new installment in a series of boxing games, you may be told to revise your configuration to match that of another (more successful) boxing game.<br/><br/>In pen-and-paper games, the learning curve is similarly challenging, particularly for new gamers.  Heck, I've been gaming for over twenty years, and I still find myself asking, now, am I supposed to roll dice every time the player does this, or is it only when the action is opposed?  Then I flip to page 40, and I read the rules, and I still don't know exactly.  So I make something up, and then I promptly forget what the work-around was.<br/><br/>I think that the solutions may well be similar in principle: in video games, the delivery of the control schema through contextualized gameplay; in p-n-p games, a simplified mechanism that focuses the user experience and that delivers a precise (and technical) delineation of said experience through rules and examples.  Though this probably isn't the right place to delve into either idea, I guess the point that I'm making is that the story game, or the indie game, or whatever, is more appropriate for our burgeoning market, in the same way that the new wave of casual games is appropriate for Nintendo's target audience.  My gaming group consists of novice gamers.  We've been gaming on and off for about five years, but we've only played a handful of game systems in that time, mostly my homebrew (D12), and some Paladin, and the Star Trek game published by Decipher (which lasted about one session).  If I had to start with another completely new gaming group, I'd do more of the same.  Except the Star Trek game, because that took an entire game session to go over the rules and create characters.  Same goes for newbie video gamers.  If I wanted to get their feet wet, I'd start with Donkey Konga (in fact, I have) or Wario Ware: Touched.<br/><br/>-- Rafael                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DanielSolis</cite>Is there a brand as versatile for different genres as the "Mario" brand?</blockquote>
That's a good question.  As far as video games are concerned, I think any brand will do.  So long as the context is properly integrated into the game genre, no reason it couldn't work.  James Bond games were first-person shooters at first.  Then, there was a racing game, then a third-person action game.<br/><br/>Sonic and Crash bandicoot have also crossed genre boundaries pretty successfully.  Same goes for the Resident Evil and LOTR games, come to think of it.<br/><br/>Mario's the most visible brand, but it's also one of the oldest (24 years).  I'd say that one serious impediment to cross-genre development is the risk of the unknown.  After all, if your studio's been cranking out racing games for five years, and the sales are good, why risk a sudden leap to two-player fighters?  The other issue is marketing.  By switching it up and suddenly delivering Silent Hill Racing, you run the risk of confusing an audience that associates the Silent Hill brand with third-person survival horror.<br/><br/>Another factor is the association of a brand with a console platform.  Note that the other two major players in the console wars are Microsoft and Sony, neither of which offers a mascot-protagonist-brand.  There's no analogue for Mario on the PS2 or Xbox, although there are powerful characters and games on both systems.  Mario stands for Nintendo, and is therefore a powerful selling point, and is often used to sell games that might not otherwise get too much exposure.  There's a big difference, in other words, between Nintendo Tennis and Mario Tennis, or Nintendo Golf and Mario Golf.  He's a very useful icon, and is tied to the console in a way that hasn't been attempted since, with the exception of Sega's Sonic.<br/><br/>Now, as far as pen-and-paper games are concerned, I fear that the notion of the brand may not translate very well.  But, for the sake of argument, I would say that any pen-and-paper brand, such as Dungeons and Dragons, could be molded into a series of genre-specific games.  Theoretically.  Like, I guess you could say that Spelljammer is an example of that.<br/><br/>-- Rafael                        </div>

                            Ewen, that was a <i>fantastic</i> article, thank you.<br/><br/>Daniel, I think we'll tie ourselves in knots if we try to pick out a Nintendo of RPGs. But we could say that White Wolf is a "genre king": a huge product, with a specialised fanbase, which is in danger of appealing <i>only</i> to that fanbase. And similarly D&amp;D.<br/><br/>I think the lesson to be learnt, from both articles, is that there's room for innovative, low-tech products against the Wizards of the Coast behemoths. Those low-tech things can be simple, fun games, not designed to appeal to the traditional fanbase, but to reach outside it.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

It's starting to look like Exalted could be pretty versatile. Of course, given drift, you could say every roleplaying setting ever made is extremely cross-genre, for the video gamer's sense of the word "genre."                        </div>

Well, "genre" means category.  In video game development, you've got categories of gameplay, such as first-person shooter, flight sim, strategy game, or fighter.  Then, you've also got settings, which include the Wild West, or the post-apocalyptic wasteland, or medieval Europe, or what-have-you.<br/><br/>So, I guess I'd ask, are you saying that you could take any game setting (like Ravenloft) and apply it to any category of p-n-p gaming?<br/><br/>-- Rafael                        </div>

True.  Of course, if you look at it that way, the World of Darkness has also inspired video games, a TV miniseries, soundtracks, numerous novels, and two movies in production.<br/><br/>Getting back to the original post, I think it is worth pointing out that many hardcore gamers look forward to playing games on the Wii out of a sense of nostalgia and loyalty.  It makes me wonder if the buzz surrounding the console stems not from the casual gamer anticipating a game system that he or she can finally get into, but instead hardcore gamers who still love Metroid and Zelda and Mario.  It doesn't hurt that the controller is unique and interesting, of course.<br/><br/>-- Rafael                        </div>
