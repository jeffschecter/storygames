There's no tension in the early game, it starts out as a routine operation.<br/><br/>Then another person gives the word its meaning by responding to it. And records how the word was used and what it now means. The response should also include a fact about the setting which leads into a new problem for the next player to talk about. Reincorporating a previously established word is also required in sentences in the second half of the game.<br/><br/>Eventually you populate the dictionary and establisth a setting through the conversation and activities of the crew of the ship.<br/><br/>Does a game like this already exist?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423240/#Comment_423240" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-21T05:46:02+00:00" title="October 21, 2013  5:46AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The iOS party game Space Team is very close to what you describe: <a href="http://www.sleepingbeastgames.com/spaceteam/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.sleepingbeastgames.com/spaceteam/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biffboff" title="biffboff"><img alt="biffboff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/189/nI5NYQDMCBCPG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biffboff">biffboff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423241/#Comment_423241" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-21T05:48:17+00:00" title="October 21, 2013  5:48AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 21, 2013 5:51AM by biffboff.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I could see something like this being a fun addition to "Video Scream" to create a parody of sci-fi dilemmas. As with many games, it would take the right group to pull it off entertainingly. Particularly, people adroit with tongue twisters or a difficult turn-of-phrase. <br/><br/>- "Bridge, the torqued-down spindle rollers are causing the sphincter valves to oscillate."<br/>- "Well, by-pass the main power couplings with the auxiliary capacitors."<br/>- "But - isn't Medical using the auxiliary capacitors to complete their Level 3 Berillion sweep of the ship?"<br/>- "Great Googily Moogily! You're right! We'll just have to invert the phase inducers and hope for the best."<br/><br/>I doubt I could pull it off for more than 10 minutes but I'd definitely watch others playing it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy" title="TotallyGuy"><img alt="TotallyGuy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy">TotallyGuy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423245/#Comment_423245" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-21T06:31:58+00:00" title="October 21, 2013  6:31AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This idea came from a game I played yesterday in which I thought, for a while, I was playing something like the above.  (Minus a list of words and recording them.)<br/><br/>But it turned out it was really a traditional RPG in which everybody but me knew the vocabulary and the capabilities that the terms all implied.<br/><br/>I hope nobody took the "Guy invented meaningless sci-fi words" incident to be malicious. <img alt=":p" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/tongue.png" title=":p"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423250/#Comment_423250" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-21T07:40:26+00:00" title="October 21, 2013  7:40AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The part about defining and reusing words reminds me of Lexicon.<br/><br/>(Also, your origin story is hilarious!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
