I'm wondering, though, about how feasible it would be (or how useful it has already been for others) to present actual rules and guidelines for "proper" in-game dialog for a given game. <br/><br/>Just for example: Let's say you want to set a game based in the world of Cormac McCarthy's <i>The Road.</i> If you've ever read that book, you know that it has a very distinctive style of dialog; no quotation marks, brief sentences, very little in the way of following or preceding dialog with things like "he said." Would you gain much by ruling that players should not make any explicit distinction between speaking in-character and out-of-character to try to preserve that tone? Or, alternatively, say you're doing a game in an over-the-top noir setting \u2013 can you imagine players being rewarded for speaking tersely in their dialog, but offering lengthy and detailed voice-overs to fill in all the gaps?<br/><br/>I suppose I'm thinking about this because there's a huge range in my own gaming groups in terms of how comfortable players are with the "improvisational acting" part of roleplaying and story gaming. I'm wondering if clearer guidelines, or even reward mechanisms, might in some cases help struggling players in "creating" dialog that fits appropriately in the setting, or even remove the responsibility to speak in-character at all (in a genre where dialog tends to be sparse anyway). In other words, I don't mean to suggest this as a way of clamping down on creative players who really get into their roles, but as a way to help out players who are more comfortable with character optimization than narration, but still want to participate in actual storytelling, you know?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419676/#Comment_419676" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-06T21:45:36+00:00" title="August  6, 2013  9:45PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/><i>My Daughter, the Queen of France</i> explicitly limits the use of dialogue in a variety of ways, which was in part intended to support players in building up their "improvisational acting" chops. For example, the first time you play a scene it is composed entirely of dialogue, without any description of character action. Character emotion is also explicitly forbidden. The goal was to imitate a certain sort of 'cold reading' of Shakespeare (or plays in general) that is most common in high school English classes, but it also means that the players generally have several chances to consider a scene, character motivation, etc. before they need to worry about conveying emotion through dialogue.<br/><br/>I think the most common ways that games encourage/support specific modes of dialogue is through modelling/example, usually in the game text and also sometimes the mechanics. <i>Polaris</i> would be probably the best example of this; not only does it have an extremely consistent, borderline-heavyhanded tone that is conveyed through the fictional excerpts (which you are explicitly instructed to read aloud, etc.) in the book, but more importantly the ritual phrases themselves place focus on dialogue and word-choice and support players in their attempts to render a specific sort of verbal style. I think the almost over-the-top flowery style of parts of the book are also important: it encourages players to go all-out in a way that a more reserved or subtle style would not.<br/><br/><i>Apocalypse World</i> also falls in this category; though it lacks the same tonal support in terms of ritual phrases, the extensive use of lists and the extremely evocative prose (in move names, etc.) helps model and encourage a certain type of in-game dialogue.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Noir is a good test-case, I think, but I haven't played a lot of noir-inspired games. There was a game at Gamestorm this year (whose name I am blanking on, sorry Morgan!) where one of the players plays the Detective's hat, and the hat only ever speaks in voice-over. In addition, many of the mechanics of the game limit both which characters can speak at what time, and what sort of things the characters/players can say. So while the game does not support specific styles of dialogue directly, it does place direct focus on dialogue by subjecting it to such rigorous mechanics. When there are rules that stop you from speaking, or force you to say specific sorts of things at specific times, that naturally creates a focus on the dialogue that is produced. I think that this approach, in combination with players who are familiar with the genre/style in question, is extremely fruitful. It's much harder when there isn't a genre touchstone to draw on, of course, but it sounds like that might be outside of the scope anyways.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419680/#Comment_419680" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-07T00:08:22+00:00" title="August  7, 2013 12:08AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, games that come to mind with actual rules for in-character dialogue: <br/><br/>(1) Land of Og, by Aldo Ghiozzi.   This is a comedic game of cartoon cavemen, where one the character traits is the list of words you can say - like "you", "me", "fire", "bang", and "go".  <br/><br/>(2) Puppetland, by John Tynes - One of the rules of this is that everything said at the table is in-character.  (You can speak out of character by getting up out of your seat.)  In keeping with puppet show tradition, the usual way to narrate is by having your character speak out what they are doing, like "I hit you with my knobby club, you nasty alligator.  Take that!"  This doesn't strongly affect dialogue per se, but it affects in-character speech a lot.  <br/><br/>(3) A Thousand and One Nights, by Meguey Baker -  The stories told between the courtier characters are in some ways narrated action, but they are also in-character dialogue.  Some groups just focus on the stories told, but in my favorite games, the stories really are dialogue and interaction between the characters.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419682/#Comment_419682" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-07T00:31:10+00:00" title="August  7, 2013 12:31AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 7, 2013 5:56AM by Rickard.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Dogs</b> and <b>Psychodrame</b> are two games that I can think of.

Perhaps you can do it with clearer guidelines, but to make people want to improvise a conversation, they need to feel free from blockage and having some self-confidence. There are tons of theater exercises that you can do, and probably incorporate them into structures for  roleplaying games. Read something about creative drama or written by Viola Spolin, where both are using improv exercises in their work.

It is so easy as a player to get hung up on saying exactly the wittiest or most cutting or most flirty/sexy thing, or to struggle to live up to the manner-of-speech you imagine for your character. Reminding players that they can just <i>narrate</i> their dialogue is a huge deal, and the ability to freely mix the two modes is IMO ideal, since it allows you to convey the character you want while still inserting bits and pieces of actual first-person dialogue <i>when it happens to come easily to mind</i>.<br/><br/>I'd be interested in hearing about any games (besides Puppetland, already mentioned) that make explicit use of the first/third person division, or otherwise train players in their use. Delve's pacing mechanic comes to mind, though it's a bit more indirect.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419690/#Comment_419690" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-07T07:06:36+00:00" title="August  7, 2013  7:06AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 7, 2013 7:07AM by Rickard.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            During a thought experiment I made a <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?678118-A-combat-system-with-a-nice-flow" rel="nofollow">conflict system</a> that structured the dialogue between the players and the game master (be sure to also read my first three answers in the thread).

Take that!") than in terms of the tone of the actual story itself (especially as that kind of theater sometimes touches upon some pretty heavy and/or disturbing ideas). I'm mostly concerned with approaches to dialog my players are likely to feel comfortable delivering; I imagine that'll be tied into genre/setting expectations, but perhaps it doesn't have to be.\n<blockquote>Games like The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen also come to mind: not only for the explicit directions (like ritual phrases, drinking wine, the way to phrase wagers and questions, etc) but also for the really strong feel of the dialogue and written style which the players are all encouraged to emulate as they play (kind of like in Polaris, I'd say).</blockquote>\nIndeed! Baron Munchausen was actually the exact game I was thinking of when I mentioned games that "<i>implicitly</i> encourage speaking a certain way." I've played it a few times with somewhat overlapping groups of friends, and even though nobody is ever told, "Dear Baron, please be sure to use proper diction....", everybody seems to get right off the bat how they are expected to deliver their stories. Of course, that game is ALL dialog, in a sense, so perhaps it's easier to know what's expected of you than a game that sees players swapping back and forth between out-of-character narration and in-character speech.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419740/#Comment_419740" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-07T13:20:17+00:00" title="August  7, 2013  1:20PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Primitive</b> by Kevin Allen doesn't let you talk at all, I believe.

For example, it is customary to turn down a gift twice so that the giver may show sincerity by offering it a third time. To not do this leads an automatic failure on any etiquette roll. Similarly, the restriction on transactions to gift giving and not bartering really sets the mood of the game, and is represented by an honor mechanic.<br/><br/>An example of an implicit rule is how the warrior monks of the Togashi family must speak in riddles. This is not covered by rules, so there is no way to enforce it.<br/><br/>Certain people don't have to follow any rules when they speak. That's because they are tainted (by the Shadowlands, or demons, or a variety of other things).

I remember a Shadowrun game where we contacted the spirit of an elevator, who could only speak in terms of up/down and go/stop.  Air elementals in fantasy homebrews could only speak in terms of wind, moisture, temperature and pressure.  I think this is a combination of two premises:<br/>1) you can only say what your character could say, based on their knowledge and perspective<br/>2) their knowledge and perspective is really friggin' weird<br/><br/>I've also played in noir games where every player was encouraged to talk like an archetypal noir character (so, a lot of Bogart), action parodies where a high stat means you must talk like Vin Diesel, supervillain games that give you points for talking like a classic Marvel villain, etc.<br/><br/>In <i>Burning Wheel</i> Duel of Wits, you might script a conversational move like "Obfuscate" because it's mechanically advantageous.  When it comes time to roleplay out your plan, you then have to speak (or otherwise narrate, but usually in-character) in a way that serves to obfuscate, even if that isn't what comes naturally for you when you normally speak in-character.<br/><br/>Some horror games advice the GM to use slow, quiet speech to put players on edge, and then loud, fast speech to startle them when introducing danger.  (This isn't actually about in-character speech at all, just a dialogue technique, but this thread seems to be including those.

To avoid paradox, whatever they say to you at that moment is something you need to remember to tell yourself when you're in their shoes later in the game. Zany.<br/><br/>It's interesting how the different approaches to rules governing dialogue can go either way in terms of how much is expected of players. I was originally thinking of this in terms of, "How might I make this easier on players who have a tough time speaking in character?" I suspect that several of the games that bother to explicitly address dialogue, however, would actually provide an added challenge. I wonder whether that would be more likely to serve more like a crash course, forcing players to think about this more and helping get them used to playing in-character, or whether it would just become an annoyance to players who are less interested in this aspect of roleplaying and storytelling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419795/#Comment_419795" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-08T09:31:48+00:00" title="August  8, 2013  9:31AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.photographsoflightning.com/silver-and-white/" rel="nofollow">Silver and white</a> is a game in development over here.<br/><br/>I was lucky to play test and found its,,<b>learn as you play</b> approach refreshing change. <br/>Narration rules gave players control of certain parts of the world, and if I remember correctly touching someone could result in swapping epilogue cards? <a href="http://wilper.wordpress.com/2011/12/08/reading-silver-and-white-by-jackson-tegu/" rel="nofollow">More detailed link here</a>.<br/><br/>I hope it becomes available again or is completed for sale.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419813/#Comment_419813" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-08T15:15:54+00:00" title="August  8, 2013  3:15PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2013 3:18PM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I was originally thinking of this in terms of, "How might I make this easier on players who have a tough time speaking in character?"

When you described how your group would find it challenging to have a scene entirely in dialogue form (as I described happening in MDtQoF), my reaction was 'well exactly.' It's meant to be difficult. (Both the whole game is meant to be difficult, but also that specific restriction is meant to be difficult within the context of the game's dynamic.)<br/><br/>But also, you mostly get better at things by doing them. If your group compulsively avoids first- or even third-person dialogue, then they're unlikely to ever feel more comfortable speaking in-character, because they will never have the opportunity to practice. A game can support practice in a few ways, but one of those is just 'not giving you an option not to do it' (I mean obviously within the context of the game, rather than the larger social contract.) AW helps people become better GMs by refusing to let them off the hook for principled actions, for example; it says 'this is how you play, these are rules' and so encourages MCs to be more self-conscious and directed about how they run the game. This is true even though most of the things the rules tell you to do are things you probably already want to do, or are already trying to do.<br/><br/>Of course games can also help by providing guidelines on how to speak in-character, and also encourage practice by providing lots of opportunities to do so. Ideally those opportunities are somehow set up in the players' favour, so that the very act of speaking in-character is likely to be dramatically effective even if their dialogue choices are just ok. Genres that call for dramatic monologues of various sorts can be good at this, even though they also put a lot of pressure on the player. Games that restrict speech in challenging/entertaining ways are also good at this, because 'speak only in emotional monotone' or 'use only this limited caveman vocabulary' are just kind of funny ways of talking, all on their own.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419816/#Comment_419816" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-08T18:23:02+00:00" title="August  8, 2013  6:23PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another technique that occurs to me is stuff like Primetime Adventures, Death School, or Fate, which gives you some "quotes", or notable sayings which you can use during certain phases of the game.

They're there much to control what you say and how you say it when narrating, but since the rules apply to dialog as well, it influences how people talk in character.<br/><br/>The first such rule has no in-character consequences. It states that everything that has been narrated is true, so you cannot contradict another player. Of course, characters can contradict each other, so this rule doesn't affect character dialog.<br/><br/>The second one says that you cannot interrupt another player. You have to wait for them to finish speaking. This also influences dialog in that people can get away with longer, more ornate speech. They won't be interrupted in the middle of making a grand statement. It also contributes to the "epic fairy tale" style of the game.<br/><br/>The third rule is that there are no names in the world (called, appropriately, <i>Le monde sans nom</i>, "The world without a name"), and no names can be created. This means that instead of calling someone by name, you say something like "my golden-haired friend" or "the city across the mountains where the rivers smell of flowers", "the king with a heart of stone" or somesuch. You describe things, both in narration and in dialog.

If I had to get more specific, though, I'd have to admit that it's more than one issue, and more than one kind of player. Everything noted in your examples above has come up at one point or another. I've already had someone come to me about spotlight management issues (so I'm more careful now when GMing to check in with quieter players more often). I've also played with people who seem to have a tough time acting, but then when they try to make things easier by typecasting themselves, other players give them crap for playing the same cliched characters over and over. <br/><br/>I think part of the issue at our table shared even by different players, though, is that when one or two people set them tone for "this is how dialogue goes," then others feel like they need to follow suit (and that can sometimes leave you feeling like, "Man, that's a tough act to follow"). In other words, in the absence of a rule dictating how (or whether) you handle dialogue, the less confident players will look to the more confident players to demonstrate how it's done. When I put it that way, though, it occurs to me that my own group's issue may be better resolved through an open discussion of <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18646/techniques-do-we-have-a-list-of-them" rel="nofollow">techniques</a> than an actual rule governing dialogue.<br/><br/>* * *<br/><br/>All of that said, there is another side to this issue that I was thinking of when I started this thread: Not just how to help players having trouble, but whether it's a problem when I don't perceive in-character dialogue as actually contributing to the story we're telling. <br/><br/>For example: I was playing in a fantasy game with some friends the other night, and we needed a certain item from a PC's brother (who was an NPC). The player goes and strikes up a conversation in-character. They chat for a while about things that we as players already all know, so there's not a lot to actually reveal here, but it goes on for kind of an uncomfortably long time, with three of us just sitting around while this guy shoots the shit with the GM. Finally, the player looks at the rest of us, like, "Okay ... so ... what next?" and somebody reminds him, "You still have to ask him for the thing we need." <br/><br/>So, we all have a good laugh, but I'm left wondering: Could we, should we have run that differently? It certainly would've been more economical to simply say, out of character, "I go to my brother, exchange some pleasantries, and ask him to part with this item." But would have have been <i>better</i>? I mean, just as a fight scene can be boring if you don't give any more description than, "I hit him," a conversation scene might be boring if there's no actual dialogue spoken. But then again, there's the question of whether all conversations need to be <i>scenes</i> of their own \u2013 can't some of the basic details that just need to be established to move the story forward simply happen "off-camera"? <br/><br/>Perhaps that's an issue of story pacing and scene focus more so than dialogue, but it's an issue (at least for my group) that seems uniquely related to the way a game implicitly handles conversation. If you expect that all conversation should be handled through in-game dialogue, then you're going to have a lot of pointless conversations. If you decide that not all conversation should be handled through in-game dialogue, then how do you \u2013\xa0as a GM, as a player, or as a game designer actually adjudicating this \u2013\xa0decide what makes the cut, and what doesn't?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419860/#Comment_419860" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-09T22:09:03+00:00" title="August  9, 2013 10:09PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2013 10:10PM by Paul_T.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If you decide that not all conversation should be handled through in-game dialogue, then how do you \u2013\xa0as a GM, as a player, or as a game designer actually adjudicating this \u2013\xa0decide what makes the cut, and what doesn't?</blockquote>\nI think the basic idea here is that not everything should appear "on-screen". It's not so much about whether things are handled through in-character dialogue; it's more about "what do we care enough to spend time playing through, and what do we prefer to skip over?"<br/><br/>There's no magic answer to this question, since each game and each group will find a different balance. In practice, I find one useful technique is to think about this before entering any scene: "Do I have something important to do here? Is what we're about to play through something which needs to be appear in the story?" If you do not, ask the other players if <i>they</i> do. "Hey, do you want to actually play this through? Because all I need to do is grab this item from my brother: I don't have anything particularly interesting to do or say here." If they <i>also</i> have nothing to say, then skip that scene altogether, or summarize it quickly if necessary.<br/><br/>A good story needs an editor: don't forget that when you're playing, and edit ruthlessly as you go along. Not all scenes make it into the final cut of a movie. Ask each other, as a group, at each step of the way, "Why do we care about this particular moment?"<br/><br/>Maybe it's because there's an important challenge, or a question to be answered. Maybe you're both really enjoying just playing out the dialogue - that's a worthy answer too. Maybe it's a pivotal moment where a character's decision is really important. There are many possible answers to that question. But if you don't have one at all... press the "fast forward" button. Your games will be better for it.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419862/#Comment_419862" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-09T23:10:59+00:00" title="August  9, 2013 11:10PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2013 11:16PM by David_Berg.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, if you agree with Paul, here's <a href="http://www.shrikedesign.com/games/delve/pacing.html" rel="nofollow">a tool I use for that</a>.  Putting this "pacing dial" on the table is basically a reminder to think about the stuff Paul mentioned, and a way to quickly communicate desired adjustments.<br/><br/>As for what to do when the group does want to play out some dialogue, but some people get caught up in it and lose track of a goal, and other people start getting bored...  I think it really depends on your priorities.  If <i>getting caught up in imagination</i> is more important, then the roleplay should continue, and everyone should be looking for ways to get the bored people into it, especially the bored people themselves.  If <i>making progress</i> is more important, then everyone should be looking for ways to help get the conversation back on track.  If both priorities are equal, then maybe a bit of each.  If you'd already thought all that stuff through, then sorry for the ramble; just wanted to cover those bases.<br/><br/>If you have rules for determining "so what do we get out of this conversation?" on hand, you can reduce the complexity of this situation to "when do we employ the rule?"  If it's a die roll, then the bored people can say "sounds like time to roll!" instead of something unproductive.  If you like that route, I know many games with rules for social resolution, but none that actually tell you how to do the "talking in character" portion of that.<br/><br/>I felt like I should mention that, but I hope you reject it.  "Use social mechanics" is old news.  Actually helping players with their dialoguing is way more exciting!

I wonder how that would be received coming from a fellow player rather from the guy running the game (at least in my group).<br/><br/>I am starting to think that maybe we just need to play more of a variety of games so my group doesn't just approach every single game the same way. From what I've peeked at so far, Polaris seems like a great game to get us thinking very purposefully about narration and dialog. We'll see, though. Running some unusual stuff with them has sparked some interesting conversations lately, but hasn't yet convinced anyone that "the way we've always played D&amp;D" isn't necessarily <i>the absolute best way ever.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420075/#Comment_420075" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-14T19:20:15+00:00" title="August 14, 2013  7:20PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For what it's worth, that's a common reaction.
