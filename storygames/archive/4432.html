I'm wondering who's played it recently (or is going to), and if people have developed more and/or better ways of handling things in-game. Personally, I've found that it runs great as a convention game, and I can get a great deal out of it in as little as four hours. In fact, I'll be running it again at the Endgame Oakland October minicon.<br/><br/>So, how have people refined their play of TMW? Tell me your secrets and I'll tell you mine! ;-)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100074/#Comment_100074" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-30T23:34:11+00:00" title="September 30, 2007 11:34PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Argh!

It's deep and deceptively simple. I haven't played it in a year now, but definitely want to do it again. It has only grown more intense each time I've tried it. The sessions last autumn were great, but I can still see it grow even stronger. I too want to try it with 5+ players next time. (I've played it with 6, 4, 3 and 3).<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I've done (or tried to do) is to reverse the roles the closer to the castle the ronin get. The first encounters/bangs/fights/situations I usually have monsters show up, or what looks like unsympathetic characters (perhaps masking as sympathetic). Then, the farther the get I have them meet with more human and complex npc's. By this time they might, depending on how they've acted toward their companions and others, really start to questions their motives. Or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething I'll try to do next time I play is to use wounds against the pc's more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100092/#Comment_100092" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-01T03:54:31+00:00" title="October  1, 2007  3:54AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll be starting a game of it for my group this coming Wednesday.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100107/#Comment_100107" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-01T05:22:25+00:00" title="October  1, 2007  5:22AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 1, 2007 5:57AM by timfire.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi y'all,<br><br>There's a printing of tMW (&amp; Kwaidan) in the works, it should be available... within the month, I think.

The GM is free to create challenges and such so the proceedings are different each time.  It's like the dungeon in D&amp;D.  Yeah you've done 50 dungeons before . . . but this one's got a different layout, different monsters, and new, exciting challenges to explore. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then there are the dark fates, which REALLY mix things up.  Even two games of MW with roughly the same challenges would play out very differently based on what fates people drew and how they decided to play them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, and this is probably the biggest point:  The game isn't about killing the Mountain Witch . . . it's about the characters who are trying to kill him and their agendas, trials, and ability to relate to each other.  In other words, the thing about the game that SEEMS repetitive (some dudes with swords, uh, climb a mountain) isn't ultimately what the focus of the game is.  It's bound to be different every time based on who those dudes are and what they do with their swords.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100411/#Comment_100411" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T07:37:15+00:00" title="October  2, 2007  7:37AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Clint,<br/><br/>Well said.

And by the end of Act 3, everyone's Trust was plummeting. Ichiro, the most trusted ronin, had just cut a deal with the Kings of the Dead - he would protect O-Yanma in exchange for resurrecting his master.<br/>\n<br/>\nAct 4 was a single scene in O-Yanma's throne room.<br/>\n<br/>\nKiyo fell into hell when O-Yanma perished.<br/>\n<br/>\nIchiro failed to protect O-Yanma, and his master was sucked back into the Land of the Dead. That pissed Ichiro off. He attacked the ronin responsible for the kill (Hiroshi), rolled a tie, declared an ai-uchi, and elected to take them both out ...<br/>\n<br/>\n... which was ironic, because after 300 years Hiroshi had finally just managed to return to his original body (he'd been body-hopping for centuries), only to be decapitated.<br/>\n<br/>\nYuki looked at the dead bodies for a moment, grabbed the amulet of the Mountain Witch and walked off to claim his reward.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich left Goro, driven mad by carrying the ghosts of all his ancestors on his shoulders, and the betrayal of his true love, Sakura. He charged into Yuki-Onna's storm at the far end of the throne room to rescue Sakura, and disappeared from view.<br/>\n<br/>\nCue four out of the five epilogues taking place in the afterlife.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe players really seized hold of their Dark Fate narration this episode. Conflicts went smooth and fast. There was a bit of debate about the Betrayal mechanic, which got pulled out for the first time.<br/>\n<br/>\nA fun exciting time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100754/#Comment_100754" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-03T09:58:09+00:00" title="October  3, 2007  9:58AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 3, 2007 9:58AM by Eric.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Storygames Boston starts a new run of TMW tonight.

But here are some quick tips:<br><br>1. Spend some time getting to know everyone at the table, what they expect from the game, what they know about it and what they're bringing to it.<br><br>2. Tell everyone straight out "By the end of this, some or all of your characters will probably be dead, very likely by each others' hands." Explain how the game is designed to bring tensions between characters to a boiling point. Be sure everyone is totally cool with this. Tell them, the Witch is like the suitcase in Pulp Fiction, or the heist in Resevoir Dogs - resolution by killing the Witch is less important than what happens between the characters.<br/><br/>3. Tell everyone about how the game is designed for a slow burn, but for this session, you're going to drop the hammer and bust the quarter mile in no time flat, and therefore, every player has got to step up and take their characters' fates in their hands. If the players aren't pushing their Dark Fates and associated agendas at every opportunity, they won't have as much fun. Players <i>must</i> engage in order to make it work. Be sure to stress the importance of player involvement. Tell them your job as the GM isn't to stop the characters from getting up to the top of the mountain, it's to make them want to kill each other when they get there!<br/><br/>4. <i>Require</i> players to foreshadow their Dark Fates at least once, if not twice or more, during every chapter. "OK, before we start, I want a foreshadowing scene from everyone." "Does anyone want to take this opportunity to foreshadow?" "Jimmy, you're up, give us a foreshadowing scene." Push, push, push. There is <i>no</i> time to be coy about the Dark Fates in a 4 hour con slot. If a player hasn't pretty much revealed their character's Dark Fate by the end or middle of Chapter 3 (or earlier), you should ask the player to give you a scene that if it does not totally reveal the Dark Fate, it nearly does.<br/><br/>5. Start with a bang, tailored to a specific character if possible. Or start with a general event that makes everyone engage the rules and begin evaluating Trust immediately. A bakemono or oni attack is good.<br/><br/>6. Nobody rides for free. If someone is not doing anything, start pressing his or her character's buttons.<br/><br/>7. Keep an eye on the clock and move when you have to. I shoot for 4 chapters with about one chapter every 30 to 45 minutes - 1. Getting through the haunted forest to the base of Fuji-san; 2. Ascending the mountain; 3. Infiltrating the castle; 4. Final confrontation with the Witch. <br/><br/>8. Constantly remind players of their Trust options in conflicts - aid, betray, and buy narration.<br/><br/>9. Be prepared. Even if you don't make notes, be prepared to keep them - you need to know how to target bangs at the characters for one thing. <br/><br/>10. Be enthusiastic! Keep the pace up! If nothing is happening, make something happen, now! Keep reminding players of their Trust options, their responsibility to push the Dark Fates, and encourage them to engage their characters and each other at every opportunity!<br/><br/>Good luck!                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101130/#Comment_101130" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-04T14:13:09+00:00" title="October  4, 2007  2:13PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, I think I speak for everyone, feel free to share your Bangs here, or well, I'm interested, so whisper them to me? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Here's a question, to Tim and others, about a bit I found problematic while reading the game, I'll quote from another thread where I mentioned it.\n<blockquote>The section on Abilities is a bit vague.
