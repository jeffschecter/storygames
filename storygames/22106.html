That doesn't mean that stuff doesn't happen, but it does mean that as a community there's a genuine commitment to creating that kind of space. It also has a high proportion of queer and female participants, and some prominent people of color in the leadership.<br/><br/>The Gauntlet basically does two kinds of games: OSR, and Indie. There's never been any D&amp;D on it; it's a kind of quirk of the community. There's not a lot of play of stuff in the square trad space, or hybrids like Fate. A lot of the OSR gaming gets done via lighter, more indie engines, like World of Dungeons or Into the Odd. There's also a fairly healthy amount of OSR design stuff--my friend Richard wrote a terrific OSR take on a post-apocalyptic Oz where you lived beneath the fallen Emerald City.<br/><br/>Indie games run the gamut from PbtA to just about anything that can conceivably be played online. It tends to lean heavily into PbtA since one of the rules of running games there is you have to keep an open table and if people RSVP they get to play (there's a limited number of slots, of course), so PbtA tends to facilitate that easily. I know that when I put up Monsterhearts games they literally fill within five minutes.<br/><br/>In terms of design the concerns tend to be more practical than theoretical and concentrate on the actual design of games. There's several really decent games that have come out of the community: Fraser Simmons "The Veil" for example; more recently, the wuxia PbtA "Hearts of Wulin" and a twisty dark little descendent of Cthulhu Dark called "Trophy" about treasure hunters making an "incursion" into a forest that doesn't want them there. (I haven't gotten to play it, but I've heard good things.) All three of my games got playtested on the Gauntlet and they published one of them in their monthly magazine, Codex--which I highly recommend, it's really good. (I think the issue my game is in--Glamour--is currently PWYW on DriveThru.) I have an upcoming article on how to use "Good Society" to play Tolstoy's "War and Peace" and the Codex Volume One kickstarter will have a digital article about my Kingsport setting.<br/><br/>The forums have been a pretty lively place with some good discussion of stuff, I think, so they're definitely a place to think about spending some time with; also, a lot of the people there are just really cool and fun to talk to/play with--my online games have definitely been improved by getting to play with some people multiple times, like the two members of what I call the Kingsport Drama Society (because of their awesomely emotional play in my Kingsport games, and others). It's also a great place to pick up some online play, if you want to; for that it helps to contribute to the patreon because at the $8 level you get first crack at signing up. That said, quite a few games (I think over 50%) eventually take someone from the waitlist, so it's possible to get into games even at the lower level.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484608/#Comment_484608" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-29T16:04:24+00:00" title="May 29, 2019  4:04PM">May 29</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>  I don't think there's any barrier to bringing more theory discussion, so long as it is accessible (defining terms, assuming no knowledge of other forum discussion).

But if you'd like some bona fides, (1) I am an anarchist, and thus a leftist; (2) I was an organizer for OCCUPY, during which some of my proudest work came from forging communication and cooperation between groups of differing political views (including a cooperative march with a local chapter of the Tea Party); (3) while I appreciate the OSR and built Venger Satanis' website, I don't play OSR games personally, nor do I have much truck with its afficionados (FWIW, I also built Ron Edwards' current site).  But ultimately (4): I'm about game design and theory.  That's it.  As far as design tenets go, I view the <i>entire</i> toolbox, I don't divide it into two opposed sides.  I've designed super-crunchy "trad" games like <i>CyberSpace,</i> super-lite "modern" games like <i>Pocket Things,</i> and hybrid games like <i>DayTrippers.</i>  I have no interest in talking politics online, except inasmuch as it may pertain to design theory and diegesis, and I'd be willing to establish some guidelines strongly suggesting that such conversations be taken elsewhere.

There are hundreds of sites to discuss politics and one can find RPG sites that are very friendly to whatever one\u2019s politics. Story Game Forum discussions have been able to stay focused on the games because they limit the subject matter to the games themselves. It would be extremely easy to let our political views divide us and have the community end. Alternatively, we could come together and continue to discuss our shared interests in games, and continue to enjoy and learn from each other.

SG is certainly diving deeper into theory and maybe a  broader range of topics. There is a slight PbtA bias (so far) on Gauntlet. Also more US contributors (so far).<br/>While SG discussions mostly steer away from political opinions, there is a certain position shining through contributions in the Gauntlet forum. People are considerate and nice. I just would prefer to keep social/political opinions or positions out of game design discussions. That's my personal preference.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484719/#Comment_484719" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-30T19:14:33+00:00" title="May 30, 2019  7:14PM">May 30</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting, thanks!<br/><br/>I'm finding lots of really fantastic "practical" discussion of gaming with a very self-aware perspective.

In fact, I've always been jealous of theatre, and cosplay for the diversity of their spaces compared to many of my interests.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the culture seems to be concerned with "identity" to the detriment of other topics. People write games about "being a virgin", "being a bear", or "being a werewolf". While this is clearly an important component to roleplay, and a departure from mere escapism, I think that games can be much more than this. Games can be used to pose and frame difficult questions, to question institutions, and bring to light some of the real achievements in art and literature.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484756/#Comment_484756" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-31T06:07:03+00:00" title="May 31, 2019  6:07AM">May 31</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/EricJ" rel="nofollow">EricJ</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Games can be used to pose and frame difficult questions, to question institutions, and bring to light some of the real achievements in art and literature. </p></div></blockquote>\nMaybe this is sorta a Maslow's thing.

At the same time, I think the field is vastly richer than identity. It's possible to invoke ideology, history, culture. We can <br/>talk about psychology, personal growth, and the displacement of one identity for another (champion boxer to father). \n<blockquote>Games about identity and games about larger issues aren't mutually exclusive. In fact, focus on identity is important in the discussion of a lot of issues. <br/></blockquote>\nWell of course. My point is that it's possible to become mired in that limited facet.\n<blockquote>It\u2019s also very much worth noting that any game where the player plays a character can be boiled down to being about identity. DnD is about being a fantasy adventurer. Apocalypse World is about being a sexy badass in a post-apocalyptic world. etc, etc, etc.<br/>Playing a character is a very identity-focused activity. A lot of games and players just don\u2019t word it that, whereas the Gauntlet typically does.</blockquote>\nEven when you're playing a character in an RPG, there are hopefully other concerns than just mere identity. The examples you cite here are invoking the view that roleplaying is a vehicle for adolescent escapism. While there will always be elements of that, I would prefer there to some elements beyond that.<br/><br/>We can talk about how focused on identity the gauntlet is, but it is certainly possible to become mired in identity.
