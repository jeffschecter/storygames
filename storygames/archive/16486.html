And I used to love to LARP! Vampire, primarily, it was my gateway drug. But I've done a lot of home brews over the years (the Nobilis LARP that Jessica Hammer ran at Origins that one year numbering among my top favs). I've always wanted to branch out and try other types of LARP.  I love costuming, I love roleplaying, I love getting together with a bunch of cool people who love the things I love...<br/><br/>Who's doin it in the US? Where's the hot shit goin down that I'm missing out on? I'm not talking SCA or Dragoncon, Renn Faire or Anime cons, Camarilla or Steampunk picnics. I'm talkin full on elf ears battle in the forests fucking amazing LARPS with beautiful handmade armor, enthusiastic gamers who aren't ashamed to donn giant wings, a game that you play without boffer weapons, Victoriana in the parlor dress up in your favorite corset games... does this exist only in my mind? <br/><br/>I suppose I could also be talking about indie LARP groups: ie Shelter in Place, the Dance and the Dawn (if it ever comes out). My fantasy is trending toward the epic, though.<br/><br/>TELL ME.

Some amazing shit going on there.<br/><br/>It was originally a reaction against the "big Daddy" (or "D&amp;D") of the boffer scene, NERO. The main thing that Accelerant got rid of was the ridiculous rules where you have to say something *every freakin' time you swing your sword.* Called strikes are special abilities, and since everyone isn't shouting at once, it's much easier to hear what's going on, most of the time. Anything else hits you, assume it's just 1 damage. (I did try a NERO style game once and... never again. It's a terribly unfun way to fight.)<br/><br/>(The "flagship" game of the Accelerant family is Madrigal, which is still running.)<br/><br/>There is also a cultural expectation of never breaking character. (NPCs don't have this restriction, but are supposed to stay in character when "on screen" with the PCs.) Let me just say that maintaining your character for an entire weekend is really hard but rewarding.<br/><br/>But the other big strength the Accelerant games have going for them, in addition to ease of play, is flexibility and flavor. Numerous different games have used the Accelerant core rules, and not just for high fantasy\u2014there has been or soon will be Roman, Steampunk, post-apocalyptic sci-fi / science fantasy, swashbuckling, and lots of other things besides. Actually there are so many games running in this family that one of the biggest problems right now is there aren't enough weekends to accommodate them all\u2014this past weekend there were two games running over each other, and each drained a portion of the other's player base and staff.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377369/#Comment_377369" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-09T15:25:08+00:00" title="May  9, 2012  3:25PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2012 3:25PM by Evan_Torner.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Wyrdcon and Intercon, apparently.</blockquote>\nI second this, especially if what you're looking for are 2-6 hour one-shot events.

They came over to run the next weekend-long larp, Tombstone.<br/><br/>I trust them to run good larps. At Intercon K, they ran a horde larp (where most people play a variety of roles, and a few play the same role throughout the entire game) called "Victoria Station: All Change, Please Change", which had a lovely build over two hours from sort of keeping a lid on chaos to shooting elephants in the flowerbeds. I've never played in the larps they ran with a Firefly setting, as those fill in negative time, aka a New York Minute.<br/><br/>The team of Paranoid-and-Crochety run larps for which I will turn my Intercon schedule upside down to be a part of.

In our case, we found a venue with mutliple spaces, then recruited GMs to run about 15 games, including a "flagship" event which would provide the centrepiece for the con.  Some of the games were written specially, some of them were reruns of games run elsewhere in NZ (we have a pretty good theatre-style community here), and some were downloaded from the internet (courtesy of this list <a href="http://wiki.rpg.net/index.php/LARP_Scenarios" rel="nofollow">here</a>).  After that, it was just marketing and logistics.<br/><br/>Running a con is a fairly major undertaking, and needs a fairly large community to make it happen.  If you don't have such a community, you'll need to build one.

You can pretty much count on something going on every two weeks, often at college campuses. Unfortunately a lot of it is word of mouth; the centralized resources for advertising don't seem to be comprehensive enough. By far the best way to get into the scene is to go to one of the conventions such as Intercon and make connections from there. One big part of any of these games (that tend to run the whole weekend) or conventions is the "shameless plugs" section, where people promote what they're working on and try to get early signups.<br/><br/>Intercon Midatlantic has been, as Lisa noted, cancelled for this year. It and the larger Intercon in Boston were sort of the keystones for that community. The Boston one is still going strong. <br/><br/>In the Maryland/DC/Virginia area there used to be a number of very intensive campaign games going on, but few of them are left. I wrote and ran for both Brassy's Men and Lullaby of Broadway, with the aforementioned Mike Young. I don't know of any efforts of similar scale going on in the region now.<br/><br/>Unfortunately none of this amounts to terribly practical advice as far as how you can go about getting involved, but it sounds like others have been able to offer some pointers there. I've been out of the larp 'scene' for a few years now. Larpers also love to talk about their games and plug upcoming events, so I'd bet that if you were to contact any of the people mentioned here they'd be happy to help nudge you along. Mike's a good friend; I know he wouldn't mind getting pinged.

So instead of telling you generic stuff about how awesome our local games are, I'll make it more specific.<br/><br/>So there's this thing that happens with adventure-oriented campaign larps (both live combat and non). A campaign will run for many years, and some of the characters will attend constantly, becoming more and more powerful (and all the while, new people join with brand spanking new low powered characters). Eventually they'll become so powerful that if a GM puts out a monster that is a challenge for an experienced player, it wipes the floor with any newbies it comes across. And if a GM puts out a monster that is an appropriate challenge for a newbie, the old timer can wipe it out with a casual flick of the wrist. NERO is the flagship game for having this problem, but it shows up constantly in other games, usually after around 2 to 3 years in. World of Darkness campaign games have the problem in spades as well.<br/><br/>Various games take all sorts of bandaid approaches to the problem. They inflate starting character points every year or so, so that new characters start off more powerful than they used to. They create levelled mods of content designed for low, middle, and high powered characters. They rely on player goodwill, expecting the experienced players to just not engage with the easy monsters and expecting the newbies to be OK with running away a lot from the big stuff or maybe giving newbies "extra lives" that expire when they get more points.<br/><br/>But most of these fixes don't address the core of the problem, as I see it. I come to a larp to play the game with the other players there. Sure, I don't expect everything to be all perfectly balanced and even. But I expect to be able to have a solid way to contribute to what's going on even if I'm a newbie to that system. And in the games where this problem is at it's worst, I just can't really play side by side with the old hands - the things they are interested in fighting are too tough for me and the things I can fight are no challenge to them. So I might as well not even be playing the same game with them.<br/><br/>So one thing that's neat about the SoCal scene is this: 3 different games have tackled the problem with 3 differnent solutions, each of which is pretty darn effective (though I have my preferences among them).<br/><br/>One game, called Eidolon, addressed the problem by building upkeep into the points system. Each cycle, you would have to pay upkeep points on your current skills before spending points on new skills. So you rather quickly reach a point where all your points are going into upkeep and you can't afford any new skills unless you drop some old ones. Also, you had other things you could use your cycle points on - the game had a lot of town simulation elements in it, and you could use your time points toward building structures and plowing land and things like that. It was a neat solution - especially the fact that the "downtime system" and growth system were completely integrated. But unfortunately, tracking upkeep points proved to be a complete nightmare logistically. You'd need a well designed database system to have any hope of managing it effectively. But a super streamlined version might have potential.<br/><br/>Another game, called Xaria, addresses the issue primarily through reducing the significance of growth. They make starting characters plenty good at what they do, and then cap growth potential. A starting fighter character is plenty good at fighting, and over time gets just a little bit better. A starting mage has a few spells but they're already maxed in magnitude - over time they pick up a few more to round out their abilities. The game also reduces the significance of growth in a few other ways. They have basically no game economy - your character is as rich as you feel like bringing coin objects to represent. Only magic items are regulated, which are capped at 7 total items, most of which are not heavily powerful - things like a potion or scroll that does the same things that spells do. Also, they've removed accidental death - when characters are knocked out they get up 5 minutes later unless someone specifically comes up and cuts their throat, which GMs almost never have their NPCs do - and therefore there's no need to hoard powers in order to keep your character alive. Overall, these rules make it so that the players just relax and enjoy the story content of the event they're in and aren't worried about gaining and holding character power. It's a pretty effective approach for a group that is willing to relax on the "gamist" elements of play, but it arguably produces a game that lacks teeth somewhat.<br/><br/>Another game, called Dying Kingdoms, takes my favorite approach to addressing the issue. They use a growth and retirement cycle. Characters grow and get pretty powerful and influential in the game world. After about 3 years of play, a character has big badass powers and is considered a mover and shaker in society. At that point, the GMs work with that player to directly address the story elements they are interested - they will write an event or two specifically designed to bring that character to a big finish of some sort. Then the character retires from active play (though the player may occasionally reprise them in an NPC capacity) and the player starts a brand new character from scratch that has one small perk that normal starting players don't get as a thank you for playing along with the retirement system (such as getting to play an otherwise restricted race, for example). This is an awesome approach on so many levels. It keeps the growth system from getting out of control without completely neutering it. It makes it so everyone gets their spotlight time - even someone who started years later than the first players will still get their apex time after they play for a while. And it means that character stories have the opportunity to be resolved - and they can be big, world changing conclusions. One character became the Emperor. Another did such important stuff with magic that he permanently changed part of the magic system. And as a cultural side effect, many of the players who retire characters end up spending several months as pure staff for a while before they bring in a new character, so the system ends up helping reduce the GM burden as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377573/#Comment_377573" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-10T13:24:40+00:00" title="May 10, 2012  1:24PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, the "two-speed game problem" is common. I try to address it in three ways, with GLASS rules Toggles:<br/>1) Zero Growth - Experience may only be spent on Abilities that have the Single Use, Focus, or Tool Limitation (or a combination of them). In short: Exp must be spent on items.<br/>2) Balanced Growth - When players spend Experience on their characters, they must balance the expenditure with a Defect worth equivalent Experience, for which they do not receive Bonus Experience as they would at character creation. This option represents a game in which gaining additional capabilities above and beyond Starting Experience \u201ccorrupts\u201d or \u201cdegenerates\u201d a character.<br/>3) Constrained Growth - Stuff costs higher and higher multiples of Experience, as one gains "Ranks". A sort of diminishing returns cycle that *should* encourage veterans to retire eventually.<br/><br/>I also have Unlimited Growth, but I advise games to only use it if the world is VERY lethal/realistic, and I also advice what Rob said above: Keep the vet and newbie content clearly separated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377604/#Comment_377604" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-10T15:31:35+00:00" title="May 10, 2012  3:31PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 10, 2012 3:32PM by RobMcDiarmid.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You should add "Cycle Growth" as another toggle.

Having a limited run for the whole storyline makes it not a problem at all.<br/><br/>But I'd argue that that's a different kind of game structure right from the beginning. It's like the equivilant of a TV miniseries instead of a "22 episodes a year and we have no idea how many years it's going to go on for" show. The latter being the much more common structure used in America both for TV shows and for fantasy live combat games (unfortunately).<br/><br/>I refer to those kinds of games as miniseries games rather than campaign games, because they are so inherently different.\n<blockquote>Power escalation is a design choice. Campaign larps don't have to make it.</blockquote>\nIt's been my experience that designers don't consciously make the choice at the start to have a power escalation system that will result in a 2 speed (or even 3 speed in cases I've heard about) game. They just lack the foresight to design a game that will work in the long term.<br/><br/>It's very common for a designer to approach their game with the idea that they'll just bang around with the rules for a while to see what's fun and what works. Then, after 1-2 years, they'll start to revise things a bit, putting on a bandaid for the biggest problems. Then they put on another bandaid. Then they put on another bandaid. And by the time they realise that they would have needed to design in a structure that would address the problem from the beginning, it's way too late and they have too many people who are too invested in the broken power escalation system.<br/><br/>Which is why I'm pointing out games that have taken approaches, right from the start, to address the issue with mechanics that work to one degree or another (or almost work but turn out to be too painful in the form they're in). Because designing with that foresight from the beginning is so dang rare.<br/><br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Oh, and Dave, I'd argue that Constrained Growth, which is probably the most commonly applied bandaid solution, doesn't consistently work. As evidence, I would point to the many many games that use it but still have a 2 speed game. It's a "finger in the dyke" approach at best, and doesn't actually fix the problem, just slows it.<br/><br/>Constrained Growth still incentivizes maintaining the same character and growing in power indefinitely. It still incentivizes doing anything you can do to not lose your character and lose your "progress" - which in turn incentivizes things like not taking all your hits. And it still means that the people who played the game for 3 years before you showed up have permanent advantages in power that will never go away as long as they keep attending regularly and that the new player will ALWAYS be behind the power curve, even if they close the gap a bit eventually. In fact, it actually incentivizes the new players to do things that help them catch up, like not giving a ride to game to a more experienced player because then they won't make it and get their XP - not that I've seen evidence of that sort of thing playing out, but the incentive is there in the structure and could be working as a subtle influence on behavior.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>So, Kira, you wanted to see what the larp scene is like? Arguing about rules implementations is kind of a thing. Enough people have written enough different rulesets and enough people have gotten exposure to them, so that debate about best practices in design are somewhat common, especially on the internet where people from different game experiences are communicating.<br/><br/>Larps have had a "make your own ruleset instead of buying one" thing going on for a long time, with the World of Darkness system being the biggest notable exception. NERO kind of fills the D&amp;D role, in that many people have played it but many many have hacked it into something else they like better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377807/#Comment_377807" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-11T10:56:29+00:00" title="May 11, 2012 10:56AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>So, Kira, you wanted to see what the larp scene is like?

It's really good.  Great original premise,  lots of angst and formality and colour, and an interesting structure.  Also interesting from a gender issues perspective - the game loaded the mechanics so that the Lady characters had most of the agency in the game - we got to choose who we danced with, and compete with each other, and get tokens for mechanical effects, and decide who we wanted to marry.  The Lords were forced to take a more passive role, although they did get powers and the right to duel.  (Although, when I say angst, I really mean it - some of the back stories were kinda triggering.)<br/><br/>And I got a hat trick - found my true love, worked out who the monster was, and helped fix one of the Duke's problems.
