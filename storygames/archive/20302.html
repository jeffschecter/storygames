It's an opportunity to connect with potential playtesters.<br/><br/><b>Principles for posting:</b><br/><br/>* Tell us about your game(s) in one post. Feel free to mention your game even if you've talked about it in last month's thread. The idea is to inform us about what you're doing now.<br/><br/>* Optionally: tell us what you're hoping to achieve this month or what you did last month.<br/><br/>* If you want to link to another thread, post, or rules document, go for it.<br/><br/>* There's no maximum number of games you can talk about. If developing your game is a genuine focus for you this month, then put it up. <br/><br/><br/><b>If you're responding to a game someone else has posted about:</b><br/><br/>* Number your response (first response: [1]; second response [2]; third response [3]). If you see that you're the second person to post, "Wow, that looks cool!" to a post here, then put a "[2]" at the top of your post. <br/><br/>* The fourth person to post should just take their comment and create a new thread (or talk on an existing thread about the game), to continue the discussion.<br/><br/><br/><b>Previous Thread</b><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20212/games-in-playtesting-development-june-2015" rel="nofollow">June 2015</a> (we skipped July 2015)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447548/#Comment_447548" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-02T08:29:32+00:00" title="August  2, 2015  8:29AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I busy working on <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5pV27F3R0veOFRZVm1MX21EamM" rel="nofollow">Heavy Metal Heroes</a>, which is for one-shot games that could be from crazy metal songs.<br/><br/>It's a minimal Apocalypse World-based system, with some structure for building your quest, and a big list of metal characters to play.

I'm pleased with how it's going. <br/>Broadly speaking, the game is turning out exactly the kind of stories it's supposed to. At the same time, each session has thrown up something that needs a tweak or needs to be explained more clearly in the game text. So that's pretty great. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447582/#Comment_447582" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-03T17:52:09+00:00" title="August  3, 2015  5:52PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 3, 2015 5:53PM by WarriorMonk.">edited August 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After the third playtest, <i>Offline </i> is being streamlined a bit more. The rules are there and work, now all left is finish three more comic pages to explain them, add some illustrations to the character creation part and more work on the procedures to GM chapter; I prefer not to call it GM advice since from the beginning I was planning a game for people with no previous experience on roleplaying.<br/><br/>So far I think it has succeeded; the youngest player of the party came to the session with his mom (who hadn't played an RPG in her whole life and probably only overheard us playing a bit of D&amp;D a couple of times) and we invited her to play with us. She did great and told us that she enjoyed the game, which meant the world to us. <br/><br/>There was a couple of interesting misunderstandings: at first she tought she had to play more than one character. Another player new to RPGs thought he was going to play as the king, a position that he was only meant to have for the world creation procedure. Yet I thought it was interesting and suggested him to play as the prince.<br/><br/>Playtesting also made me create a few more procedures to create adventures on the go, which I'm still working to simplify. After that part is done I should be looking for an inexperienced player to try and GM the game and see how it goes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447591/#Comment_447591" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-03T19:52:16+00:00" title="August  3, 2015  7:52PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Josh Jordan and I are working together to revise and re-release two of my games through Ginger Goat (the publishers of Doll and Heroine and some other cool games). We want your feedback to help us make the games tighter and easier to learn.<br/><br/>\u201cThe Devil, John Moulton\u201d is a GM led occult western, where you play demon summoning outlaws searching the old west for the man you to whom you sold your soul and now you want it back.  It can be played as a single session or short campaign.<br/><a href="http://nickwedig.libraryofhighmoon.com/2014/04/the-devil-john-moulton/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://nickwedig.libraryofhighmoon.com/2014/04/the-devil-john-moulton/</a><br/><br/>\u201cNameless Horror\u201d is a semi-competitive GMless single session game about ordinary people accidentally entangled in something horrible.  Most of you won\u2019t make it out alive.  The game uses some Tarot-like cards of ambiguous imagery to create dreamlike, inexplicable tales of terror.<br/><a href="http://nickwedig.libraryofhighmoon.com/2013/10/nameless-horror-version-0-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://nickwedig.libraryofhighmoon.com/2013/10/nameless-horror-version-0-2/</a><br/><br/>Right now we're looking for groups willing to playtest the original versions of the game and give us their feedback.
