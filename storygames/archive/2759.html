This started when I read a thread Jonathan started about the cognitive dissonance of having his character do something he didn't expect, as the results of stakes. (I can't find this thread now. Grrr.) I've been doing a bunch of improv recently, and this has clearly influenced my thoughts on the process. I've talked about it a bit over in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2721" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>, and my Game Chef entry, A Penny For My Thoughts, dealt pretty clearly with this issue.<br/><br/>So what I keep circling is this: how much can we as players reasonably expect to know what our characters will do? On a related note, how much do we as humans really know about we ourselves will do? This was hammered home when I was having a conversation with my wife the other night, and I said that I had just realized something about myself with regards to an unexpected emotional response. My wife wasn't surprised, saying that it was consistent with her model of me. If I can be surprised myself so much, why not be surprised by my character?<br/><br/>--Paul                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62977/#Comment_62977" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-04T14:48:59+00:00" title="April  4, 2007  2:48PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2007 2:51PM by Josh Roby.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Comparing "what people do" with "what characters do" can be dangerous ground, because people and characters are only superficially similar.  The impulse to make them more similar is rooted (I think) in a desire for verisimilitude, which isn't a bad thing.  It's just an assumption that should not be overlooked.<br/><br/>Consider, for instance, Kevin Spacey's character Verbal in <em>The Usual Suspects</em>.  (If you haven't seen this movie, then stop reading this thread and go rent it; otherwise, this movie is 12 years old so I don't have many compulsions about spoilers.)  The final sequence of the movie completely redefines Verbal's character as we the audience know him.  He's not a person; he's a character who serves a purpose in the story which is designed to entertain us.  When he loses his limp and hops into the car, the <em>character</em> changes, but it doesn't become more in line with the "person" behind that character.  There's no person there; it's just the facade of a character that can quicksilver-change whenever it's entertaining for the audience to do so.<br/><br/>Now, characters in RPGs are not the same thing as characters in movies.  In many games, we players build up this sense of a person behind the character -- the motives and motivations that provoke the actions and statements they make.  On the other hand, we have other games which break this connection by dictating actions through the result of mechanics.  If the mechanics say I betray the king, then it's not my conception of the "person" that is inspiring that action.  I would suggest that in such a game, it is the character facade that inspires the conception of the person, not the other way around.  We as players have to continually redefine the "person" behind the character.  Now, I find this hella fun; I know that a lot of people really do not, and find it something of a violation of their creative ownership of the character.  It can wreak havoc on immersion (I think).<br/><br/>It seems to me that these are two different ways to play (although they may be two ends of a spectrum, dunno).  Realizing that they are two approaches (and, it seems to me, rather exclusive approaches) may allow us to better describe play in different games.  The question for me is: how do we create a game that replicates the characterization of Verbal?  I have some starts of answers myself, but I'd love to see other thoughts, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62980/#Comment_62980" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-04T14:54:37+00:00" title="April  4, 2007  2:54PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "You don't ever <i>really</i> know yourself" seems to be the stuff of all great drama. For instance, I bet the majority of murders were committed by people who never dreamed they could kill someone. We find out all the time that we're nobler or more cowardly or more selfish or more selfless than we thought we were. <br/><br/>Fiction-wise, though, I believe the seeds of this unexpected reaction have to be somewhere within the character. The right stimuli were needed to bring it out, no more. "Holy shit, I never thought he'd DO that!" is well and good, but "Holy shit, I never... Oh, oh yeah. Yeah, he would. Whoa." is even better. And I strongly suspect this is often true in real life as well.<br/><br/>Another point of interest is that sometimes people don't know themselves as well as they thought, but others--particularly those close to them--have a better insight. That may be one reason why you surprised yourself but not your wife in the example you gave. <br/><br/>The last point gives me an idea. Maybe some of a character's traits, in the form of FATE's Aspects, TSOY's Keys, DitV's traits or whatever, could be given into the "keeping" of other players/characters. These are the parts of that character's psyche that he himself is clueless about, but those close to him know well. A bit like the chargen in Best Friends, when you think about it. When that trait comes up the other player(s) can invoke it for in-game effect, say like tagged Aspects in SotC. When the character is forced to confront this part of himself the trait goes to the character's keeping while the character struggles with this new self-discovery, while the players who originally had the trait in keeping get XP or some such reward. More of a seed of an idea and I'm not sure how workable it is, but just something that popped up.<br/><br/>To expand on a bit, maybe some of the character's traits are self-delusions. For instance A might believe he would never turn his back on a friend, but he'd actually do so in a heartbeat if it meant he could ascend the throne. This is pretty much a case of key deletion in TSOY. Similarly, in conjunction with the above idea, B might have a trait of A's that the throne is more important to A than anything--even friends. Heck, maybe no one has any idea which is true. That would only be tested if A were ever forced to choose between a friend and the throne. It's basically a case of conflicting Beliefs, Aspects or Keys.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62981/#Comment_62981" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-04T14:55:51+00:00" title="April  4, 2007  2:55PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a weird, similar experience when we did the playtest for 8, my gamechef entry. I realized after the game that we had essentially played ourselves, but in the process we did things that were unexpected from us. I can't quite put my finger on what we did that "wasn't us" but there was something in the way we interacted in the game that was different enough for me to notice.<br/><br/> I think that "self" is a construct of what we tell ourselves about ourselves and our characters are more so. This may be more pronounced in hippy games with freeform stats. "Afraid of the dark- 3D4" says a lot more about a character that "STR-15". You are both freed from and tied to what you have said about your character for continuity. <br/><br/>This is rambling in my head and the words are not coming out right, but you are on to something keep looking. Don't expect the answer to be the same for every one.

In a given game, your understanding of your character can be an external perspective or an internal one.  If your perspective is external, your conception of character is based on the character's actions, which you have incomplete control over.  You must continually revise your conception of character based on those actions.  If your perspective is internal, your conception of character is what motivates actions.  In such games, you usually have complete control over what your characters <em>attempt</em>, and then the dice tell you if they are successful.  Your conception of character is sacrosanct and canonical, and totally up to you.<br/><br/>(I'm not entirely sure if this is an IIEE thing.

In my current design, the opening text says that player-participants ("seiyuu" or "voice actors," different from the "producer") are "responsible" for one or more characters. (I put "responsible" in quotes as I'm realizing I either need to clarify what I mean by this in the opening text or make it very clear throughout the rules.) This should establish some distance between player and character. This distance is reinforced during initial character creation, which is done round-robin style, with each player contributing one or more things to each character. Further, the person who came up with the character won't necessarily take on that character as his "main character" - everyone chooses a main character after initial creation is complete. What I hope this will engender (not having playtested yet) is a certain level of distance between player and character, mixed with a certain responsibility to further that character's story and be her advocate.<br/><br/>In play, conflicts can cause parts of the character ("elements") to come under the control of another player, like severely damage aspects in WGP... These don't allow the player controlling those lost elements to force the character to do contradictory things (we are talking about contradictions, here, right?), but it does open up the possibility for those elements to *change* - sometimes drastically. So an Attitude of Love for another character may change to Hate...or to Love for a different character, depending on the mechanics and how currency is spent. Again, all of this will be explicit in the rules.<br/><br/>I'm pretty certain that this design won't be for everyone's tastes, but my focus will be on making clear what the expectation is, so participants don't fall into the trap of false expecations regarding character "control." In play, things can happen to characters that are outside of their players' control, but the rules should make such possibilities clear.

If we give narrative control over a character to someone else, I think they have a responsibility to take these concerns into account. a) Could require a justification for the character's actions.  b) could require a conversation about how the character could now be differently enjoyable, or how the change to the character doesn't change that enjoyment.  c) could require suggestions on new directions for the character's story.<br/><br/>You can avoid these issues by,  as people have already said, explicitly changing expectations before the game begins.  You could agree that:<br/><br/>a) Characters are going to be fluent, so don't get too attached to a particular vision.<br/>b) We'll alter the game flow to make sure different types of characters are fun to play.<br/>c) Let's play something where we have no idea how it turns out.<br/><br/>Again, there might be more concerns, but overall it seems like we should acknowledge them and find ways to explicitly handle them within our game. And that's not just for shared-narrative games: even in a GM'ed game, things often happen to characters that might relate to these concerns. I played in an AD&amp;D 2e game where a dwarf character was kidnapped and had his ears cut off and his face slashed. Personally, I'd think that would be fun to play, but the player of that character would have preferred the character to die and soon retired him. The character was no longer fun to play and wasn't like the player had imagined him.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Call%20Me%20Curly" title="Call Me Curly"><img alt="Call Me Curly" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Call%20Me%20Curly">Call Me Curly</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63070/#Comment_63070" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-05T18:01:01+00:00" title="April  5, 2007  6:01PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 5, 2007 6:01PM by Call Me Curly.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My mind always jumps to <a href="http://ptgptb.org/0026/narrativists.html" rel="nofollow">this bookmark</a>, whenever I encounter someone<br/>speaking about the sanctity of their vision of their character.<br/><br/><br/>And I always think of John Cassevetes' movie Faces, as an alternative.<br/><br/>Here's Prof. Ray Carney, on Faces:<br/><br/>"Cassevetes understood that people wear masks in life and hide behind dependable roles in their relationships with others for the same reasons actors do in their performances. It is safer and more comfortable to play a fixed role than to make oneself genuinely responsive to the shocks and jars of an open-ended relationship\xe2\u20ac\u201con-stage or off-. A related parallel between bad acting and bad living, in Cassavetes' view of it, is the desire to "star" rather than interact. Like Jack Nicholson, Meryl Streep, and Harvey Keitel (three of America's most over-rated actors), we want others to respond to our emotional pacings and emphases, rather than making ourselves responsive to others.<br/><br/>Ben's beat generation costume (black leather jacket and sunglasses even indoors and at night), affectless tones (disillusioned, self-pitying, and already burnt-out at age 21\xe2\u20ac\u201c"Maybe I'll join a little group in Vegas"), and Tom-catting (forever on the prowl for a different girl every night) allow him to be the long-running star of his own one-man road show, but by the same virtue, they deny him possibilities of emotional openness to or involvement with anyone other than himself and his own problems. Lelia's self-centered self-dramatizations are more inventive and interesting than Ben's monotone posturing, but ultimately no different from it. Her Garboism (or Meryl Streepism) cuts her off from experience in the same way his Brandoism does: it gives her star billing in a repertory company in which she plays the most important part, lets no one upstage her, steal her scenes, or get within a mile of her emotionally.<br/><br/>Like bad actors, in their different ways, Ben, Lelia, Hugh, Rupert, and Tony attempt to get their acts together and work up routines so good they won't ever have to depart from them. Everything Cassavetes stood for was opposed to this sense of "canning" the self or its performances. He saw life and acting not as about getting your part down so pat that you'd never have to think on your feet, but as a process of opening yourself up so completely you could never say in advance where you were going to come out or what you might discover along the way. To quote a Cassavetes' character\xe2\u20ac\u201cyou must "break your pattern."<br/><br/>The issue goes beyond being open or closed to others; what matters is whether one has an open or closed identity. What's really wrong with [finalized] designs for living is that they represent dead-ends for development. Cassavetes subscribes to a state of radical ontological open-endedness, played out in acts of continuous self-revision. The deepest problem with Ben's, Tony's, Lelia's, and Hugh's mask-wearing and role-playing (both as actors and as characters) is that they represent efforts to formulate fixed, finished identities. For Cassavetes, to be finished in this way is to be finished in every other as well. At its best and most exciting, the self is not only unformulated, but unformulatable. You can never close up shop on who you are. Living begins at the very moment you dare to leave the scripts of life behind and begin to improvise on the margins." <a href="http://people.bu.edu/rcarney/cassfilms/shadows.shtml" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://people.bu.edu/rcarney/cassfilms/shadows.shtml</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63084/#Comment_63084" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-05T22:16:54+00:00" title="April  5, 2007 10:16PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's the thing.  I love it when my characters make decisions I didn't expect them to make.<br/><br/>But.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily want to experience the kind of weak character ownership where someone <span style="text-decoration: underline;">else</span> tells me what <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span> do. <br/><br/>But.<br/><br/>I do want a game system to give me incentives to make choices that I don't expect to make.  <br/><br/>Dig?<br/><br/>Aspects in Fate kinda give me that.  I go running off to do thing A, but the GM steps in with a compel and says "ah-ha! your choices are limited in some way you didn't expect.  you gonna run with that or not?"  Fate points are tasty, so I usually take them up on this.  And there's the rub; I made the choice, I still had control, but I had an incentive to make a choice I didn't expect to make.<br/><br/>Behold, my sweet spot!<br/><br/>Which isn't to say I can't enjoy games where I have less control too.  In fact my Game Chef entry, Schizonauts, is very much built around the idea that it's fun to experience NOT having control.  But I think the premise of the game insulates my usual "sweet spot" preferences; because the very question of my character's identity is up in the air, because the table at large is redefining who my character (characters, actually) is on the fly over the course of the game, losing control over my choices is not actually all that bad -- because it's the process whereby I discover who my character is.<br/><br/>Somewhere between my sweet spot and what I'm going after in Schizonauts is something really bizarre and alchemical, and I can't wait until I figure out what that is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63107/#Comment_63107" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-06T09:35:19+00:00" title="April  6, 2007  9:35AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm totally with you, Fred.

After a story arc/several session/ whenever appropriate the group sets down to ascertain who has been roleplaying what traits.

You can always have the character do most anything ... but by doing that they irrevocably become both (a) the person who did that thing and (b) the type of person who might well do that kind of thing habitually.<br/><br/>I do think, however, that some transformations are not as compelling as others.  I could have my blind saint-girl suddenly pull out a knife and stab her friend to death from behind, but that transformation probably won't seem like a compellingly human story.  It would present a big question that should, <i>eventually</i>, be answered ... and if the answer is <b>good</b> then the story as a whole actually becomes incredibly strong.  We love to have our world-view shaken, and then have a new, richer world-view constructed in the rubble.<br/><br/>But in gaming, there's an issue of trust there ... you're asking people to accept the shaking, in exchange for trusting that you'll eventually make sense out of it all.  You'll want to keep within the "budget" that the trust of your fellow players allows you in how far you can diverge from what makes simple, easy sense to them. Dramatic structures like foreshadowing and irony play a big part in this, and so "What is a sensible action for the character?" can actually get influenced by all sorts of entirely out-of-gameworld elements like how scenes are framed, table-talk, and all that jazz. I like seeing that take effect ... it's cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/LitaGemini" title="LitaGemini"><img alt="LitaGemini" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.secondtruth.com/art/undine.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/LitaGemini">LitaGemini</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63340/#Comment_63340" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-09T15:14:47+00:00" title="April  9, 2007  3:14PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm always skeptical of people (one of my on-line games has a player currently doing this) that make a decision as to exactly how they want their character to "end up" over a long term period.  "I'd like to lose all of my faith in humanity by X date, let's do X Y and Z to get me there."  Without some kind of unpredictability, or point of contact where I feel like I could make a difference in the evoultion of this character, I don't see any incentive to play with this character during this phase of his story at all.  Nothing's going to change his mind that he's going to lose his faith in humanity by X date, so the whole interactivity of his story is lost.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there are moments in RP where things change because the "character," and byt that I mean that kind of fundamental personness of that idea, which some posters might deny existing, takes over and makes a choice you might not otherwise expect him/her to make.  I think that's usually an awesome moment, and I prefer that kind of thing to a situation where the rules/game mechanics for some reason made me make that decision instead of it feeling like the character's choice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
