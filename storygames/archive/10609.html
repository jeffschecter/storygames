Both the races I controlled -- plague elves and raksasha -- were non-standard, which made it a lot more fun for me and enabled me to be less uptight about following the rules.  Tony, I think, is also looking for more ways for the game to be looser and create more spaces for player creativity, which is exciting.<br/><br/>I also played Race for the Galaxy, which seems to be more or less the same game as Dominion and San Juan (though earlier, I think).  You spend resources to <b>build</b> farms that <b>produce</b> stuff that you <b>trade</b> for resources.  And then there's this separate track that <b>scores</b> the points you need to win.  I'm finding this whole slew of related games pretty unexciting, actually, since the strategies seem to mostly revolve around building synergies between productive card combinations and that doesn't interest me much, I guess.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235278/#Comment_235278" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-02T14:35:40+00:00" title="October  2, 2009  2:35PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Race for the Galaxy was designed by one of the guys who designed San Juan.

Every time we play, the ruleset reveals another brilliant facet to me.  This time I got to see how the advancement system redirects the natural energy of metagame play into cool fictional consequences.<br><br>During the GM turn, I made a hopeless 1d Persuade roll, one that I self-nerfed with my guy's Cunning trait, against Dack, another PC.  In the fiction, my guy Sumer was trying to pull Dack away from a useless sideshow to our main mission.  I did all this in service to Sumer's Goal ("Complete this dangerous late-fall mission as quickly as possible so I can get home to my weasel friend")  and to my grubby, impure metagame need to improve my character and get myself some screen time during the Player Turn.<br/><br/>So, I tossed my pitiful 1d, nagged Dack perfunctorially, gleefully dotted a Persuade fail and Cunning check, and figured we'd move on.  But Wil the GM reminded me that failure can earn a consequence, and he threw an Angry on Sumer.  Then, when Dack horked up his roll to complete his side mission, Wil threw an Angry on him too. <br/><br/>Now Sumer and Dack are simmering at each other.   We're bickering, behaving suboptimally, selfish prisoners of our emotions.  It felt ... authentic.  I love how the ruleset and Wil combined to prompt that.  And I love how the ruleset will force both Dack's player and me to decide whether we ought to use precious Player Turn checks to get over that.  Forced prioritizations are cool and revealing.  Does this fester into long-running hate?  Or is it the silly moment that brings them closer?<br/><br/>Also, last night I realized that with the exception of the Weather Watcher rules, I have learned everything I needed to know to play Mouse Guard from its character sheet.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236327/#Comment_236327" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-08T08:52:48+00:00" title="October  8, 2009  8:52AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>"My Lord," she says to Maxixcatzin in fluent Nahuatl, "These are not gods but men, and you have but one chance to strike.

We played through an extremely quick Mission in the first session (PC beat both obstacles, accrued no checks...) with unaltered template characters, and had then moved on to creating characters...<br/><br/>We started out tonight (late, unfortunately) by finishing off the new characters, starting from Beliefs / Goals / Instincts. This worked really well after the hiatus, getting everyone back into things. I then started them off on "Deliver the Mail". Ob 6 proved too much for the Tenderpaw's 3 Pathfinding (and the Patrol Guard almost refused to hand off a helping die!), and they ran into the Raven! We got through two rounds of Conflict, in which the greedy (&amp; decidedly lucky!) bird has so far gotten the upper wing at every turn. Unfortunately we didn't have time to continue to the conclusion of the Conflict, but the Disposition score is now Mice 1 of 10 to Raven 11 of 12...

Did one encounter and had to knock off early.<br/><br/>Despite being low on dailies and healing surges, the Crimson Blades decide that they need some closure on the current adventure NOW, so they ignore the cautious counsel of their warlord and storm Taer Shiri's fortress. <br/><br/>Taer Shiri is ready for them.  He has a teleport bolt power and several unbreakable, doorless birdcages hung up in his fortress.  His plan is to teleport at least one PC (hopefully more) into the birdcages, holding them hostage while leaving at least one alive to go and kidnap a baby for him.<br/><br/>Early on, it all goes my way.  First round, the warlord is caged.  Then I get some giant ants into a four-on-one with the ranger.  I knock him down, he fails two death saves.  The fighter sprints over, eats some oppies from my ants, and stabilizes him.  Now the fighter's surrounded.<br/><br/>But meanwhile, Taer Shiri's teleport power refuses to recharge.  He has an avenger and a druid in his face and a caged warlord shouting advice to them.  Taer Shiri takes heavy damage!  FINALLY, Taer Shiri's teleport bolt recharges.  If he cages the avenger, he's probably got enough monsters left to finish things.  But the avenger is not in position to be teleported into captivity.  He needs to move ONE SQUARE towards TS to do this.  <br/><br/>I think about it.  You can count on an avenger to move towards its target, and they are together on top of a 1" wide wall.  Seems like a pretty sure thing!  So TS, who is down to just three hit points, readies an action to fire into that square when the avenger crosses it.  I have you now, I think, gleefully anticipating the negotiations to come--<br/><br/>Surprise!  The avenger has a utility that makes him <i>invisible for one move.</i>  If TS doesn't see the avenger enter the square, his readied action can't go off.  So the avenger fades out, sprints across the battlements, reappears next to TS, and crits him in the face.  Game over.<br/><br/>It's actually kind of a delight when the players bust out a power I didn't know about, and it perfectly foils my plans.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238794/#Comment_238794" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-22T16:18:34+00:00" title="October 22, 2009  4:18PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Last night we burned up some characters for Burning Boston, BW in Colonial Boston.

It was fantastic.<br/><br/>We started out in Judge Dods sitting room, where he asked Ezekial (the praying Indian) and Samuel Maverick (son of the first Samuel Maverick) to get the confessions of the indians who burned down John Brown's house. Of course, the Wampanoag chief Wamsutta had mysteriously died just steps from Brown's door a few months before, but none of the colonists really thought about that.<br/><br/>Maverick (played by the indomitable John Harper) immediately assumed the indian's innocence, and pushed Dods, then the local Constable, to try to find inaccuracies in their accounts. A few failed rolls and people were starting to look at Maverick funny, thinking he cared about this a little too much. Problem is, the first thing the only english-speaking captive did was proudly acknowledge what they had done.<br/><br/>The 'interrogation' included Maverick allowing the warparty leader to tear up his confession to keep the peace a little longer, and Ezekial (played by the great Paul Riddle) having to deal with one of the captives who wanted to convert.<br/><br/>Since Maverick allowed the first confession he transcribed to be torn up, he and Ezekial set to writing a new one, but with the intention of it also being a manifesto for colonist/native relations. One barely failed roll later, everyone took note of the document (which the nailed to a few doors around town), but assumed it was just an eccentric charity case of Maverick's. In light of this, Judge Dods decided to allow a full trial after all, but with Ezekial and Maverick presenting the defense.<br/><br/>With only a few days to prepare, Maverick and Ezekial decided to head to Cambridge, the site of the fire, to look for evidence. Of course they had some other goals in being there as well: gathering supplies for the coming winter, as well as investigating the possible magical causes of Wamsutta's death.<br/><br/>Maverick managed to detect and find Nekoti, the spirit that killed Wamsutta, and make contact with him in the woods. Ezekial fell in with an indian hunting party intent on keeping this spirit from taking over another soul. After a tense showdown with knives at throats and some Fear spells flying, everyone backed off with no clear winner: Maverick learned Nekoti worked for a white man named Digges and showed some power over the spirit, Ezekial learned that Maverick can do magic, and the Wampanoag now believe that Maverick has always controlled Nekoti (due to some failed rolls).<br/><br/>We closed the session with Zeke and Maverick arriving at Mayor Little's house in Cambridge, since they had been invited to dine there. Of course they were seated between Little's eligible daughters...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike" title="Steerpike"><img alt="Steerpike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/73053145/4961238"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike">Steerpike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239649/#Comment_239649" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-29T13:47:55+00:00" title="October 29, 2009  1:47PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sage - AWESOME SAUCE.<br/><br/>- Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239666/#Comment_239666" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-29T15:43:49+00:00" title="October 29, 2009  3:43PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 29, 2009 3:50PM by John_Harper.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Burning Boston]<br/><br/>I piled on a lot of dice for that Write test when Samuel composed his manifesto on colonist/native unity.

I've often tried to get players to offer testimony about each others' awesomeness -- I recently put a D&amp;D character on trial just to see if I could get the other players to testify in his favor -- but as usual, Mouse Guard does it better with system than I do with just straight fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239710/#Comment_239710" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-30T05:54:19+00:00" title="October 30, 2009  5:54AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D&amp;D; 4E:<br/>\n- mummy rot<br/>\n- undead sphinx<br/>\n- spelljamming pirates<br/>\n- next stop, carceri!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Bite-Size AP: October 2009 - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10609/bite-size-ap-october-2009/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Bite-Size AP: October 2009 - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10609/bite-size-ap-october-2009/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Posted By: jenskot - next stop, carceri!

We have to break someone out of a carceri prison and convince them to help us destroy an artifact. Except this person is elgedly dangerous, doesn't know us, and has no reason to help us! For all we know, they want to stay where they are. I'm most excited about trying to drag him out alive than actually breaking in.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterdays game was fun but also slow. The problem was pure dice rolling. We all did the same things we usually do but we probably missed 60-70% of the time. The pacing is almost too random.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I enjoy running out of resources. I find stunts become even more fun when you have no where else to turn!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10609/bite-size-ap-october-2009" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10609/bite-size-ap-october-2009" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10609/bite-size-ap-october-2009/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F10609%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F10609%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
