It's a narration-trading game, it's not *exactly* an RPG,<br/>though it's close.  It's designed for two players, though there are rules for<br/>expanding it to more.  The constants of the game are, that it's about a badass<br/>hero of one kind or another (and there are a number of kinds, and you can make<br/>your own), in a strange location.  In the location are a Monster, who will kill<br/>you, and a Lover, who is willing.  The game is written using the first person<br/>for the quasi-GM, and the second for the quasi-player.<br/><br/>The "player" chooses a description for the hero, and a location, from<br/>a list, and adds to the description.  The "player" also makes up a<br/>Goal for the hero that he is trying to achieve in that location (this<br/>is not chosen from a list.)<br/><br/>The "GM" elaborates the description of the location, and creates from<br/>whole cloth a Monster and a Lover who will be there.  For the Monster<br/>he chooses from four pairs of descriptions, i.e. does the monster<br/>attack Singly or in a Group, in a Civilized or Savage way, and the<br/>same deal for the Lover, does she desire the hero Innocently or<br/>Wantonly, Helplessly or Knowledgeably, etc.  Other than choosing from<br/>those pairs, the GM is making things up out of whole cloth, not<br/>choosing from a list.<br/><br/>The "GM" describes a place within the location, which includes the<br/>Lover.  The "player" describes his entering the place.<br/><br/>After that play proceeds in a series of "Goes."  On your Go, you<br/>describe what happens next.  The other person can suggest and<br/>contribute but you have final say on what happens.  You can control<br/>the other person's "stuff" during your Go -- the GM can describe what<br/>the hero does during his Go, and the hero can describe what the other<br/>things in the world do during his Go.  So it's unlike a traditional<br/>game in that way.  But the player still invests himself primarily in<br/>the hero, and the gm still primarily focuses on external forces and<br/>persons.<br/><br/>You can tweak how "tight" you want to play it, making it a little more<br/>or less like a traditional RPG in that way.<br/><br/>Each "Go" contains exactly one significant forward-moving event, one<br/>thing that happens that moves the story forward, changes how things<br/>are happening.  Once that happens, your Go will be over soon.  You<br/>can't hog the story -- ony one major even happens before you give<br/>control back to the other character.<br/><br/>At a certain point the Match will start.  It starts when the player<br/>takes decisive action towards the goal, or the GM has the monster<br/>make a significant move.<br/><br/>The Match is something that happnes during Goes -- the GM and player<br/>not only move the story forward, but also collect a stack of dice<br/>which will determine the outcome of the story.  They get dice for<br/>totally different things.  the GM gets dice for having the monster<br/>smack down the hero. the player gets dice for taking action towards<br/>the goal, and either accepting or rejecting the Lover, physically and<br/>otherwise.<br/><br/>There are certain limits during all these Goes -- you can't<br/>definitively kill off the Hero or the Monster (though you can appear<br/>to) -- nor definitively obtain or lose the Goal -- all the things that<br/>are going to be determined by the Match have to remain on the table.<br/>Other than that, anything goes during Goes.<br/><br/>Eventually some conditions obtain which trigger a final determination<br/>of the outcome of the match.  This will mean that the player either<br/>gets the goal or fails to get it, and also gets a certain number (zero<br/>or more) of Good Dice, each of which is used to purchase a positive<br/>outcome.  If you don't explicitly purchase a positive outcome, you<br/>don't get it.<br/> <br/>Positive outcomes include:<br/><br/>* overriding a failure to get the Goal, and getting it anyway<br/>* Killing the monster<br/>* not getting killed or horribly wounded by the monster<br/>* saving another character who is in danger, including the Lover<br/><br/>etc.<br/><br/>You also choose as a player (unconstrained by the dice) whether you<br/>accept or reject the lover, and if you accept them, whether you stay<br/>with them in the location or take them with you.<br/><br/>After the determination of the outcome, you keep playing in Goes until<br/>you've made all those things happen one way or the other.<br/><br/>Then you switch roles, and the "gm" is the new "player" and vice<br/>versa.<br/><br/>If your hero dies, you make a new hero next time it's your turn to be<br/>the player.<br/><br/>If you stay with the Lover, you are done being the Player, and don't<br/>get to make a new hero.  Your story is over.<br/><br/>Otherwise there are rules for how the outcome of this story affects<br/>subsequent stories with your hero.<br/><br/>And that's about it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>OK, that's a big-ass nutshell.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229437/#Comment_229437" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T18:45:21+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  6:45PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool. <br/><br/>That did not suck.
