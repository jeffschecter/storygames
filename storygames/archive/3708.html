The object of the game is to increase the stress of other characters until they snap and commit murder.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe writing in bile is very offensive and rude. So please don't read it if you're easily offended. Please give it a shot and either send your review to rpg.net or post an actual play thread right here at story games.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to contact me, you can leave me a message here or e-mail me at mj-graham@hotmail.co.uk<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you in advance,<br/>\nMarcus Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markv" title="markv"><img alt="markv" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markv">markv</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83225/#Comment_83225" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T10:58:16+00:00" title="July 25, 2007 10:58AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I only review games at rpg.net if they cost at least $10.

The character sheet is ugly and I can understand why you said its subject matter is derivative of Kill Puppies For Satan. I've never played Wuthering Heights, so I can't possible say that the rules for Bile aren't similar.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thanks once again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham" title="MJGraham"><img alt="MJGraham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nEPVXFCEJAK2O.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham">MJGraham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83287/#Comment_83287" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T13:06:36+00:00" title="July 25, 2007  1:06PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark,<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not Graham W. But I do have to give him credit for inspiring me to make a very unserious game (see his recent thread in Games and Gaming). I was originally trying to write an Enid Blyton style investigative game and I couldn't quite figure out how to make it work. I had several ideas stirring around in my brain and my favourite idea to branch off from the original concept just happened to be one where the game wasn't about solving the crime. It was about commiting the crime. Think of all those murder mysteries where the detective gives expositional dialogue during his accusation speech. All the whys and hows and whos. Well I was going to use that for the structure of a game, then I read Graham W's thread, and the rest is pretty obvious.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou've probably guessed that the character sheet was meant to be ugly. The whole game is meant to be ugly and unpleasant, much like the characters players are supposed to roleplay. It's a silly quirk of mine to write games as a character from the game would do them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm definitely going to pick up Wuthering Heights as I'm a big fan of games that go against the grain of traditional rpgs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
