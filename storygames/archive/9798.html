I also want to know what they do for you!</p>\n<p>The obvious thing they do is give a quick, sketchy idea of the character -- it's a fun, collaborative way to do author characters.  As Charles points out in the parent thread, the fact that they're authored not just by you is incredibly important.  You'll never get "your character" back, and I find that a lot of fun as a player (incidentally, it also helps me avoid a perpetual pitfall of playing "Darcy's Stock Character #1").</p>\n<p>The other thing that they do for me is to provide a solid foundation for cooking up the Memory NPCs that I'll need to create as I play.  With a decent sense of who the Trooper was (and what his relationship with his family was like) before going to war, I find it much easier to tease out new &amp; re-occurring NPCs as I need them.  Sometimes the new NPCs are actually new, and only inspired by the background stats.  Sometimes, the new NPCs are actually featured in the background stats.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, since the inclusion of an NPC in a Memory is mandatory, the Backgrounds do have a mechanical benefit -- they help me meet the game's fictional content criteria for getting my big honkin' mechanical bennie.</p>\n<p>What do they do for you?<br/>\nD</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218049/#Comment_218049" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-13T12:11:27+00:00" title="July 13, 2009 12:11PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for posting this Darcy.  <br/><br/>It's interesting that you point out the background information being necessary for Memories simply because in my limited play we didn't see much Memory use.  I believe this was simply due to getting used to the rules and tools at your disposal.  <br/><br/>I really don't have a whole lot to say other than I absolutely love the fact that trooper creation is shared.  My group thought about propagating this element to other systems.  Stuff like having another player determine your Connection/Nemesis in PTA or one of your relationships in Dogs.<br/><br/>But yeah, I concur with everything that has been said.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dyson%20Logos" title="Dyson Logos"><img alt="Dyson Logos" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dyson%20Logos">Dyson Logos</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218222/#Comment_218222" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-14T07:38:18+00:00" title="July 14, 2009  7:38AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess the issue with us is that we can cook up memory NPCs on the fly without any frame of reference whatsoever.
