Things are abstracted and monolithic, so you get disappointing things like a thief spending two turns to sneak around for a backstab and then realizing that he's done one point of damage instead of a possible two. Some poor rolls in random character generation meant my guy had a 16% of hitting a goblin. We were re-writing the game as we went. On the bright side it is a nice package, lots of fun components in a little set-up box that reminded me of the early eighties.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272768/#Comment_272768" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-24T10:18:28+00:00" title="May 24, 2010 10:18AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nothing special.

Up to now I've been VERY laid back about all of my gaming activities, trying not to force on him my hobbies and preferences. This was a welcome turn of events. I decided to use "DungeonSquad" instead of "regular" D&amp;D.<br/><br/>We actually got to play Sunday afternoon, in between bursts of thunderstorm activity. I lit a candle, laid out map tiles, and explained how to make a character, how the game is played, and so on. <br/><br/>About 20 minutes into the game he wanted to stop - one of the NPCs was killed in a pretty grisly fashion (poison spider bite). He said he was "creeped out", so we stopped there. This morning he told me that he was OK with playing again, provided he could pick a healing spell to help out. He <i>really</i> didn't like watching an NPC die. Maybe I should have pulled back a bit on the details? In any case, I thought overall it was a positive experience. We're going to try again this week as time permits.<br/><br/>Anyways, that's what I did.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272857/#Comment_272857" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-24T15:17:15+00:00" title="May 24, 2010  3:17PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I avidly posted to two Google Wave games, one of which is a playtest I'm running, and one forum-based game, when I wasn't distracted by annoying things like "my job", "sleep", "sickness", or "crippling heat/sandstorms"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Esarel" title="Esarel"><img alt="Esarel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Esarel">Esarel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272900/#Comment_272900" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-24T17:07:38+00:00" title="May 24, 2010  5:07PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was also in the Dungeon of Digestion.

To celebrate, we went to the amazingly cool <a href="http://www.cooperhewitt.org/EXHIBITIONS/triennial/why-design-now.asp" rel="nofollow">Why Design Now</a> show at the Cooper Hewitt museum, ate at <a href="http://www.menchankotei.com/" rel="nofollow">Menchanko Tei</a> on 45th (the 55th one had been closed the day before by the health department. Better to be there the day after it's closed by the health department than the day before...), then saw a play written by a friend, then had astoundingly good dessert at <a href="http://www.pasticceriarocco.com/" rel="nofollow">Pasticcieria Rocco</a>. I probably consumed 5000 calories on Friday.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, we went to a cousin's bar mitzvah. It turns out girls are getting much more potent instruction on gender than the boys are. Then we went to the Met and saw <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/special/se_event.asp?OccurrenceId={9C6923D2-D348-4761-BEB3-A943934068D2}" rel="nofollow">Big Bamb\xfa</a>. It's quite beautiful, though there were no remaining tickets to go up into it, so we milled around the base and thought about bamboo, lashing, and the technologies that use such materials and techniques.</p>\n<p>Then we went to <a href="http://cityguideny.com/listingsinfo.cfm?id=450&amp;table=Restaurants&amp;lid=6&amp;cat=12" rel="nofollow">Shanghai Cuisine</a> on Bayard St. in Chinatown. If I were to return, I'd go straight for the soup dumplings and pea greens. Man, that was stupid good.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, we bought a gift certificate to the Strand Bookstore for a friend, then went to his graduation party and gave it to him. It was at <a href="http://www.darbarindia.com/" rel="nofollow">Darbar</a> in Brandford, CT. I ate myself stupid. I still have some biryani in the fridge, but I fear for its safety. The Kheer was astonishingly yummy.
