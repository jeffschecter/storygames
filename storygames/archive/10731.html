I am going to open up my retro sci-fi rpg project Ad Infinitum up to a group development partnership to try and strengthen the brand. The basic premise of the business model I would use will be detailed below but for a bit more indepth look I have a post on A.Net ( http://alternityrpg.net/onlineforums/index.php?showtopic=8479 )<br/>\n  Basically the core of the system is supported in A player's handbook, and the Storyteller section and toolkit for custom made bits of the system will be broken into a separate book. Other than this the parent company will only produce a magazine similar to the dragon, and release tools to ease play experience (possibly similar to D&amp;D insider).  <br/>\n  The next function the "Mission Control" will have is to approve writers whose magazine articles were accepted to create Official (creator owned) Third Party material. The method of publishing will be something along the lines of the flaming cobra imprint, and as the third parties prove themselves more and more reliable come to the point where they can operate as completely automatous company licensed to publish for the game.<br/>\n  The idea is to insure that:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. A certain level of quality and dedication is assured on the part of our third party publishers and we can commit more time to promoting their success as we equally benefit.<br/>\n2. By standardizing the services that the company and third parties use hopefully deeper discounts (in the future) will be available to share.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  The game will be based on the core mechanics of the Alternity system updated into effectively a separate edition. Mind you in no way will this be a clone of Alternity simply taking the base mechanics streamlining the play process and developing our own IP. For those who might truly be interested but don't have an active knowledge of Alternity base books are mighty cheap and I am sure I can help equip people. Interested in 1-4 other interested people, and general opinions on the process as it stands now!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
