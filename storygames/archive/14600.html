Back when I ran D&amp;D in high school I would have pre-scripted grandiose campaigns with heavy plots of tragedy tied into the dungeons and adventures.  I railroaded the players because that's all I knew.<br/><br/>So, I don't want to do that since it's 2011 and I've been playing Indie games for years.  I still want to run an old-school game full of adventure, but how do you do that and still maintain a story without pre-plotting everything?<br/><br/>How I typically prep games is through Bangs and Relationship Maps.  That seems a bit off for an adventure game where players will be going into dungeons.<br/><br/>I suppose I could prep Fronts like Apocalypse World/Dungeon World but I'm not convinced that's the way to go with old-school play.  <br/><br/>What tools techniques do you use to keep an old-school campaign fresh in the long-term and allow players to co-author the story?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332438/#Comment_332438" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T06:39:37+00:00" title="June 30, 2011  6:39AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I think you're closer than you think with R-maps and Bangs.</p>\n<p>The thing that comes to mind is Dogs in the Vineyard's town creation rules.

That means no pre-prepared grandiose campaigns. Active PCs operating in the world drive what happens. That's the old school paradigm. It's not that different to the story-games paradigm. The OSR is much closer by way of example to storygaming than it is to say 1990s style metaplots.<br/><br/>Personally I see absolutely no reason you couldn't use R-Maps, Bangs, Dogs town creation rules (that's a really good idea there). As Ry says you just don't decide what will happen.<br/><br/>The point of old school play is how open it is. The techniques you know and love should work just fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332487/#Comment_332487" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T10:31:35+00:00" title="June 30, 2011 10:31AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Ry and Max, some good advice.  <br/><br/>I haven't seen that Matt Finch book, if you can dig up a link without too much trouble I would definitely appreciate it.<br/><br/>My hang-up with R-Maps/Bangs is that they don't feel very organic when added to a system like D&amp;D.  I would imagine play would be centered around dealing with problems in town and never leave to check out that dungeon over the hills.  Tying a dungeon into the R-Map wouldn't be terribly hard but it would still feel like an aside to the pressure cooker situation that is going on in town.<br/><br/>Also, I haven't had a tremendous amount of success with sandbox play.  Mostly because, in my experience, the group has to be very tightly nit or we have to handwaive the fiction to get everyone together.  It's like trying to play Apocalypse World with 4 people who try to keep inserting themselves in each other's scenes.  I do very much like the idea of sandbox play but it's only really worked for me when the sandbox was secondary to the character's backstory/beliefs and bangs focused on those beliefs were used to drive the story forward.  <br/><br/>I'm kind of looking for a synthesis of R-Map/Bangs, Sandbox, and old-school play and I'm struggling with the right mix.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332501/#Comment_332501" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T11:00:18+00:00" title="June 30, 2011 11:00AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's going to be a problem I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you really want "old school" type play where death is on the line every instant you are in the dungeon and the only way to survive is by smart play it's going to be really tough if you want play to be focused on character backstory/beliefs.  What do you do when some of the characters really driving the story with their issues get killed off in a dungeon due to bad dice rolls or even poor decisions?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you might try doing is creating big setting backstory factions and get your players to tie into those rather than the beliefs of their characters so you can slot in another similar character if one dies off but that kind of lends itself more to preplotting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332507/#Comment_332507" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T11:12:44+00:00" title="June 30, 2011 11:12AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt Finch's thing isn't really a book, but a pamphlet.

Old-school D&amp;D is picaresque, it has a long series of events that aren't necessarily tied together in any larger plot. It's also about money.  <a href="http://grognardia.blogspot.com/2008/10/picaro-and-story-of-d.html" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a Grognardia post about picaresque in D&amp;D and <a href="http://grognardia.blogspot.com/2008/08/locale-and-plot.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> is a post about locale and plot. Zak Smith also wrote some smart things on the matter but his blog is hard to navigate so I can't find the important bits now. <br/><br/>"You're drinking in the tavern, when suddenly you hear screams outside. The goblin horde is attacking the village!"<br/>That's totally a bang in terms of D&amp;D play. The players cannot not do anything about it, whether it's bagging the tavern's profit and running through the back doors or fighting the invaders. I'm simplifying and using a dumb example but there you have it.<br/><br/>R-maps are totally useful in any game. Since D&amp;D is more about exploring dungeons, the wilderness and raiding tombs, you will probably get more mileage out of R-maps of factions, monster groups, cults, curches, kingdoms, dungeon inhabitants etc. rather than direct R-maps of complicated relationships. Do not make D&amp;D about interpersonal drama or emotional story or something like that because it's not about that. That isn't to say it can't spice play up. Dungeon World uses the Apocalypse World inter-player relationships (Hx aka Bonds) that are set up at the start of play. Someone in the party owes you a favour, someone in the party is laughing at you, you really really like someone in the party. That kind of stuff.<br/><br/>I don't see why Fronts wouldn't work. Oldschool D&amp;D is location-based and locations are basically geographically-defined situations. Situations have fronts. Dungeon World has fronts. Maybe not in the direct sense of AW, but still. The orc horde beyond the mountain pass in a Front. Write a couple of questions about it and make a countdown clock for it. The ancient cult at the bottom of the catacombs trying to raise a sleeping demon is a Front. The greedy town official making deals with the drow to replace the mayor is a Front. They threaten resources, law, goodness, stability, justice...<br/><br/>Sandbox works with player-authored goals (Beliefs etc.). I don't really see why it wouldn't. Since in a sandbox campaign the GM is basically just sitting back and acting as a referee/intermediary between world and characters, reacting to their actions ("go wherever, do whatever"), if the players/characters don't have goals or beliefs to act on then they'll just sit around waiting for something to happen...it's really interplay between putting some pressure on the situation through "Fronts" (and kicking things off with a "Bang") and the players setting some long term goals for their characters.<br/><br/>Here are two pretty cool posts by Zak on sandboxing and adventuring: <a href="http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2011/05/method-for-making-d-sandbox.html" rel="nofollow">click</a> and <a href="http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2011/05/every-single-way-i-can-think-of-to.html" rel="nofollow">click</a> </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332521/#Comment_332521" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T11:39:01+00:00" title="June 30, 2011 11:39AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite><a href="http://grognardia.blogspot.com/2008/10/picaro-and-story-of-d.html" rel="nofollow">Here</a>is a Grognardia post about picaresque in D&amp;D andhereis a post about locale and plot. </blockquote>\nIt's kind of interesting how much that first link tends to apply to non-D&amp;D, non-fantasy TSR games of that same era (Top Secret 1e, Boot Hill, Gangbusters, Star Frontiers) and how little the second link, regarding locale and plot, applies to them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332545/#Comment_332545" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T13:19:14+00:00" title="June 30, 2011  1:19PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is interesting!<br/><br/>Another thing to note is how the picaresque theme changes and disappears with time. By default in old-school play whether the PCs would be heroes was a question answered in play, by the time you get to the 4E Red Box the game is telling you your PC should be a hero or you can pack your bags. Also, as Rob Donoghue writes <a href="http://rdonoghue.blogspot.com/2011/04/action-vs-adventure.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, old-school D&amp;D better fits the Adventure genre, while 4e (and anything post 3.x I'd say) is more accustomed to Action.

I mean, I'm as orthodox Forgista as you can get, and I still get pleasantly surprised about how people who have no truck with that scene at all (a distaste, even) will come up and triatribe against premade plots and for cohesive creative agenda (under a different name, but still) like it was 2003 all over again. It's not all like that (I've been disappointed by Frog God Games, for instance, as it's so close to 3rd edition D&amp;D in approach), and some of the writers could stand a slight bit more experience outside the D&amp;D box just to give them a bit of depth, but there's enough of it to make that whole scene quite agreeable to my own play preferences.<br/><br/>Odds are that if you're at home with Forge philosophy, then something akin to my ponderings on how to play D&amp;D might suit you; my basic precept on the topic is that D&amp;D is a gamist fantasy adventure game where a challenge is established essentially by negotiation (the player chooses to open that door in the dungeon, basically) and then resolved in a way that priorizes a sensible fiction over explicit mechanical procedures. <a href="http://isabout.wordpress.com/2007/11/01/challenge-based-adventuring/" rel="nofollow">I wrote about this</a> a few years back as a sort of summation, and have since played along these lines quite a bit to great success (he says after an 8 hour session and a shower). Should really write a book on this just to bring everybody up to date on how to make D&amp;D rock.<br/><br/>And no, I don't find relationship maps particularly exciting in this context, although I could imagine using them with a sufficient basis on other things. More important to provide player freedom, learn to offer challengeful choices when they arise in the fiction, referee a fair game in a trusted environment and lastly, provide a segmented, complex challenge battleground such as a dungeon module or similar. That last point is really the least important, I think, but when present it pretty much does everything a relationship map might do for your game prep.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332551/#Comment_332551" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T13:37:33+00:00" title="June 30, 2011  1:37PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: agony</cite>I'm kind of looking for a synthesis of R-Map/Bangs, Sandbox, and old-school play and I'm struggling with the right mix.</blockquote>\n<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/amagigames/long-knives" rel="nofollow">Here's a tool for you.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332569/#Comment_332569" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T16:52:13+00:00" title="June 30, 2011  4:52PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2011/03/zaks-ez-adventure-making-chart_30.html?zx=4d56848422a159d7" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is Zak's take on relationship maps and D&amp;D <br/><br/>ara                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short" title="Lee_Short"><img alt="Lee_Short" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short">Lee_Short</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332580/#Comment_332580" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T18:10:02+00:00" title="June 30, 2011  6:10PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 30, 2011 6:15PM by Lee_Short.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's something I've done a couple of times, and it's worked for me.

Yet the GM has free rein to interpret things however he'd like, and the players have no control over the details.  Old school enough for me.  <br/><br/>I've found that the following workflow works pretty well: players rough out their characters, then they do the exercise, then they detail their characters while the GM roughs out an adventure based on their leads, then the adventure begins.<br/><br/>*No duplication allowed until the very last item (which must be a duplicate).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332586/#Comment_332586" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T18:34:25+00:00" title="June 30, 2011  6:34PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing I do is ask lots of questions that give the players a hand in creating the world.

That should be your Quest, since you get XP for it."<br/>\n* Adventure! in setting that's been changed by the player's choices; like a spiderweb, touching one strand will send shivers throughout the whole<br/>\n* Repeat until in-game time threshold is met<br/>\n* Progress powerful NPC organizations as in-game time passes<br/>\n* Repeat until the PCs meet their player-defined Goals and pass to paragon tier/name level<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some of the hack's changes:<br/>\n<br/>\n* I threw down organizations with goals on the map.  These organizations ("Lairs") do things and get more powerful over time.<br/>\n* When the PCs spend money in town, their connection to the town grows.  Some classes can increase their connection when they refresh their daily powers; other classes weaken the connection (Wizards, Warlocks).<br/>\n* When PCs deal with threats, gain levels, hire hirelings, and spend time in town their influence over the town grows.<br/>\n* When PCs spend money in town, the town grows.<br/>\n* When the town grows the PCs gain access to better equipment, better henchmen, and better hirelings.  The town also learns how to defend itself.  After a certain point the PCs have to set up trade with other towns or clear hexes and form new towns in order to keep the town growing.<br/>\n* When the PCs return to town to rest, they have to engage with the townspeople; this gives me the chance to show the consequences of the PC's actions in the setting.  eg. Martial classes have to carouse; an NPC might seek out a PC to buy him/her a drink, saying "Now that the east road is free of gnolls I can get my grain out without having to pay for extra strongarms!  You've saved me!"<br/>\n* PCs are created with Goals that give them XP; these Goals determine what a PC needs to do in order to level up (train, research, gather followers, etc.) as well as the benefits for hitting Paragon Tier (the Paragon Path).  In order to reach Paragon Tier ("Name Level"), the Goal must be met.<br/>\n* I brought back the wandering monster, slow healing, and training times and costs.  That combined with active NPCs ("Lairs") means time is valuable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332670/#Comment_332670" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T08:07:35+00:00" title="July  1, 2011  8:07AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ogremarco</cite>One thing I do is ask lots of questions that give the players a hand in creating the world.
