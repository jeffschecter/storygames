I wouldn't look at your game twice if it were about Lemmings, but if it were about manipulating the stock market so that other CEOs commit suicide, that definitely has my interest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard" title="EpistolaryRichard"><img alt="EpistolaryRichard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard">EpistolaryRichard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379181/#Comment_379181" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-21T16:48:42+00:00" title="May 21, 2012  4:48PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess you'd have to understand the current economic crisis before you could write a proper game about it. I mean, is there anyone who actually does understand what's happening at the moment? I keep a vague eye on these things and am convinced that it's inevitable that Grexit will occur and inevitable that it won't. 8S<br/><br/>You could maybe do a game about the subprime crisis, we've got a pretty good handle on that now. Probably as a larp. You'd need quite a few players though because you need competition in every part of the process and there are about five parts, so you'd need between 10 to 15 teams of people. I can't imagine it being much fun, though. Maybe it could be an educational exercise in how to build a system that will ultimately destroy itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
