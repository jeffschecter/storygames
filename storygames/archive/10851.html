Most of the traditional gamers make every session, and usually ask us to extend the events. The traditional games also seem to attract more women and younger people.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is likely not controversial. But it does mean we will look to include more traditional games in the future to see how that effects things.

This is a great thing! I haven\u2019t seen any distinction here between traditional and indie. And this has never happened to my knowledge mid-season.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Many traditional games attract women, younger players, and non-whites here. Maybe because some traditional games are closer to video games? Are more known? Marketing? Next week is our last session of season 10. I\u2019m going to ask the organizer to put together a questionnaire and I will try to interview a few people personally.<br/>\n<br/>\n- I\u2019ve spoken to most of the dropouts. It\u2019s usually because of scheduling, work, or other unexpected social events. But many of the traditional gamers are also very busy but seem uncomfortable canceling events. We\u2019ve had 2 traditional gamer couples change the dates of their honeymoons based on our events. Where some indie gamers will cancel a game to see a new movie.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Many of the traditional games will have a character creation session before the official season starts.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Many traditional games with advancement will have more chatter online inbetween games. They also tend to be more team based games. That said, Burning Wheel definitely also has this going for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Many indie gamers we attract are from online who spend a lot of time on forums.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Many traditional gamers we attract are from word of mouth and don\u2019t seem to spend a lot of time on forums.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake the above with a grain of salt. These opinions are based on experience but I\u2019m sure I\u2019m missing many factors.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_240636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240636/#Comment_240636" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-05T15:41:56+00:00" title="November  5, 2009  3:41PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite><br>- Many indie gamers we attract are from online who spend a lot of time on forums.</br></blockquote>\nThis kind of person cannot be trusted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240640/#Comment_240640" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-05T15:46:17+00:00" title="November  5, 2009  3:46PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite><br>- Many indie gamers we attract are from online who spend a lot of time on forums.</br></blockquote>\nThis kind of person cannot be trusted.Indeed they cannot...will not!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_240644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240644/#Comment_240644" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-05T15:53:44+00:00" title="November  5, 2009  3:53PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's possible that indie gamers are just more spoiled.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240645/#Comment_240645" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-05T16:01:55+00:00" title="November  5, 2009  4:01PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Of course, let's not forget that many (most?) people drawn to the indie scene have done so at least in part because they no longer had the time to put in to their hardcore trad game experiences, and thus grew dissatisfied with them.

It's not that they're busier, it's that they don't fit gaming into that busy schedule.

There are a lot of things in my life more important than roleplaying and those only increase as I get older.  Sure, hanging out with friends and playing a game is a commitment, but so is hanging out with friends to go to a movie or play poker.  More and more, I'm seeing "hanging out and doing things" as the core activity, with roleplaying merely being one of a number of options, not something that trumps other things and demands a much higher commitment than other activities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_240739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240739/#Comment_240739" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-06T09:23:11+00:00" title="November  6, 2009  9:23AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This strikes me as yet another indication that there are many parallel activities all called "roleplaying" that are all actually quite different from each other.<br/><br/>Are trad gamers "more committed"? I think their version of the activity is defined by long-term commitment. There's the play structure of the "campaign" already baked in, and there's a lot of cultural momentum there as well. Trad gamers who get into short-form story games are <i>probably</i> more committed to long-form play and a steady play schedule than players who were brought up on one-offs. Our Thu Crew is largely comprised of trad gamers, and our schedule is nearly unbreakable.<br/><br/>I imagine it's a little like comparing the play styles of people who play board games like Cranium to the play styles of people who play board games like Advanced Civilization.

In fact, it's about the inverse of what I'm interested in. I actually feel serious misgivings when  I hear suggestions of joining any sort of on-going, open-ended RPGing/S-Ging. One-day, on-off events, howvere, I'm dead keen on, whether hosting or playing in.<br/><br/>I wonder how common that is. I also wonder how that plays into the whole commitment concept, and what options it means are not being covered by design, and what could be covered by design.<br/><br/>I mean, what could deisgn be like if the environment wasn't one where a one-night, two hour session was assumed to be a tasting, but was considered to be something complete in itself?<br/><br/>I guess that, for myself, I find still that the idea in RPGs that you <b>could </b>come back and continue things, however you left off, to be pretty cool.<br/><br/>I'm finding that the idea that, in order to have Real Fun, you <b>must </b>come back again to play to be pretty wanky.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241093/#Comment_241093" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-09T12:48:34+00:00" title="November  9, 2009 12:48PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>0e Supports long-term play, for sure.

The old minis players were the people who bought the first thousand copies of D+D and had played the hell out of it in 74-75. My brothers and I came in just as they were losing interest in it an returning to the other games they played (Historical Minis and board games). The initial idea may have been to run people up to warlord level but I didn't see that happen in actual play. So D+D didn't lend itself to wargame campaign play in the long run even if that was the idea Gary and Dave had. I was in that wave of teenagers that played in 77-78. Minis were always used by everyone I knew but not in a miniatures gamer way (no terrain - instead we drew maps). I gravitated toward miniatures more from the other games we played at the club than because of D+D. What I really appreciate from my early experiences is that we played all the games. There was no mono culture. It is that diversity that spurred more interest in new design than role playing itself.<br/><br/>I'm with Komrade Bob on life circumstances dictating what I play. The thought of a rigidly regular game night just doesn't fit my lifestyle now. Which is why I've gravitated towards board games. They give a clean one shot replayable experience that doesn't take long and looks real pretty. Minis can give that but it takes a lot more work to achieve it.<br/><br/>Maybe committment comes from having to work harder. I don't know... A lot of traditional gamers stop gaming when they find girl friends. Games versus sex... Games almost always lose this match up!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tavis" title="Tavis"><img alt="Tavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tavis">Tavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241270/#Comment_241270" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-10T11:58:32+00:00" title="November 10, 2009 11:58AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 10, 2009 12:02PM by Tavis.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://redbox.wikidot.com/" rel="nofollow">New York Red Box</a> group that I'm part of has two old-school D&amp;D; campaigns (mine is 1974 0E, the other is 1983 Basic) that run on a drop-in model inspired by Ben Robbins' <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/78/grand-experiments-west-marches/" rel="nofollow">West Marches</a>. We're if not parasitic then at least rooted in the larger nerdNYC organizing effort - I learned about the group while reading the nerdNYC forums, and gained players from running OD&amp;D; games at the nerdNYC gameday Recess - but also have our own outreach efforts (we play in a public space and recently made up <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://muleabides.wordpress.com/2009/10/29/sign-of-the-green-goat/" rel="nofollow">business cards</a> so that people drawn by the archaic books and funny dice didn't just get a scrap of paper on which we'd scrawled our URL).<br/>\n<br/>\nSome data about retention with a whoever-shows-up traditional game (although I'm a big proponent of the similarities between certain kinds of old-school and indie play, as whiteknife suggests) can be extracted from <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0An7IQrnAKr7rclJDMDlNWjNFd3FobzE1STZTaFIxYXc&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">this experience point spreadsheet</a> and <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://muleabides.wordpress.com/2009/10/09/a-picture-is-worth-1000-exp/" rel="nofollow">its exegesis</a>. It looks bimodal to me - we're about evenly distributed between people who get hooked and keep coming back, and those who try it out once and move on. The latter group is probably split between friends-of-gamers who are enticed to try out this roleplaying thing, and experienced, often indie, gamers who find it not to their tastes. (If I had to guess why, I'd say it's the big groups, often a dozen people, that emerge from the intersection of public-access and attempt-to-recreate-historical-conditions &amp; which create their own disadvantages and constraints on play.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241708/#Comment_241708" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-12T13:31:11+00:00" title="November 12, 2009  1:31PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I finish a session of a one-shot, my players go, "That was cool!
