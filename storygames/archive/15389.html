One which thinks that killing is usually the best approach? <br/><br/>Personally, I think that a cold, unpredictable killer would make a very interesting addition to an AW game - - it would also give you an opportunity to ask, "WHY are you killing them?" Not in terms of "tut tut, how could you?" but in terms of "what are you trying to ACCOMPLISH by throwing death around like candy?"<br/><br/>For my game's Gunlugger, the go-to question was, "OK, so you point your gun at them. Are you actually planning on shooting them?" The answer to that question helps distinguish Going Aggro vs. Seduce or Manipulate, at the very least, but it also helps to get the player thinking, "Shit, what's my next step?" It's important to not stand in the way of the player doing whatever she is interested in, including "solving" problems however she wishes. Remember to look through crosshairs at NPCs, and remember to cackle at the awesome arterial spray once in a while. Carnage can be fun, even if we're also really interested in seeing how this fragile, dysfunctional web of relationships works.<br/>Even if you end up with a grunting, blood-crazed killer with not a care for anyone in the world, remember this: if you got no friends, you gotta find your own food. You got no friends, you got no one else to watch your back while you sleep. Encourage a trigger-happy player to really explore and confront the consequences of their piratical lifestyle - it could turn out to be very interesting indeed, especially in light of Scarcity as our watchword.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rustin" title="Rustin"><img alt="Rustin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rustin">Rustin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349295/#Comment_349295" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-20T15:22:36+00:00" title="November 20, 2011  3:22PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Zac,<br/>\nI suppose the mindset of a first time AW player who picked the "bad ass killer" as a safe bet, wanting to test the system, not familiar with the AW player directed content, or just not comfortable with the flexibility of player contributed content.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Poison'd, the first scene primes the mechanics of the system. (e.g., killer can just go after the assassin right off to test the kill mechanism) Something like that, but with an even narrower focus.<br/>\n<br/>\nThough, I want to emphasize, this is not an issue of judging or preventing the players from doing what they want to do, but to present them with something that brings a dynamic situation where things might tend to black/white thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more concrete the scene idea, the better. (e.g., sick baby* presented).<br/>\n<br/>\n*on a side note, I originally read that as a Stick-baby, and had this image of this golem like baby made of sticks...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chroma" title="Chroma"><img alt="Chroma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/534/n1N2ZVK30JJ00.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chroma">Chroma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349299/#Comment_349299" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-20T16:16:34+00:00" title="November 20, 2011  4:16PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My favourite question for a Gunlugger is "Where do you get your bullets?"  <br><br>Most players I've had tend to set themselves up as then exclusively having easy access to bullets in some way... which means everyone who needs ammo for something has to come to the Gunlugger and ask real nice... leads to all kinds of excellent complications.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349300/#Comment_349300" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-20T16:19:36+00:00" title="November 20, 2011  4:19PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Chroma">@Chroma</a>: that bit in the rulebook about "all the gas and all the bullets you need" ... was that from a previous edition?<br>I think exploring access to ammo is interesting, though - - good thinkin'! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chroma" title="Chroma"><img alt="Chroma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/534/n1N2ZVK30JJ00.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chroma">Chroma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349302/#Comment_349302" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-20T16:24:08+00:00" title="November 20, 2011  4:24PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Virginia</cite><a href="/forums/profile/Chroma">@Chroma</a>: that bit in the rulebook about "all the gas and all the bullets you need" ... was that from a previous edition?<br>I think exploring access to ammo is interesting, though - - good thinkin'! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></br></blockquote>\nThat's from the Chopper's intro text, I believe... don't mean it's true if the Chopper ain't there..  *laugh*  And maybe the Chopper don't need bullets, her machete is enough...<br><br>If both the Gunlugger and Chopper have access to their own ammo... that is a cubic f&amp;ckton of possible triangles there!

I've seen Apocalypse World occasionally go into too much... well, if I can say this in a non-incendiary fashion, into a too "traditional" style of play. Players and characters angle themselves to gain experience and advance, and to collect weapons and power, like in a D&amp;D game. <br/><br/>That spoils it sometimes, for me. I think the provocative questions are the "killer app" that's needed to take the game out of that mode sometimes, particularly for a character like the Gunlugger. By default, we have no idea what that character cares about, except for his or her gun collection. So give them a chance to make up something they hope for or care about, something we can then use to build interesting situations around.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349492/#Comment_349492" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-22T14:20:13+00:00" title="November 22, 2011  2:20PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In our recent game, the old, used-up Gunlugger's first scene was a really young member of the Chopper's gang stumbling in and trash talking him in a bar.

Anyway, our gunlugger was hired to protect a hole in the outerwall of the holding while it was being fixed, so he camped outside it, and I had the neighboring tribe whose god was stolen by the holding (bit of a long story there) escort their head priestess to hold them accountable.  Mind you, he wanted to kill her right out, but I made it a bit intimidating by saying that the entire tribe (group large) was there and he would have a heck of a time targeting just her; certainly he could try, he'd just have to face their harm in the seize by force roll, which would have wiped him out first game.  So instead,he tried to parley with her, and ended up indebted.  I suppose the whole point of this story is that sure he should have carte blanc access to the killings when killing is a good idea, but in a story, even the most wild and crazy killers don't murder all the time, and if this guy made it in this harsh world, it's because discretion is the better part of survival, he just doesn't have to use it unless the stakes are super high!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349697/#Comment_349697" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-25T22:41:30+00:00" title="November 25, 2011 10:41PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just got why gunluggers have so many dog names.
