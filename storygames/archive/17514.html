I'm thinking this would probably involve something like catching the character in the act of doing something and immediately blackmailing them... but maybe even that isn't quite as visceral and sudden as an assassination... Can we do even better?<br/><br/><br/>The bite is assassination, the thorough gumming is...<br/><br/>The bite is seducing another person's spouse, the thorough gumming is...<br/><br/>The bite is a revolutionary coup, the thorough gumming is...<br/><br/>The bite is indefinite incarceration ala Guantanamo, the thorough gumming is...<br/><br/>The bite is religious conversion, the thorough gumming is...<br/><br/><br/>Can you think of more?

Assassination: Maybe you don't want PCs to die, or else you don't want to set off a Hamlet chain reaction in a game that is focused on the political process.  Revolutionary coup: maybe the story is about how leaders change rather than <i>get</i> changed.  Religious conversion: There might be a worry that, in context, successful conversion might obstruct a story of two individuals' disparate faiths.<br/><br/>Obviously, you <i>could</i> tell stories that bite in those ways, and those stories would be fun, but they wouldn't necessarily be the stories you wanted to tell.<br/><br/>The other thing is that each of my examples are hard wins.  Sure, there is always wiggle room, but far less so in these situations.  You can't mitigate killing someone or indefinitely incarcerating them, or even adultery.  Once it has happened, the situation has forever changed, with bite.  It might sometimes be more appropriate to step back and take a softer win instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
