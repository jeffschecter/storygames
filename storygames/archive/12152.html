The meeting place, a fishing town, has been burned to the ground by pirates and the item taken amongst the spoils. The vicious slaying of everyone in the town is as much a cause for alarm as the loss of the artefact.<br/><br/>The hermit who lives nearby is attracted by the smoke rising from the town, and arrives at approximately the same time as a pair of travellers (a mystic and an engineer) heading to the Imperial Capital for the wedding. The investigator recognises one of the wanderers as someone who helped save the Chrysanthemum Princess earlier, and an agreement is made to bring the pirates to justice and recover the Key.<br/><br/>The resident pirate leads them to a nearby village where his ship is moored and has to face down a mob who believe his crew are associated with the pirates that laid waste to the neighbouring town. It takes the investigator's authority to calm them down, and they set sail on the trail of the killers.<br/><br/>They find debris from a sunk vessel- probably destroyed with a ram- and see a sail on the horizon. They give chase, and it's only the pirate captain's knowledge of tactics that keeps them from being ambushed by the Pirate Queen Kallisti aboard a captured Imperial warship. After an abortive attempt to steal the vessel from underneath her, in which Kallisti demonstrates her considerable martial arts skill against the mystic, the pirate captain negotiates a truce, and the two crews share a hearty meal and plenty of plum wine overnight. Kallisti is told of the fate of the town, and the value of the Key. She says that of the two other pirate lords, the Blood Soaked Blade is the likeliest to have committed the atrocity, and her vessel attacked a small flotilla of his ships, sinking one, just the night before.<br/><br/>As they set sail, they have to deal with a heavy storm that threatens to flounder their ship, put ashore at an island home to the Order of the Black Monkey, who it becomes clear the 'other associate' has a history with. He tells stories of cannibalism and dark magic, and the crew refuse the Order's hospitality while they make repairs to the ship.<br/><br/>The brave xi\xe1 head towards the Blood Soaked Blade's island fortress, but as they are negotiating a narrow channel their ship is brought to a halt by a chain slung across in front of them. They dispatch one of the Blood Soaked Blade's lesser captains and his crew, capturing a ship with Blade colours that they use to approach the fortress undetected. The 'other associate' uses stealth to infiltrate the fortress, hoping to steal back the Key while his companions assault the fortress as a diversion. He finds the treasure chamber, but the chest containing the Key is not there. He is discovered by the Blood Soaked Blade himself, and in the ensuing fight the Blade is slain. The xi\xe1 takes his head as a trophy, and the pirate captain brandishes it to break the Blade's remaining troops' morale so they can all escape. The engineer slights the fortress on their way out, so it cannot be used by any other corsair.<br/><br/>In a flash of insight, they realise that Kallisti intended to take the Key for herself, and sent them to precisely the wrong Pirate Lord so she could attempt to take it from Qin Pan, third of them. They make the best speed they can into his territory and find Kallisti and Qin Pan fighting aboard her flagship. The chest containing the Key is accidentally dropped overboard. The pirate captain dives after it, leaving the rest of the xi\xe1 to fight Qin Pan after he strikes down Kallisti. In an epic battle that taxes the five warriors to the limit, they find themselves on the brink of defeat when, with his last dice, one of them pushes Qin Pan overboard.<br/><br/>The pirate captain dives deeper than he has ever been before and recovers the chest, but as he desperately tries to surface he sees Qin Pan heading down towards him. With an heroic effort, the pirate captain slays Qin Pan, turning the water red with blood.<br/><br/>In the aftermath, the Key is taken to the Red Imperial Palace in triumph, and the six of them gain much Honour for their efforts. The 'associate' and the pirate captain in particular are singled out for taking the heads of feared Pirate Lords.The pirate captain then declares himself 'Pirate Emperor' and pledges his now much expanded fleet to the service of the Red Empire as a replacement for its suffering navy.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
