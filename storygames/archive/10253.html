One is the fictional ethical system of the characters. The second is the real world ethics of the players. It does no good to confuse them.<br/><br/>However, do they overlap? I think that's the meaty question.<br/><br/>Narrativist players might say that they do. That you're playing games to learn about how the real players feel about things by watching what messages they create through play. But I might play a really immoral character to make a moral point as a player, and that doesn't make me immoral.<br/><br/>When you ask about players who ignore the fictional ethics of their characters' actions, I think it's important to determine if harm bleeds over from the fiction to the real world. <br/><br/>Say we're playing D&amp;D and we slaughter every last one of the damned goblins because they're worth 100 XP each. Maybe in the fiction, they haven't even done anything evil. We just lead our adventurers into the wilderness, find us some goblins, and corral them into railroad cars and send them to the goblin concentration camps for mass gassing. The paladin makes a few of the strong ones dig the graves.<br/><br/>Wait, put that way, it sounds pretty ghastly, doesn't it? I mean, it's ghastly in the fiction, too, right? And what does it say about us as players? <br/><br/>I submit that the answer is "It depends on how we act after we make our characters do those things." Are we disgusted by how we made our PCs act? Do we all understand that what our characters did is genocidal and evil? Did we play this session with an impressionable 10-year-old kid who now thinks it's okay and cool to round up folks and slaughter them because they're different?<br/><br/>But that's not how it happens in D&amp;D, is it? The in-game ethical system is different. It sets up Good and Evil as a simplified system of moral absolutes. Most often, those Evil creatures are doing terrible things to Good people. They won't stop. You have to kill them. And it's Okay to kill them in this world. It's expected. And you're fighting them\xa0<i>mano a mano</i>\xa0, not rounding them up in camps -- because that is an obvious reference to something in our shared, real world ethical system that we all know is evil. To make that analogy in the game would be pretty harsh. If we were the victims of Vikings, perhaps, then playing D&amp;D the normal way might really seem evil to us.<br/><br/>Really, no one plays D&amp;D and then becomes a crazy racist genocidal motherfucker. Those people were that way before they started playing D&amp;D and they brought their personal ethical systems with them into play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227905/#Comment_227905" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-26T11:24:02+00:00" title="August 26, 2009 11:24AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The ethical dimension is always present, even if it's not salient.

If my table of friends agree that we want to go in the dungeon, kill the goblins, and take their stuff, then I see nothing wrong with that partially because those are the rules of the game. Adding considerations about goblin children (if you are inclined) is a fine way to play, but it isn't better, or more correct. The rules of D&amp;D don't consider goblin children. Monopoly could have a moral consideration if since part of the game is to bankrupt the other players. In the real world, this is seen as an unethical, but Monopoly is a game; like D&amp;D it is pretend. It doesn't make you morally bankrupt as a person to slaughter goblins who have done you no harm. Goblins are evil in D&amp;D. That's the pretend.<br/><br/>Graham made an excellent point about not making it a moral imperative.<br/><br/>Here's a question to consider: do you view the lack of moral considerations in game as problematic?

One is general: do I disapprove of tables where that happens? No. I don't have any skin in that game. Badwrongfun is still fun for some people.

At my table, it's generally pretty relevant, because the group I play with tends to enjoy the drama of hard choices. Some of the same people play a pawn-ish 4e game every week and generally don't let it bother them. Reasonable adults can disagree about how interesting it is to talk about ethics.

And I suppose you could even argue that if the only person who was being "hurt" was the masturbatory power fantasist, then it's still a matter of choice, albeit a foolish one. On the other hand, to the extent that RPGs are associated with the puerile, it makes it harder for the rest of us to be taken seriously. It's like science fiction or comic books: they used to be trash, now they're culture--but it was an uphill battle. Or that story Jason Morningstar told about the conversation overheard in the bookstore: [Kid picks up book]. "Mommy, what's D&amp;D?" "It's a game. Some people used to get . . . obsessed with it." [Kid puts down book]. Of course, you have to be careful about making aesthetic judgments about the worth of others' play, or they'll accuse you of a kind of puritanical fascism and revel in their transgressive embrace of badwrongfun. But fuck them too. -- Bill                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228036/#Comment_228036" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-26T19:25:06+00:00" title="August 26, 2009  7:25PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>I think one could make a very persuasive argument that masturbatory power fantasies, particularly engaged via a medium unique in its power to blur the line between audience, creator and creation, are not only not-okay, but actively bad for the participant.</blockquote>\nOn the other hand, maybe they're like the ultraviolent murals the super-chill aliens in <i>Quozl</i> ( Alan Dean Foster) meditiate on to help themselves be, y'know, super-chill...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Burr" title="Burr"><img alt="Burr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Burr">Burr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228041/#Comment_228041" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-26T20:10:17+00:00" title="August 26, 2009  8:10PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So wait, does this mean Step On Up should be called Masturbatory Power Fantasy now?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
