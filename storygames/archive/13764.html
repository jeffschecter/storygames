Sometimes it goes simply unnoticed, sometimes it gets dismissed as bad writing without any indicator given of what makes it bad. Game fiction gets casually (habitually?) dismissed as tripe.<br/><br/>I think there's thoughtful work put into a lot of game writing that goes unappreciated or unsung. Am I wrong? <br/><br/>This isn't about the rules, it's about the language\u2014from the language of rules to the voice of fiction\u2014that you love in your favorite game books. Go as far back into your library as you like or tell us what's great about your current favorite game. Help me understand what it is that you like about the way this game was written or the way that game was voiced. Do you think more games should do things the same way or are you talking about a lightning strike?<br/><br/>Specific examples ("Cyberpunk 2020's text helped me find my character's voice in a nanosecond; it had me talking like that game for a year!") preferred, but general likes ("I prefer games to feel like artifacts from the world where they're set") are welcome, too.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311510/#Comment_311510" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-07T12:17:39+00:00" title="February  7, 2011 12:17PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, I love love <i>love </i>the way The Fantasy Trip: In the Labyrinth is written.

I never got around to commenting on <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/index.php?topic=30188.0" rel="nofollow">this</a> thread, (I really should - I have a lot of thoughts on it), but check out the *world* that's birthed by that brief combat description from Melee/Wizard.<br/><br/>Another +1 on Paranoia, both  for humor and for text that gets players on board for a setting which has very few cultural touchstones relative to a lot of the other role-playing games we enjoy.  I've purged my RPG collection three times and haven't dropped a single Paranoia book.<br/><br/>I can echo Will's example of Cyberpunk 2020 and 2013, (whether or not he feels that way himself).  Most of its supplements as well.  Maybe there's a filter of nostalgia but those rulebooks influenced the way me and some of my closest friends talked to each other and thought about role-playing for almost *three years*.  I attribute my shift from caring about a character's mechanical proficiency/effectiveness to their style/narrative potency almost entirely to those books and the way they were written.<br/><br/>There are several people in this community who've disparaged rulebooks with lots of fiction.  I mostly agree.  But a little is totally fine with me.  And flavor your rules descriptions with the essence of the world you're introducing to us?  I'm yours, provided that world intrigues me.  Sometimes it makes the book less useful as a rules reference, but it need not.  Dry tomes that are perfect reference books are a significantly greater obstacle to me ever purchasing your game, much less getting it to the table than books with "too much fiction."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mjbauer" title="mjbauer"><img alt="mjbauer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/222/nPG4NFOY76VNT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mjbauer">mjbauer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311585/#Comment_311585" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-07T22:10:16+00:00" title="February  7, 2011 10:10PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the few RPG texts that I remember really enjoying for its literary merit alone is John Harper's <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/mustang/" rel="nofollow">The Mustang.</a> The text is packed with style and substance that is astonishingly cohesive (in my opinion).

It all fits and immediatedly (for me anyway) immerses me the game, however uncomfortable that may seem.<br/>\n<br/>\nLuke Crane is another conversationalist, almost in a 'grandmaster of fantasy' sorta way. Like when your big brother showed you how to play D&amp;D. (I was that big older brother!) His adventure burner specifically drums into you, almost like a pep talk, the tried and true ways of making your game sing. So listen up damnit!<br/>\n<br/>\nthe original AD&amp;D for Gygax's sheer enthusiasm for this badly edited game that mixed tactical miniature wargames and fantasy stories into this odd collection of mechanical miniuatea. I still really enjoy reading the introduction and preface to the players handbook. "this world is not complete, it needs organisers and adventurers to explore it. It needs YOU.' Awesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nInspectres has a great immersive text too, along the lines of Fiasco, is well written and to the point, with great graphical overlay.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really liked the way Elfquest used excerpts from the comics to highlight the narrative situations that required implementation of the (runequest) rules. More rules should use comics, both as additional illustration for 'examples of play' (like in the Original Changeling) and to explain the rules too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311587/#Comment_311587" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-07T23:11:05+00:00" title="February  7, 2011 11:11PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lisa Padol</cite>Anything by John Tynes, I think.

He's very clearly an incredibly good technical writer, and he would make George Orwell proud (for any of you who haven't read his Politics and the English Language, I highly recommend it). Laws' has a very direct writing style, he says what needs to be said and no more. This makes it actually somewhat harder to read all the way through than other texts, but it also means that the lower page count has a lot more content than you would expect. His writing style isn't enjoyable to read, in the same fashion as David Pulver's Transhuman Space, Technomancer or Centauri Knights - all of which richly describe the setting and the history of the game world - but his purpose is clearly to convey technical information, and I think he does it better than anyone else.<br/><br/>HeroQuest 2e stands out as much for the way in which it is written as it does for the quite innovative approach to character generation and narration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Linnaeus" title="Linnaeus"><img alt="Linnaeus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://home.rushcomm.ca/~gcam/Guernica Bull.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313399/#Comment_313399" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-19T19:22:40+00:00" title="February 19, 2011  7:22PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll throw Misspent Youth into the ring as my current favourite.

The game is easy enough to remember that I'm pretty sure I can run it from them most of the time, and this way I don't have to flip back and forth through the book (or print them all out) to use them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dreampunk" title="dreampunk"><img alt="dreampunk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://a0.twimg.com/profile_images/706309938/The-Stork-Avatar_bigger.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dreampunk">dreampunk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313431/#Comment_313431" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-20T10:43:23+00:00" title="February 20, 2011 10:43AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love how the shattered mind set of Lacuna spills into the rules and graphic design of the "manual." Before running it, I read it over and over until I could sustain a high functioning paranoid freak out state which I then projected into the game. There's almost a sense that there is a danger inherent in even playing the game, a J-Horror mind virus reconstituted from a hard drive someone had tried to destroy with a jackhammer.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe presentation of the Shab-Al-Hiri Roach also comes to mind. A gradual escalation of whimsical dread pervades the book and directly informs the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GregPogor" title="GregPogor"><img alt="GregPogor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_e5387V2_bKU/TVEgYJ8ZWtI/AAAAAAAAAcw/CFb4Akfg5SE/avatar_storygame_small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GregPogor">GregPogor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313485/#Comment_313485" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-21T01:17:38+00:00" title="February 21, 2011  1:17AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I forgot <b>Dogs in the Vineyard</b>.
