I realize it's Gencon soon (like, SUPER-DUPER soon), and everyone's pretty little heads will be filled with fanciful visions of new and amazing things. I also know that some people out there have purchased my game-in-playtest, <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=63117" rel="nofollow">Spectre of the Beast</a>. (&lt;--available for two bucks in PDF on RPGNow, &lt;i&gt;or whisper me for a $5 print copy by mail--1 buck shipping.)<br/><br/>If any of you fine Spectre-buyers have <i>read</i> it yet--I'd love to hear about it! If you've even played it, I'd DOUBLE-Love to hear about it! And if you also count yourself among this year's merry GenCon band, I'd be super-grateful if you'd jot down a couple thoughts before your brain is lulled by whatever this year's "Chombie" is.<br/><br/>If anyone NEW is interested in Spectre (it's a game about the role of bloodshed in civilization's progress; you play pivotal ambitious people in a made-up history and your ends and means have reverberating consequences), the means to get it is above you. That'd be awesome! Here's a <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=28390.0" rel="nofollow">play report from Go Play NW</a> where I dissect the game's processes a bit (that thread also exists on Storygames, but I tightened it up for a Forge posting).<br/><br/>And if you haven't yet read Spectre, let me know when you do! (&lt;--note the optimism!) If you're off to the con and haven't read it yet, then please just remember me fondly when you come down from the Gencon high.<br/><br/>Spectre of the Beast is waiting.<br/><br/>peace,<br/>-Joel                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
