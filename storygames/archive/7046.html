This is the state's only gaming convention, but has been growing since it began two years ago. This year's theme is horror, so the organizers are looking for anyone willing to run horror games or designers looking to promote games at the events. <br/><br/>If anyone is interested, drop me a PM and I can get you contact information. You also can visit the boards at www.charcon.org which we are trying to grow. If you can have someone demoing or selling your game at the event, I would be more than happy to include that in any CharCon articles I write for the newspaper, or to do an interview to post on the site. <br/><br/>If you have any questions, feel free to respond here or at the CharCon site and I can hook you up with whatever you need. As an aside, I don't work for CharCon, but have become friends with the guys who organize the event and am all about anything I can do as a journalist and game geek to support the hobby in West Virginia. We're a bit of an untapped market, so this would be a good chance to get a few new eyes on these kinds of games. Though the theme this year is horror, any kind of game is welcome and wanted.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>ME                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lor%20the%20Swede" title="Lor the Swede"><img alt="Lor the Swede" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lor%20the%20Swede">Lor the Swede</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171715/#Comment_171715" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-27T21:03:55+00:00" title="September 27, 2008  9:03PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I plan on running a session of The Mountain Witch at CharCon.

CharCon is in less than a week. If you are in the Charleston, W.Va. area, please stop by. We are expecting about 500 participants, and there will be a few indy games there, which will be cool.
