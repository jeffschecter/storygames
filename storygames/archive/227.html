                    Bruce's thread <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=225&amp;page=1#Item_5" rel="nofollow">over here</a> prompts me to ask who you are, outside of <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/about/jason.php" rel="nofollow">gaming</a>.  I'm particularly interested in the demographic here - I know some of you folks in real life, some of you virtually, some of you by reputation, and some of you not at all.  I'll start, and I hope those of you with the inclination will introduce yourself.<br/><br/>I'm Jason Morningstar.  I'm 38.  I grew up in Michigan and spent a lot of time in Alaska.  I was a theater major in college and once wrestled a guy for a mule deer skull in Dolores, Colorado.  I'm married to an awesome librarian.  I work for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  We live in magnificent Durham!  Step off, haters!  My wife and I both really enjoy travel, particularly to teh Europe, and we're suckers for the weird, tragic, and trashy.                </div>

                            Oh, I love these! I get to endlessly reintroduce myself! <br/><br/>I'm Brand, I'm a 31 year old American ex-pat living in Toronto Canada. Right now I'm writing and doing freelance design/writing work to support myself (about half of it in the game industry, about half of it outside Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and let me tell you lawyers pay better than gamers do) until the Ontario College of Teachers decides that my California Teachers Credential is or is not good enough to let me teach here. When I do teach I'm an elementary school teacher, and used to teach 3rd grade after years and years of sub teaching. <br/><br/>Other than that, I have an MA in Composition and Rhetoric, and a fascination with history, religion, and literature that leads me to consuming vast quantities of books. I often go through obsession phases in which I will learn everything about a specific time, place, or religion -- I've had years long obsessions with Celts, India (including Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism), the wars of the 17th century, central African tribal politics, and hosts of other junk that don't help at all in real life but that make for fascinating game material. <br/><br/>I'm married to a lovely Mo who is a business analyst for Bell Canada and just happens to have published in half a dozen RPG books of her own. We have no children, and are unlikely to do so at any time in the near future.<br/><br/>Edit: Oh, I'm Mormon -- if anyone cares. Mo is self-defined non-dualist who believes in a recycle theory of the non-soul. I've also been playing RPGs since I was 5. I add these things because everyone else is now talking about religion and stuff and so I thought I should add it in.                        </div>

<p>I'm Tony Lower-Basch.  I'm 35.  I, too, grew up in Michigan.  Didn't spend much time in Alaska, though.</p>
<p>I'm married to a research analyst who keeps the entire family afloat (she rocks!) while I do many of the non-money things, including raising our two sons.  This lets me do lots of little things for little money, like design games, teach jujitsu, and run the only baby-video editing company I know of that does house calls (thank you world of ever-more-portable computing!)</p>
<p>I am totally, totally addicted to anime and manga.  **But*, I think that most of what people consider "the genre of anime" is, rather, a near-bottom-of-the-barrel collection of pablum that's stupid enough and immature enough to be sold to violence-hungry US male pre-teens.  That's sad.  There's so much other good stuff out there:  like <a href="http://www.advfilms.com/favorites/princessnine/" rel="nofollow">Princess Nine</a> and <a href="http://www.tokyopop.com/dbpage.php?propertycode=KKO&amp;categorycode=BMG" rel="nofollow">Kare Kano</a> and <a href="http://www.advfilms.com/titles/azumanga/" rel="nofollow">Azumanga Daioh</a>.  And that's just a few samples in my particular favorite sub-genre, high-school stories.</p>

I grew up in a scattering of the suburbs between Chicago and Boston.<br/>

As far as gaming is concerned, I think the best phrase would be "checkered past".  If it's old-school, I've probably played it at least a few times, as I drifted in and out of gaming groups for the past twenty-five years.                        </div>

I grew up in small-town Alberta, in Canada, and have lived in quite a lot of places in this country.  I'm twice-married, twice-divorced, and live with my current girlfriend.  Some people are "agnostic-Christian", and by that standard I'm "agnostic-Buddhist"; I was raised Christian and that ended at Bible College.<br/>
<br/>
I'm a landlord for an apartment building in arguably the worst neighborhood in my city (Edmonton).  I don't really get vacations, or travel, these days.  I do go out dancing at a local nightclub about once a week.                        </div>

<br/>
Getting my masters degree in Library Science (with a paper that I should be writing right now) and working at a university library.  I live with my lady-friend, Janaki, who is pretty neat.<br/>

When not gaming I play soccer and avoid gluten and podcast (talk about gaming with Jeff) and write.  I post under the name, Paka, on other boards and it is kind of refreshing to sign in as Judd here.  <br/>

I live in Milwaukee, which sucks, but I'm finally finishing that English degree I slacked on many years ago. Once upon a time I wrote for a living, but it wasn't fun stuff. Probably I'll give it another shot when school's done. Right now I'm focusing on creative writing, after having writer's block for 15 years. I think I'll be trying to publish some stories soon.<br/>

                            Ha ha!  I'm younger than everyone here so far!  I'm James Schmitz, 29, a law student in Manhattan. NYC is fun but stupid-expensive!!!  I eventually want to go into international human rights law.  Don't get me started on Gitmo and Abu Ghraib.<br/>
<br/>
I speak a little bit of German, and I'm learning Mandarin, French, and Spanish.  Before I started law school, I took 2 years worth of martial arts, and would dearly love to continue.<br/>
<br/>
In a month I'll be moving in with my girlfriend.  Her dad is very sick, and probably unemployable.  I'm not sure how we'll be doing come 2007.  But things are tolerable right now.<br/>
<br/>
My "traditional" gaming career ended in 1991, when my character did a bellyflop onto a minotaur's head.  I ran a proto-Narrativist science-fiction campaign for a few years.  These days I'm looking forward to playing "The Shadow of Yesterday," "Sorcerer," and "Primetime Adventures."  I'm gradually putting together a Real-Life Group.                        </div>

                            I'm <a href="http://adam.legendary.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Adam Dray</a>, 36, and a resident of Owings Mills, one of the suburbs of Baltimore, Maryland. I grew up in northeastern Ohio, did a college stint at Case Western Reserve U and Kent State. I do computery things for money. For the last 8 years, I've been at PHH Arval, a corporate fleet management company. I'm an Enterprise Architect there. That means I develop strategy for our information technology department and participate as a designer for projects. <br/><br/>I'm married to <a href="http://stephaniedray.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Stephanie</a>, who is trying to write speculative fiction for a living. She's a graduate of Smith College (B.A.), Northwestern (J.D.), and the Clarion Writer's Workshop. She is a licensed lawyer but has the good sense not to practice. On top of all that, she's the most awesome woman in the world. We have a townhome in a quiet, woodsy neighborhood, and two cats: Opie and Mercury.<br/><br/>In our free time, she and I run <a href="http://firan.legendary.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FiranMUX</a>, a text-based online roleplaying game. It's one of the most popular games of its kind and it regularly sees 80-100+ players online at a time. We host an annual con for Firan players and last year's was attended by around 70 people. We wrote and ran a LARP for all of them, too (all pregen characters). Insane but fun.<br/><br/>I don't have a lot of non-gaming hobbies. I just don't have the time for them and I don't manage my free time well. I collect old RPGs. I watch a few choice tv series (Battlestar Galactica, Lost, West Wing, The Sopranos, Rome) and other shows (Daily Show, Colbert Report). I'm somewhat politically active (Young Democrats, Central Baltimore County Democrats, Rapid Response Network). <br/><br/>I like to read when I have time. Currently open: <i>Gödel, Escher, Bach</i> (Hofstadter), <i>A Clash of Kings</i> (Martin), <i>The Art of Leadership</i> (Nahavandl). Recently finished: <i>Rim</i> and <i>Mir</i> (Besher), <i>The Tipping Point</i>, <i>The Apache Cookbook</i> (Coar &amp; Bowen).<br/><br/>I don't like anime or comics, though there are exceptions (I enjoyed Sandman and the Dark Horse Conan series). <br/><br/>I have a <a href="http://adamdray.livejournal.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LiveJournal</a>, where I mostly talk about gaming stuff. I enjoy a bunch of board games and strategy games, a lot of card games, but not many collectible card games (I was a big Magic player for a while though).                        </div>

                            I'm Thor Olavsrud. I'm 30. My father was Norwegian and my mother American. We lived in a suburb of Oslo until I was six, when we moved to the States. I grew up on the Eastern Shore of Maryland and went to college in Great Barrington, Massachussets.<br/>
<br/>
I'm divorced and live in New York City. For many years I was a journalist. I've worked as a staff writer at newspapers, the editor of a newspaper in Connecticut, and a senior editor for an online trade publication covering the technology industry. I spent a lot of the time on point covering the Microsoft antitrust trial and SCO v. IBM. These days I edit market research reports on the tech/online industry (consumer surveys, executive surveys and forecasts on stuff like wireless, Wi-Fi, pc &amp; console games, broadband, personal technology, tv &amp; filmed entertainment, european content &amp; programming, european marketing &amp; advertising, and next-generation marketing).<br/>

                            I'm Ben.<br/>
<br/>
I'm 24 years old, single and not-even-vaguely-thinking of marriage, and for almost three years now I've been essentially itinerant, only staying in one place long enough to finish a few classes, get my degree, and feebly try to get a job.  I've travelled through most of the US (staying with a lot of the people I know from the Forge), and through Germany, Finland, Russia, Mongolia, and China.  (I've also been to Mexico, Canada, France, Switzerland, Italy and Israel, but not on this trip).  I speak Mandarin Chinese, and am right now looking for work and a place to stop and take a fucking breath and put down roots.  I will probably end up somewhere  in China, as that's where I am right now.<br/>
<br/>
I'm originally from Northern California, by which I do not mean San Francisco, but Arcata, a small college town surrounded by redwood trees, ocean, loggers, and pot farmers.  It's an absolutely wonderful place which I have vague plans of settling down in someday.  I lived there basically straight through 'til I went to college.  I went to school on the east coast, got a degree in physics, learned Mandarin, and am now looking for work as an editor, writer, or teacher.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from gaming, my other hobbies are writing, reading (lately: classic novels, particularly Chinese ones), tea, coffee shops, and hiking.  I play a really wide variety of games, ranging from D&amp;D to pervy indie games to poker to bridge to Puerto Rico.  I used to play more videogames, but I haven't done so much since high school.  I essentially missed out on the entire PS2 generation.<br/>
<br/>
I've role-played in a really shocking variety of styles, also.<br/>

                            Jonathan Walton, 23, part-time alpaca farmer, part-time unemployed China dork.  I got my BA in East Asian Studies from Oberlin College and have spent a total of 3 years living in the People's Republic, most recently as a Fulbright Fellow in 2004-2005, when I studied the psuedo-Christian Taiping Rebellion (1851-1864).  I've applied to a bunch of jobs teaching the Chinese language at independent schools across the country.  I'll probably go to grad school eventually.  Not sure in what.<br/><br/>I play the banjo and program little songs on a Gameboy emulator using Little Sound DJ.  I've written one-third of a operetta based on John Milton's <i>Paradise Lost</i>.  I don't read music.  I create comics from photos taken with my ancient digital camera (c. 2001).  My newest project is a kung fu action series called, <i>Splendid Record of the Dharma Hunters</i>, which we plan to start shooting soon.<br/><br/>My favorite musical genres are prog-bluegrass, power metal, opera, and Chinese indie rock.<br/><br/>I currently live in my parent's basement in Raleigh, NC or on the alpaca farm outside of Richmond, VA.  I am currently single and liable to stay that way until I really settle down somewhere.  I drive a 1991 burgandy Plymouth (60,000 mi) that I got for $1000.  I like my beer Belgian and my coffee full of cream and sugar.  I wouldn't trade my life for anyone else's.                        </div>

<p>22 and still the youngest. Verbosity later.</p>
<p><em>Edit:</em><br/>
I grew up in NJ and PA. I hated PA and don't remember hardly any of it, despite having spent two years there.</p>
<p>I like to pretend to be agnostic, but various bits of Hindiusm still strike a chord in me.</p>
<p>I went to JHU, and studied linguistics and fiction writing. As a result, I spent a lot of time arguing with a lot of different kinds of hotheaded-but-clever people and it's coloured my diction noticeably. I still haven't broken myself of the habit of making statements that mislead; I'd like everyone to just take things I say at face value and be careful not to carry assumptions in or make new ones. This is asking too much.</p>
<p>I would like to go to art school and develop my illustration and costume design skills. I use my Livejournal as a ranting post and a food blog.</p>
<p>I used to play D&amp;D and love it, but now I wanna be a cool kid and the cool kids are apparently too cool for D&amp;D. <em>*put out.*</em></p>

                            Hi - I'm Jon Hastings, 28 years old, living in New York City (Astoria to be precise).  I have a BA in Theater from the College of the Holy Cross, and I did the Cinema Studies MA program at NYU.  Currently, I make use of approximately 0% of my academically-gained knowledge at my job as a Labor Relations Guy in the Film Industry (I make sure Teamsters get their meal penalties paid on time and other fun stuff like that).<br/>
<br/>
RPGing is my major hobby, but I'm also into making lists of movies that I like and doing volunteer dog rescue work.  I read quite a bit: mostly detective novels, but I'm not too picky.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in northern New York state (Malone), went to highschool in Montreal, college in Massacusetts, and I've spent the last seven years bouncing back-and-forth between Burlington, VT and New York City.  My girlfriend, Margaret, still lives in Vermont, but she (and Fozzie, our puppy) will be moving down to the city in May.  She is not a "gamer", but she loves beating me at Carcassonne: Castle.<br/>
<br/>
EDITED TO ADD: Oh, yeah: I'm a pretty recent member of/participant in nerdny.com and its Gotham Gaming Guild (both which completely rock!).  I'm also a huge fan of NASCAR and motorsports in general.                        </div>

                            Hi, I'm Mike. 34, happily married with a two year old daughter. She already likes playing with my dice (well, throwing them around the room anyhow).  <br/><br/>I've lived in Wellington, New Zealand all my life. I did a philosophy degree, bummed around a few years, then did a computer science degree and got a real job. <br/><br/>Currently my hobbies are reading, roleplaying games and World of Warcraft. <br/><br/>I'm currently trying to make the move from 'guy really interested in self-publishing a game' to 'guy who has self-published a game'. My game "Badass Space Marines" is set to push me over this line in the next couple of months.<br/><br/>edit to add: if everyone else is pimping their websites then I will as well. I have a <a href="http://gamesteratlarge.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">blog</a> and a <a href="http://genericgames.co.nz" rel="nofollow">games site</a>.                        </div>

                            My turn, my turn!<br/><br/>I'm Josh BishopRoby -- unlike the Other Joshua, I don't mind being Josh or Joshua -- and I live in Whittier, a suburb of Los Angeles.  I work in Woodland Hills, another suburb of Los Angeles, except it's on the <em>other side</em> of Los Angeles.  So my number one hobby in terms of time commitment is commuting.<br/><br/>I'm 28, married, no kids.  I work as an editor at McGraw-Hill, in the Business Education group -- my current big project is a line of Accounting textbooks.  It is exactly as exciting as it sounds.<br/><br/>I was born and raised in Whittier, and spent five or six years up in Santa Barbara for college.  I attended Westmont College, where I gained a BA in English and lost faith in the triune god.  Them's the breaks.<br/><br/>Professionally, I have run a game store, worked at Borders, done HR at a (non-union) Hospital, worked in the Bindery department of a library, worked in the Bindery department of a print shop, taught middle school and high school in the barrio, personally <em>was</em> the publishing department of a non-profit kid's recreation program, and finally washed up at an actual publishing house where I am today.  Oh, and wrote freelance for DP9 and a few other bits and pieces, but never for more than small change.<br/><br/>I'm a foodie -- what we eat for dinner every day most folks would consider profoundly elaborate and fancy; on the other hand, when I get out of the office for lunch, I eat at Taco Bell.                        </div>

                            The timing of this thread is impeccable.<br/><br/>Hi, I'm Nir Shiffer. I'm 24, and for a while there I was worried that I was going to be the youngest one. I was born in Israel and have lived here all my life, altough I've traveled to Germany, England and Kenya on different occasions.<br/><br/>I enlisted in the IDF right out of high school, and spent three years in various operational and training positions in the Artillery Recon array (more then a unit, less then a core). I was discharged honorably at the rank of first seargent, and am currently on active reserve status. I don't like the army very much.<br/><br/>I'm currently studying to become an industrial engineer. It's going pretty well. <br/><br/>I've been hanging on the fringes of this crowd for years now, and this forum is my first time "getting in there", whatever that means. I signed up yesterday, hence good thread-timing.<br/><br/>I keep a <a href="http://shiffer.livejournal.com/" rel="nofollow">Livejournal</a>, which I use for various gaming and non-gaming purposes. I aim to be entertaining. Sometimes I succeed.                        </div>

                            I'm Joshua A.C. Newman. The A.C. stands for Alternating Current.<br/>
<br/>
I'm 32, I live in Florence, Massachusetts with my fiancÃƒÂ©e in a strangely laid out appartment, about 25 minutes from Vincent Baker's house.<br/>
<br/>
I went to school at Hampshire College (with Vincent, lo these many years past) over in Amherst, about 10 miles away, where I studied human/machine interface design, mystical religion, and artificial life (which mesh together surprisingly well).<br/>
<br/>
I'm a <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://joshuanewmandesign.com/" rel="nofollow">graphic and book designer</a> by trade and a <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://glyphpress.com/" rel="nofollow">game designer</a> by love (not that I don't love graphic design). I wrote <i><a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.glyphpress.com/UtB/" rel="nofollow">Under the Bed</a></i> and am currently working on <i><a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://glyphpress.com/shock/" rel="nofollow">Shock: Social Science Fiction</a></i>. As of today, I'm working on a tabletop wargame called Mechaton: Advancer Phalanx, which is a big-ass variant of Vincent's <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=170#4140" rel="nofollow">Mechaton</a>.<br/>
<br/>
My LiveJournal, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://nikotesla.livejournal.com/" rel="nofollow">Monkey Kings Play</a>, is over here. Mostly it's about games, but it's about other things too.<br/>
<br/>
I love to eat —and will be momentarily — Chinese food of several varieties, Korean food, Italian food, Middle-Eastern... wait, I think mostly I like to eat food.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which, I'm going to go eat now.<br/>
<br/>
Edit: I'm really using <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://glyphpress.com/talk/" rel="nofollow">xenoglyph</a> for my blog now, not Lj. Also, I'm now 35 and Shock: has been out since 2006 and is version 1.1. I'm working on Wings of White, Sea of Green, a game about being an awesome pirate captain and Xenon: Alien Science Fiction.                        </div>

                            Hi, I'm Frank Filz, 42 (very soon to be 43). I grew up in Lexington and Concord MA, went to school for 8ish years at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy NY. After college, I moved to North Carolina to take a contracting job with IBM in RTP (and like a good Yankee, I lived in Cary). After 5 years, the finally decided to hire me for real (after shuffling me through a total of 3 contracting agencies, one of which was run by IBM...). In January of 2002, the project I was working on was cancelled and we got 30 days to find a new job. On day 30, I had my final phone interview with a manager in Beaverton OR (Portland) an hour before my exit interview. I also had an offer from a company in Pittsburgh. That afternoon, the manager called with an offer, and gave me 20 minutes to decide. So here I am in Beaverton OR, working in IBM's Linux Technology Center as a networking and NFS developer. I bough a house about a year and a half ago.<br>
<br>
My other hobbies model railroading (this spring, I hope to get started on my garden railroad), LEGO, and reading fantasy and science fiction. My music tastes are pretty wide, but my favorites are progressive rock (especially Yes), organ music, and celtic music.<br>
<br>
I'm a lifelong Unitarian Universalist and am quite involved in church. I am an advisor to the senior high youth group plus several other roles.<br>
<br>
I've done a bit of travelling. As a kid, we used to take a big trip every 4 years or so. I was a bit young to remember much of our first cross country trip, but I definitely remember the 2nd when I was in high school. In 1972, our big trip was to Europe were we bought a VW in Germany, visited Austria, Italy, Belgium, Holland, France, England, Scottland, Yugoslavia, and Romania. Last summer, I accompanied 13 youth and 3 other adults on a pilgrimage trip to Budapest Hungary and Transylvania (where I noted that the last time I was in Romania, our various guides has not even been born yet...). I've been to Canada several times, on one trip, we drove to L'Anse Aux Meadows in Newfoundland over a dirt road (it's probably paved these days), another trip we drove basically to the end of the road on the west bank of the St. Lawrence River, and recently I visited Victoria BC and other places on Vancouver Island.<br>

<br>
I've been gaming fairly steadily since 3rd grade.  Right now I'm in two tabletop campaigns which meet bi-weekly, but we take pretty regular breaks to do different stuff.  Mostly I've just been a player and writer and sponsorer, content to talk up other people's stuff.  I do have two design projects on the burner right now:  One is finishing up my game chef entry "Morpho Londinium" (which has been languishing).  The other is "Queensland", an idea for a game set in the world of Wen Spencer's "A Brother's Price".                        </br></br></div>

                            I'm Keith Senkowski, but Senkowski isn't my real last name.  I was born in Chicago a bit over 28 years ago and now live in the suburbs.  I married into a large Irish family.  I love dogs and some cats.  I hate ferrets.  I like my coffee black, but sometimes will a little cream.  I like to smoke, but am always in some stage of quiting.  I like beer at room temperature.    I hate Goldshlagger and I like bourbon.  I have a BA in Fine Art with enough classes for minors in Theology and Graphic Designs.  I once woke up in a parking lot not knowing how I got there and what had happened over the preceding weekend.  I have worked as a life guard, manager of two concession stands, warehouse monkey at a carpet store, carpet/tile installer, plasma seller, small time dealer, delivery man of warehouse material, landscaper, warehouse equipment installer, warehouse supervisor, graphic designer, web designer/programmer, video editor, cd-rom developer, computer support tech, a referee for a city basketball league and spent one day working for a fast food place.  I once drove to Vermont from Wisconsin and back over a weekend.  I've spent some time in Alaska and Mexico.  I think everyone should go see the Grand Canyon and spend a weekend in Las Vegas during March Madness.  I used to get into fights of various degrees of seriousness, but have since been domesticated.  I like to paint, illustrate, and write a little.  I like to create RPGs cause it lets me do all three to various degrees.                        </div>

                            Hi, I'm Jeff, and I'm 17, which most likely means I'm about a decade younger that you, the Average Story-Games Poster. I made the mistake of wanting an internet pseudonym when I signed up for StarCraft at a tender age of 13 years, and, unfortunately, it's stuck with me, so on all the fora I go by Jeph. The real name is Jeffrey Samuel Schecter.<br>
<br>
I'm another member of the NC crowd, being Raleigh born, Raleigh bred, and a lifetime Raleigh resident. I'm white, male, Jewish (culturally and by birth), and atheist (religiously). No job at the moment, though I do intern at a chemistry lab in Research Triangle Park working with fuel cells for ARO -- closest thing I have to a profession is attending high school. I'm currently a junior, so am tired of people asking me about my plans for college. (If you must know, I'd like to study linguistics and am quite taken with Pomona and Northwestern.)<br/>
<br/>
Aside from gaming, my hobbies include, off and on, novels, yoga, lego, and writing of various sorts. I also enjoy screwing around with Illustrator, and would like to learn how to draw and write a graphic novella some day. 'Cuz being able to draw shit is cool.                        </br></br></div>

My first published RPG was Ember Twilight, which is a very long long story.<br/>
Right now I'm finishing up three of my Ronny games, two of which won awards.<br/>

                            Hi, I'm Arturo GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-Escribano. I'm 35.<br/>
I 'm from Valladolid (Spain). I got my Master and PhD in computer-science at the University of Valladolid, where I'm working nowadays in a kind of tenure-track position. Due to my work, I have also been in Delft (The Netherlands) in many short stays (of some months length each) during the last 10 years.<br/>
<br/>
My girlfriend is also studying computer-science, but at the University of Leon (a city nearby) where my parents also live. She will finish this semester and we will try to live in Valladolid, where I have an apartment.<br/>
<br/>
I like gaming, playing guitar, reading (not only fiction, but history, about architecture, archeology, whatever), and writting.<br/>
<br/>
I begun to play RPGs at the high-school (86). On those times our games were always coming from overseas in original version, far before they were translated to spanish. We were geeks among the geeks. In 96 I got disconnected from the role-playing main-stream. I almost stopped playing in 2000. But in 2005 I discovered The Forge, and all these nice story-oriented people. Now I have organized a group to play indie-games on Tuesday evenings.<br/>
Nowadays I'm finishing preparing my October Ronnies entry (Disaster!) for external playtesting.                        </div>

                            I'm Ben Melhuish (with an optional "S." in front, thus the username). I'm 33 and married, with a two-and-a-half-month child. We live in Shoreline, a suburb of Seattle; I grew up in Portland, and spent several years in the L.A. area, going to school and then living by the beach.<br/><br/>I was introduced to gaming by my third-grade teacher, who was playing in a AD&amp;D/blue-box-D&amp;D hybrid. Before going on hiatus due to Real Life, my gaming group was playing a series of one-shots; prior to that, we played <cite>Nobilis</cite>. I have little interest in actually designing a game, but am very interested in design and theory as it impacts my play.<br/><br/>When not taking care of the boy, I am a professional software geek; more than that, I enjoy cooking (and eating) and mixing cocktails (and drinking them). I'm currently making my way through Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey &amp; Maturin series of books. I have a <a href="http://pile.org/" rel="nofollow">website</a>, which is showing signs of life after years of neglect.                        </div>

                            Moin moin,<br/><br/>I'm Christian Woldmann Griffen. My middle name used to be my last name; I'm German and moved to the US six years ago. When I married my wife, we both took on a new last name that we chose together, because we're egalitarian feminists.<br/><br/>I played TTRPGs from age 13-21, freeform games regularly from 18-26 or so, and now at 28 I'm mainly back to TT gaming. I'm currently designing a couple of games, drafts of some of which you might have seen over at the Forge.<br/><br/>I have <a href="http://chgriffen.livejournal.com/49528.html#cutid1" rel="nofollow">a wonderful wife, a toddler</a>, and two biracial stepkids who don't like to be photographed, an MA in Political Science, and a pays-the-bills job as a Paralegal. Over the past few years I've written and edited my first novel, which I'm about to send to an agent and an editor I met at a writers' conference.<br/><br/>For hobbies, I practice Martial Arts (Wun Hop Kuen Do and Kajukenbo), do geeky computer things (build/overclock my computer), watch select TV shows (most of HBO's lineup plus BSG, Lost, Survivor, 24, Veronica Mars), and spend as much time with my wife as I can.<br/><br/>What else? I'm a leftie, read progressive blogs and write letters to my representatives, sometimes go to the Unitarian Universalist church, used to compose techno songs (that's where the handle is from), and enjoy fart jokes way too much. I get choked up from the right books, movies (e.g., Schindler's List), and operas (Madame Butterfly).<br/><br/>And I probably should leave it at that before we get too far into the realm of the personal <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>- Christian                        </div>

                            Allo, if you haven't hit the user profile thing, I'm a.k.a Tim Kirk, I was born and raised in a small city in Texas that exists as a soul crushing singularity from which people do not seem to permantly escape. <br/>
<br/>
   I've lived elsewhere in Texas (College Station), as well as in Vancouver, BC. <br/>
<br/>
   I'm currently 33 and been playing RPG's in some form since 1981. I've been designing games well, a LONG time, my first feeble attempt when I was 12. (Inspired by Operation Chaos by Poul Anderson,  a magic as technology modern day game which thankfully will never see the light of day.)<br/>
<br/>
   No kids, I play the "good Uncle" to my nephews and neices though entertaining them with RPG's, card games and trying to deter them from to much TV and to much video gaming.  <br/>
<br/>
  Not married and with no plans to ever pursue that path again. (been engaged, multiple times, but it seems not to be. )<br/>
<br/>
   I run games of many sorts and calibers and spend my time working on writing (poetry, games, novels), artwork, and the like, always trying to improve my talents (or lack thereof.)<br/>
<br/>
   I don't watch much TV, spend too much time talking about superheroes, and on the internet.<br/>
<br/>
  Time not spent doing the above I'm usually playing with my white-great dane Cu' Sidhe, whose back talking hard headedness is a great source of joy for me.<br/>
<br/>
Currently I'm working on a fantasy/dark age legend inspired  rpg -High Valor, a western mecha one utilizing a card engine--Vast Frontiers, and others as I've time and will to do so.                        </div>

                            I'm Scott Martin, a 32 year old guy living in a house just north of the trendy center of town* with his girlfriend, Jennifer.  I'm a longtime Fresno, CA native-- I've lived within 30 miles of here since birth, excluding four years of college in southern California.  I'm now a practicing civil engineer at local firm.<br/><br/>I've been gaming since fourth grade.  My father introduced me to gaming, and continues to game with us.  My current group consists of a high school friend, a friend I met a few years ago, <a href="http://www3.flickr.com/photos/toastedwoobie/13365535/" rel="nofollow"> my Dad</a>, <a href="http://www3.flickr.com/photos/toastedwoobie/13364564/" rel="nofollow">my girlfriend and I</a>.  We play RPGs weekly (currently Friday nights) and board games weekly (currently Wednesday nights).  If you want a more complete roleplaying history, I compiled <a href="http://www.scottrpg.com/llamafodder/2006/01/my_roleplaying.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a> a while ago.<br/><br/>Beyond that, I spend way too much time enjoying blogs and forums (like, say, this one).  I use <a href="http://scottrpg.com/llamafodder/" rel="nofollow">a blog</a> for game group coordination, but usually wind up verifying things by phone.  When we moved in together, we almost killed our friends with our books-- Jennifer and I each have large collections.<br/><br/>*: The Trendy Center of Town = The Tower District.

                            I'm John Harper, a 33 year old white male descended from Irish highwaymen (with hearts of gold, one assumes), Cherokee warriors, Arkansas bankers, and, most recently, a Texas preacher.<br/>
<br/>
I live in Seattle, where I work as an art director and graphic designer. I've told them that I would do it for free, but they continue to pay me anyway. My boss is quoted on the back of Primetime Adventures.<br/>
<br/>
I have a tatami-floored apartment in the university disctrict that is one block removed from a quality independent movie theater and/or bar in all four directions -- which makes it the best apartment in the world, according to experts.<br/>
<br/>
I am in a long-term relationship with the lovely and talented Elizabeth, a crime-analyst, therapist, and writer. We are TV junkies, and are not afraid to watch crap. Mocking SCI-FI Channel originals is a favortie pastime. "Oh, Mansquito! When will you learn to love?"<br/>
<br/>
I once played an ex-Navy SEAL in a D.A.R.E. after-school anti-drug movie. I got the part because I had a buzzcut and fit into the wetsuit. My other film and video credits are less well known.<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes teach Aikido, which is one of my favorite things in the world. Some others are: bourbon, Miller's Crossing, Tom Waits, and The Shield. I'm a huge video game junkie -- so much so, that I can't possibly start a list here. Okay, fine: Splinter Cell. Burnout 3. WoW.<br/>
<br/>
That's how I roll.                        </div>

<br>
I'm Thor Hansen<br>
<br>
Born and raised in Toledo, OH sept fr a couple of years out Chicago Way<br>
<br>
Started Gaming in 76 or 77, can't quite put a finger on the exact date;  but in 77 moved from D&amp;D to Traveller and got <br>
Empire of the Petal Throne  Thought EPT was stoopid and threw it in the back of the closet couple years later I went <br>
through the " Buying any game you can find"stage and bought a game called Legacy. This was the first game which led me to realize that I could write game rules.<br>
I went through the D&amp;D ripoff phase and the I need a game with 800 character classes. I self published a game called Tiny Spies which was a fantasy trip ripoff.<br>
<br/>
I have given up gaming two or three times but came back about two years ago and started playing with a group I met on findplay about two weeks ago. (Dogs Rules)<br/>
<br/>
I would still like to write a real game, I'm irreligious (don't believe in much), Married to a much older Woman, Need a real job and appriciate you guys for sharing.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            My full name is the appalling trainwreck "Sydney Joseph Freedberg, Junior," whose only redeeming feature is that it connects me with my late father, a historian of Italian Renaissance painting. Despite the "double y" spelling of "Sydney," I am in fact male.<br/>
<br/>
My father was the son of Latvian Jewish immigrants; my mother is the descendant of a family that hewed its way out of the primeval forest in the piedmont of North Carolina circa 1750, looked around, said, "this looks good," and has remained there ever since, for the last 125+ years as the owners and operators of the local bank -- www.ibankatfnb.com.<br/>
<br/>
I'm an Episcopalian ("Anglican" to those of you not in the US or Scotland). I was born into the church, baptised, wandered off into agnosticism in my adolescence, reentered the Anglican Communion at a Christmas Eve service in 1991, and have struggled to live my faith ever since: "Lord, I believe -- help Thou my unbelief!" My wife and I were married in a 90-minute service with choir, soloist, and a full Mass. It was very cool.<br/>
<br/>
I'm 33, married to a poet with a brewing interest in RPGs but damned little time, and father of a toddler about to turn two, which is the reason for said lack of time. ("My birfday coming. I be two!... My birfday now? Now?").<br/>
<br/>
I am a reporter with National Journal, the media world's equivalent of the ancient sage living in a remote tower guarded by dragons (or a very, very high subscription fee, in our case) -- see http://nationaljournal.com/about/njweekly/contacts.htm#freedberg for a gateway into the tiny segments of our website available to the public. I write about the military, veterans' affairs, and homeland security, which infuses me with a certain energizing combination of fatalism, dark humor, and barely suppressed panic. I am happy to reality-check people's RPG descriptions of military and security institutions on request.<br/>
<br/>
I played my first roleplaying game in freshman year of college with a group most of whom are still close friends. By junior year I'd gotten sufficiently dissatisfied with every system I'd played or GM'd I wrote my own, a setting mishmash of the  Empire and the World of Darkness with a system mostly derived from Amber. I ran a few PBEM games after graduation but otherwise left gaming until I ran across the Forge in general, and Tony Lower-Basch in particular, in 2003. I am now a mindless zombie in the dark army of cult leader Ron Edwards and have shambled forwards with my own game now in (slow) development,  (http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/Apocalypse_Girl.pdf).                        </div>

<i>who haven't I had a meal with here?</i><br/><br/>That would be me <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Like Sydney, my toddler makes it impossible to have much time, especially for something like GenCon, which I regret.<br/><br/>I guess I might have mentioned that I live in one of Portland, OR's suburbs. And again, due to lack of time, I haven't even had a chance to meet most of the local gamers such as Frank for a game, though I did manage to have breakfast with Chris Goodwin and family once.                        </div>

                            Sydney, your name's not that bad. My sister and I each have 5 names total, and have friends with even more.<br/><br/>I'm Selene Tan, nearly 22, and a senior Computer Science major at <a href="http://www.hmc.edu" rel="nofollow">Harvey Mudd College</a>, the "small liberal arts college" that stole Caltech's cannon. I was born and grew up in the Philippines, being half-Filipino half-Chinese myself, although I went to an international school and therefore have little national feeling. Also, English is my first language, which often surprises people.<br/><br/>I started gaming with Star Wars d6 about 8 years ago. Later I ended up in a D&amp;D 3rd ed campaign with a different GM and have a 33rd-level bard/herald of voices/vandalblade cartographer/symphony scion with hordes of devoted fans. (The last three are campaign-specific prestige classes.)<br/><br/>I dabble in music, art, and writing. I've participated in <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org" rel="nofollow">NaNoWriMo</a> for three years now, and succeeded once. Encouraged by NaNo, I managed to write a <a href="http://nightstaff.net/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Games.AMagicKingdomAfterBedtime" rel="nofollow">24-hour RPG</a>. My guilty pleasures include bad fantasy, space opera, and pop music. (I can measure my sleep deprivation by how much Backstreet Boys I listen to!) Also MMORPGs.<br/><br/>My name is pronounced like "Celery", not like "Celine". I can get a bit testy about this, especially when a teacher gets it wrong all semester...<br/><br/>If anyone's in the LA area, we should totally meet up! My school built a new dining hall and turned the old one into a giant living room--it's a great place to game.                        </div>

                            I'm Matt Snyder. I live in Iowa with my beautiful wife Canada (yes, like the country, no she's not from there, yes that's her real name, no the story behind it isn't very interesting -- can you tell I've done this before?) and our two happy kids Kate and Riggen. Kate talks a lot. Riggen mostly smiles. Great kids!<br/><br/>I spend way too much time on the Internet. The day job doesn't help. I work for a big publishing company. My gig is Multimedia Design Editor for a farming and rural life magazine division. That's a bullshit corporate title to say "We have Matt do whatever we need, 'cause he can do lots of stuff." At least they provide me cool toys.<br/><br/>I dig writing games, and still get a kick hearing about people who adore playing them. I wrote Dust Devils and Nine Worlds, and there's more on deck. I've also done layout and design work for many indie games, and have a couple on deck there as well.<br/><br/>I used to publish the short-lived 'zine Daedalus. It was a lot of work. <br/><br/>I like to drink Southern Comfort. I haven't had any in over a month. I'll soon be seeking a remedy for that. In fact, join me at the <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=18742.0" rel="nofollow">Forge Midwest gathering</a> Friday, April 7 at the Radisson Schaumburg bar. I'll be there drinking with friends. You should too. (Ok, so I'll be drinking SoCo before then, sure. Sue me.)<br/><br/>Speaking of remedies, right now I have heartburn. Maybe it's because I'm not actually writing games like I should be. No SoCo tonight, by God!<br/><br/>I am not superstitious.<br/><br/>Trivia moment. I live about 9,620,160 feet from where John H lives now.<br/><br/>I appreciate the friends I've made doing this crazy indie rpg scene more than I can explain to them. So, I eagerly await seeing them again soon.                        </div>

                            Hi, I'm Kuma.  It was a weird name to grow up with, but we all have our crosses to bear.<br/><br/>Just kidding.  My actual, real name is Brian Hollenbeck (and I have to say it's odd for me to actually say that 'out loud' on the internet).  I'm exactly twice as old as Jeph, and I live in the virulently liberal city of Madison, Wisconsin, which is only one expressway from Matt Wilson.  I have a lovely wife, Amy, who's going for her PhD in Special Education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  (Go Badgers!)  We enjoy recreational procreation, and so there's also the ray of sun named Sophie in my life, who's a defiant 3 years old.<br/><br/>My 'day' job is, in fact, the graveyard shift.  I watch over the state backbone network and the central computer(s) of the State of Wisconsin.  People are invariably impressed or confused when I tell them what I do for a living.  It's neither all that impressive or confusing.  I just make sure that everyone's lottery tickets, sales taxes, income taxes, 911 calls, parking and traffic tickets, ID checks, Medicare benefits, interstate commerce, sex offender registries, license plates, driver's licenses, unemployment checks, welfare checks, clean air permits and Homeland Security requirements process with a minimum of fuss and bother.<br/><br/>As for where and when I've lived:
<blockquote>0-5: Nazareth, PA - Trivia: I lived only a few blocks away from Mario Andretti.<br/>6-13: Troy, PA<br/>14-17: Horseheads, NY<br/>18-21: Troy, NY <br/>22-26: Rochester, NY<br/>27-30: Baltimore, MD<br/>31-Present: Madison, WI</blockquote>
I've been married once before to a woman I'll only refer to as Kumawife the Terrible.  I was 18 and stupid.<br/><br/>Still working on my first RPG credits - I have some uncredited layout and illustration work.  I was, as most of you probably know, the administrator on RPG.net for a couple of years.  I was young and stupid then, too.<br/><br/>My other autodidactic interests include: history (primarily from the Fall of Rome to the Rennaisance with a concentration in economic and ecclesiastical history), advanced mathematics, genetic computing, complexity theory and cosmology.  I can also cook like a motherfucker.<br/><br/>I dig the indie RPG scene because I see it as being in the same spirit as Wozniack &amp; Jobs in 1976 - something that's happening in people's garages that has the potential to truly blow shit up at some point down the road.                        </div>

                            Well, this seems like as good a thread as any for my first post, so...<br/>
<br/>
Hey, all, my name is JoÃƒÂ£o Mendes, I'm 33 years old, and I'm married to my lovely wife Ana. We are both gamers, though I've been playing since I was 14, and she's oinly been playing since I was finally able to convince her, a few years back.<br/>
<br/>
I was born in Luanda, Angola, back when it was a Portuguese colony, and I now live in Lisbon, Portugal, where I've been for most of my life, except for a three year tour of duty in Blacksburg, VA, USA, during high-school, which was neat.<br/>
<br/>
I do freelance computer stuff because I can, I have my own investment company because it's the Right Thing To Do(tm) and I'm finally starting into game design because it's something I've wanted to do for at least 15 years.<br/>
<br/>
Been a Forgite off and on since 2002 and I've been trying to sell other gamers I know on the fact that theory is a Good Thing(tm) and that they should try different games once in a while, if only because they'll learn to like the ones they polay now that much better. Alas, I've met with limited success.<br/>
<br/>
Working on publishing Project Senate, my first RPG right now. Maybe when (if? no, definitely when) I finaly get it out there, I'll have some more credibility with these dudes. <br/>
<br/>
I have a burning need to discuss more RPG theory. I'd blog, but there's too much of that already. I wanna discuss, man. Discuss, I say!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
J.<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Also, back in college, I once played Elendor MUSH for 25 hours straight, after working for five hours. I'm saying this, because when I say "straight", it has a different meaning than what you might think. I stopped when I finally had to get up to go pee. Yes, I'm a geek. My wife knows this and she loves me anyway, so there! :)                        </div>

                            I feel compelled to respond, so here goes:<br/><br/>I'm Stefan Dirk Lahr, which is pretty common in Deutschland, but since i'm American, i'm used to being addressed as Stephen, Steve, Stef, Stefon, Stefen, Schtefahn, and so on. I'm at least equally comfortable with Sempiternity or Selentic.<br/><br/>In reality layer 0, i'm something of a massive introvert. Which means i don't have much of a real life, all in all. <br/><br/>Here in reality layer 1, on the other hand, i tend to be a little extroverted, at least by comparison.<br/><br/>I have a feeling the dichotomy inherent in that divide is what gives rise to my somewhat peculiar, over-hasty posting habits. I'm getting better, though. Really, i am!<br/><br/>In real life, i'm 24, and about as native Pennsylvanian as a Northern European ethnic can get. <br/>I've recently obtained a bachelor of science degree at East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania, which is probably the only thing i've managed to complete in my entire life. Right now, i'm trying to get my Masters, in Biology, to prove to myself that i have what it takes to go on to further academic work. <br/>I've considered work teaching secondary school, like many of my classmates, and may have to yet, but find myself rather terrified by the current state of public education. (Short version: Teachers have to do all the work, Kids &amp; Parents get whatever they want/sue for.)<br/><br/>Online, i've been immersing myself in the indie RPG scene since September last year, and feel i've made great strides in comprehension of my primary hobby. I hope to contribute something, publish something, but i've never been particularly good at seizing noospace, and i still have much, much to learn about the craft. <br/>My blog, <a href="http://selentic.livejournal.com/" rel="nofollow">Transparency</a>, has become almost entirely gaming oriented, serving as my primary 'working space' for any ideas that get past the 'lightbulb' stage.<br/><br/>Somewhere in between those two levels, i'm a fan of electronic eurotrash musik, such as played by <a href="http://cms.ebm-radio.de/com/modules.php?name=latest_tracks" rel="nofollow">ebm-radio.de</a>, and a lover of  books that fall into the arenas of military Science fiction, hard SF, and, oddly enough, urban fantasy. <br/>I love to cook, as well, but only vegetarian, spicy, multi-ethnic dishes. Also: <a href="http://www.adagio.com/" rel="nofollow">Tea!</a><br/>My tastes are probably more diverse than i give them credit for here - i'm something of a xenophile. As long as it is new, i love it.<br/><br/>I've been gaming pretty much my entire life, from Risk to Magic to Warhammer, but only RPGs for about the past decade. Finding people to play with has been a challenge, but the potential makes it all worthwhile, always. <br/>My favourite non-RPGs are <a href="http://redamedia.com/warp/index.php3" rel="nofollow">Cosmic Encounter</a> (Mayfair edition) for boardgames, and <a href="http://www.stargrunt.ca/" rel="nofollow">Stargrunt</a> for miniature wargames.  <br/><br/>I've mostly played DND &amp; GURPS, and mostly "one-shots", which seems to be massively at odds with most people's experiences! <br/><br/>I'd also like to say, i really feel indebted to all of you in this community, for evrything that i've learned about art &amp; gaming this past year. Thanks!                        </div>

                            I am, unsurprisingly, Jack Aidley. I am 29 and I live in Coventry, England.<br/><br/>I grew up in rural Norfolk, in a village with two churches, a playground, a pub and a postbox. My first introduction to Roleplaying was red box D&amp;D that my parents bought home to us when I was seven. My brothers &amp; I played D&amp;D, Traveller, TMNT, Paranoia and Dragon Warriors (among others)  for many years before I got all Christian and the church told us RPGs were evil and I burnt all my roleplaying books (to my now eternal regret).<br/><br/>I later became an Atheist and began roleplaying again when I started University and now play once or twice a week. After Uni I stumbled into a job as a Games Programmer before moving into my current job doing CAD/CAM stuff, although I may be going back to games shortly.<br/><br/>I wrote <a href="http://www.greatorkgods.co.uk" rel="nofollow">Great Ork Gods</a> which I will release properly when my brother finally finishes the damn artwork, and won one of the Iron Game Chef contests with <a href="http://www.chanter.greatorkgods.co.uk" rel="nofollow">Chanter</a> - which I'm currently in the process of thoroughly re-doing.                        </div>

                            Hello everyone<br/><br/>I too am a Brit and known as Joe Prince.<br/><br/>I live in a small seaside town in the north of England called Scarborough. But I'm no stranger to the US, since my family moved to Colorado 6 years ago.<br/><br/>I'm 27 and engaged to wonderful Marie, who is a little bit stressed at the moment with her doctorate thesis in clincal psychology.<br/>I've also got a MA in psychology from Edinburgh Uni and currently work for a mental health crisis service - so please no erroneous use of 'brain damage' ;-)<br/><br/>I've been gaming for many years now, but even as a kid I used to make up my own games and after discovering the forge about a year ago I'm making my own rpgs for real now!<br/><br/>My first 24hr rpg was published by UKG about 10 months ago, I've now got three games for sale and my Ronny winning boxing game <a href="www.princeofdarknessgames.com/contenders.htm" rel="nofollow">Contenders</a> is about to be released.<br/><br/>I've also put pen to paper to come up with my own rpg <a href="www.princeofdarknessgames.com/theory.htm" rel="nofollow">theory</a> which refreshes the parts GNS fails to reach. Immersion mainly.<br/><br/>I'm an indie kid at heart, I like indie music, indie films and indie rpgs. And my favourite movie quote is fom Indiana Jones: <br/>"Nazis.

You know, it's amazing to me how many of us have/are working on graduate degrees or are maried to someone who has/is working on a graduate degree.  I myself am getting my Masters in Special Education.  It's really something that I had not expected and am quite interested to find out.  Cool.<br/>

                            I am David Wendt, 35 year old Ph.D. Statistician.  Go ahead and call me Blue or Doc Blue, it's not just a internet tag, it's a full-fledged nickname.  My livejournal nick is 'bluelang', and I don't post their nearly enough anymore.  In my real life, I do associate research for a Fortune 100 Company.<br/>
<br/>
I am married to an awesome woman who not only tolerates my gaming addiction but encourages it. I have two hyper-intelligent children (almost 5 and almost 1 year respectively), who are also too cute for words.<br/>
<br/>
I've lived more places than I can count, but I will say that through freshman year of college I had been to as many schools as I had been in years of school. I currently live in Columbus, Ohio - host city to Origins and my lovely wife and I host a barbeque at our home during the event.<br/>
<br/>
I have writing credits in several gaming books, mostly White Wolf or Swords and Sorcery produced.  Currently, I have several games in various states of 'not complete', but my focus is on "Quick Kid in the Virtual World", the game I am writing for/with my Five-Year-Old Son, who we shall refer to as alternatively 'Quick Kid' or 'The Indigo Jester'.                        </div>

                            Hi, I'm Emily Care Boss. I live in Western Massachusetts in a cooperative household in a farm that I co-own (!).  Other residents include 11(?) chickens, 4 sheep, 3 dogs, 3 cats and 3 other free-range people one of whom, Serena, designed and  built the house (with lots of community help) and is the sister of Meguey Baker.  Meg &amp;  Vincent are my best friends &amp; are essentially family, as are their three kids, so I'm psyched. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I grew up in Connecticut, but moved to Massachusetts to go to school at <a href="http://www.umass.edu" rel="nofollow">UMass Amherst</a> and stayed in the pioneer valley for good.  The progressive atmosphere here is good for the soul and it's nice to mostly just be able to be myself. I'm very close to earning my master's degree in Forestry at Umass and may even be able to use the degree this time around.<br/><br/>I'm single, involved, anglo-teutonic caucasian, bi, poly, pagan, feminist, socialist etc. yadda, yadda.  A terrific geek.  I've role played since my undergrad college days and am happy to have a great play group now including the Bakers, Joshua Newman and Carrie Bernstein and others (who I hope to see more once I graduate). <b>And</b> I'm glad that Meg is <a href="http://www.fairgame-rpgs.com/comment.php?entry=40" rel="nofollow">bringing others in</a>.  <br/><br/>I'm loving this forum. It feels so good to have an oasis of good feeling &amp; real respect. It makes me realize how stressful the internet usually is.                        </div>

                            Adam Cerling, age 28, living in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I've got a masters in Computer Science from the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York. Today I work for Wells Fargo doing software development and support.<br/>
<br/>
I got into Computer Science because of video games. I longed to create experiences for people like those I had playing Zelda and Final Fantasy, so I supplemented my CS with lots of Film and Animation electives.<br/>
<br/>
Five years ago I tried and failed to break into the video-game industry, and that really hurt. I ended up here in Document Imaging Technology. But I'm on the cusp of trying again. I really need to work in a field that I can love.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever I try to express how foundational to my life is my faith in Christ, I sound like a doof. I find that C. S. Lewis explains it better anyhow. For the last six months I have been helping start a new church. We meet in a movie theater, which I think is awfully cool. I help with the multimedia.<br/>
<br/>
I'm single, by choice.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot make a post without going back to tweak and edit it thirty seconds later.<br/>
<br/>
I gained some notoriety in the White Wolf LARP scene by writing <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.grapevinelarp.com" rel="nofollow">Grapevine</a>, a computer program which became the de facto choice for creating and tracking LARP character sheets. Now I'm working on <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.grapevinelarp.com/EndsAndMeans" rel="nofollow">Ends and Means</a>, my own LARP system, instead. I'm in the midst of running a five-act series of playtests with a dozen players.                        </div>

                            I'm Gregor Hutton and I'm in the UK too. I've been gaming since the early 80s and I'm maybe known to you as one of the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.gregorhutton.com/roleplaying/killbargle_ruff.mov" rel="nofollow">Kill Bargle</a> guys.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, biographical stuff. I'm 33 and I currently live and work in Edinburgh, Scotland. I was born just outside Glasgow and lived there for most of my life. I went to the University of Glasgow and graduated with an honours degree in Astronomy &amp; Physics in 1994, but decided against following an academic life.<br/>
<br/>
While sitting my final exams I was also writing and illustrating for a roleplaying game called <b>Frenzy</b>, that was published in early 1995 by a short-lived outfit called Venture Press. I would describe it as a gritty Feng Shui without the magic or the editing.<br/>
<br/>
Since then I've done <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://gregorhutton.com/roleplaying/" rel="nofollow">some games stuff</a>, a lot of which languishes unpublished. Most recently I put out two Ronnies games (<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://gregorhutton.com/roleplaying/bf.pdf" rel="nofollow">Best Friends</a> and <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://gregorhutton.com/roleplaying/3-16.pdf" rel="nofollow">3:16</a>) that I feel are not too bad. I also wrote <b>Ghostfighter</b> for a|state and have made some maps.<br/>
<br/>
Outside of gaming I worked for about 6 months as a journalist and then as an editor for about 11 years on scientific journals (astronomy and earth sciences). I was an in-house expert on electronic artwork for about 5 years before I became a line manager. At some point I expect to jump off that train and rejoin the real world.<br/>
<br/>
I like design and typography, Apple Macs, Sheryl Crow, Madonna and American Football.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and if any of you UK guys aren't coming to the Indie Games Track at <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.conpulsion.org" rel="nofollow">Conpulsion</a> in Edinburgh at the end of March, why not?!                        </div>

                            I'm really enjoying reading about you all.  Last night I read some of your biographies out loud to my wife, who thought you sounded like pretty cool people - I concur!  It's nice to have some <em>context</em> - for example, I followed Ends and Means discussions on the Forge, Adam Cerling, but had no idea you had a strong history with LARP.  Adam Dray, for some reason I had not heard about FiranMUX.  <br><br>All the commonalities are intriguing, and so are the crazy differences.                        </br></br></div>

                            I'm Graham Walmsley, I'm 33 and I live in London. Oddly enough, I work as a professional roleplayer, which means I do acting work to help companies recruit. Sometimes I describe myself as an actor. For a day job, I'm a medical secretary in a mental health hospital.<br>
<br>
Before retraining as an actor, I worked for six years as a software engineer. I lived in various places, including California for a year.<br>
<br>
In California, I got involved with a rather good White Wolf Vampire game. (I can vouch that Adam's program, Grapevine, is used a lot.)<br>
<br>
Since coming back, I've started running various one-short LARPs at conventions. It's an extraordinary amount of fun. The first one was a Paranoia / Cthulhu crossover LARP, called "Will All Elder Gods Report For Termination?". The second one was an All Creatures Great and Small / American Werewolf In London crossover ("All Creatures Crazed And Feral") and, shortly, I'll run a Terry Pratchett / Mage crossover: "Wizzard: The Dozing".<br>
<br>
When I do LARPs, I like to stand on chairs and shout while waving my arms about. I desperately want to run a game called "Grand Theft Auto: Narnia" but can't think of a way to do it.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

Anyway, I'm Rob Donoghue, 33, currently residing in Columbia, MD, a bizarre little artificial community halfway between DC and Baltimore.  I commute far to far for my work as a Systems Analyst for a tech company down in Virginia.  I used to work for the Senate Judiciary Committee, but I swapped over to the tech world when i realized I was making less money than an assistant manager at Taco Bell.  I was born in and went to school in Vermont, moved down to DC, met a nice Girl, Moved to Silicon Valley, got married, and am now back in the DC area because there was no way we were going to buy a house in California.<br>
<br>
Got into gaming withe the old Red Box D&amp;D, but really got into it with Rolemaster and with far, far, far too much time spent playing on AmberMUSH.<br>
My main claim to fame, so to speak,  is co-authoring Fate with my co-conspirator Fred, though my Fudge on the Fly article occasionally gains me random props.<br>
<br/>
Beyond that, I've met a couple people here, but not as many as I'd like to.<br/>

                            I'm Brendan Adkins.  I grew up in Georgetown and Richmond, KY, got a BS in drama and comp sci at Centre in Danville, and last spring received my MS in comp sci at the University of Louisville.  Now I'm trying to achieve sufficient velocity to escape Kentucky.  Until I read Troy's post above, I was reasonably sure I was the only person in the state who was aware of indie gaming.  I work as a systems analyst and I live with my girlfriend Maria, an MD-PhD student who could kill me with her brain.<br/><br/>Online, I <a href="http://www.xorph.com/creator/" rel="nofollow">complain</a>, run a <a href="http://www.xorph.com/dispatch/" rel="nofollow">tiny game design community</a> and write <a href="http://www.xorph.com/anacrusis/" rel="nofollow">101 words</a> at a time.<br/><br/>My friends in Louisville are video and board gamers, so all my role-playing for the last couple years has been with distant friends via AIM.  It's fun, but not fast; our first town in Dogs took almost two months.  Before that we played Nobilis.  My very first game was red-box D&amp;D, probably around age 11.<br/><br/>I'm relaxed about being Catholic and a psychotic zealot about copyright reform.  Thanks to Netflix, I'm finally starting to acquire a working vocabulary of film, and I want to write for television someday.  I'm 24.                        </div>

My name is Mark, and I'm 34. I am formerly (-1980) Latvian-Russian but these days I live in Israel with my wife and son. We still hope our runaway cat will return someday.<br/>
<br/>
I have a bachelor's degree in CS and English Lit, with no master's in sight. (That would be an English Lit MA, of course. But there is no time, no money, and most importantly no real inclination.) I am a senior programmer/team leader at a software company called Giant Steps [www.giant-steps.com]. I work too much, and much time is spent unnecessarily on transportation. We have here lots of traffic jams and a lack of proper ways to commute. This sucks big time.<br/>
<br/>
I love good food, especially my wife's cooking (favorite: her tiramisu). I love good movies, of which it seems there is a shortage last year (favorite: Terry Gilliam's <i>Brazil</i>). So I returned to the long-forgotten books, and it was good (favorite: Conrad's <i>Heart of Darkness</i>).<br/>
<br/>
I don't have the time or the energy for a blog. I only participate regularly in one internet forum (Israeli RP Society). I use too much parentheses. I am very self-aware and, as a result, quite critical of myself.<br/>
<br/>
I'm a jew, but I'm not religious (atheist + secular humanist). I use FreeBSD, but I'm not religious about it either.                        </div>

                            I am John Aegard.  The nickname is a hockey / BBS thing that's stuck.    I'm 34, for those doing demographics.<br>
<br>
I'm married to an awesome woman.  Today is our wedding anniversary, in fact.   A small, ottoman-like dog completes our family.<br>
<br>
I'm Canadian, but I live in Seattle.  I adore Seattle.  I've also lived in Portland and Ottawa.  There is an affinity to deeply repressed cities coded somewhere in my DNA.<br>
<br>
I'm a software engineer and an ESL teacher.  At night, I write comics and short science fiction.  I've been in Interzone and The Third Alternative and some magazines that aren't even in the UK.   My fiction highlight is publishing "The Great Old Pumpkin" on strangehorizons.com.  That got forwarded around the  internet a bit, and I still get the occasional email about it.   <br/>
<br/>
Once upon a time I tried to pursue a serious fiction writing career, but after getting to see how serious fiction writing careers are built, I decided that wasn't the key to happiness--at least not right now.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            This is teh cool.<br/><br/>I'm Nathan D. Paoletta, 21, half-white-half-Italian. I'm finishing up my History/Politics double-major at <a href="http://www.brandeis.edu" rel="nofollow">Brandeis University</a> in Waltham MA, a suburb of Boston. No, I'm not jewish. No, I wasn't aware of the whole jewish thing when I came here. Yes, sometimes I miss the bleedingly obvious.<br/><br/>I was born in Hawaii, lived in Idaho and then my family settled in New Mexico, first Santa Fe and then Albuquerque, which is where I consider myself to be "from." Holla 505. I try to bring the sun and green chile spirit with me wherever I go.<br/><br/>I started playing RPGs with red-box D&amp;D - ah, you can <a href="http://hamsterprophet.blogspot.com/2006/02/my-history-with-roleplay.html" rel="nofollow">read about my history with role-play</a> if you're really interested. Designing games is the most fun ever. Timestream is my first-and-actually-released, and I'm currently working on Carry. I think it might have to go on a bit of a hold, as I need to get my post-graduation life together, and soon. This prospect makes me sad.<br/><br/>I do technical theatre, primarily set design, sound design, and scenic construction and painting. Let me know if you know of any Boston-area theatres that are hiring. It's what I want to do with my life, unless something drastic changes.<br/><br/>I had a fucking blast at Dreamation 2006, and am totally looking forward to ICON and GenCon. <br/><br/>My musical taste can best be summed up in a quote from my father: "I'm not going to get you CDs for Christmas anymore. You listen to wierd music. I'll get you gift cards instead." I wear primarily earthtones, and really should exercise more. I love my Macs like how Clinton does.<br/><br/>My girlfriend is amazing and lovely and not a gamer at all. I miss my dogs, but look forward to getting cats. It's kind of intimidating that you're all way older than me. Those of you that I've met, I've really liked.<br/><br/>Rock. \m/                        </div>

Dude, Nathan. I find it intimidating that you've got an RPG published at 21 while I'm still dorking around with my first one at 32. We older folks just have mortgages and shit, nothing to feel intimdated about :-P<br/><br/>Timestream looks real interesting, by the way. It's on my to-buy list.                        </div>

I was addicted to Werewolf for a year and a half or so, and now I'm greatly enjoying The Shadow of Yesterday (thanks Clinton!) and trying to convice my friends that Capes doesn't have to be silly.<br/>

                            My name is Bill White, and I just turned 40.  I'm from New Jersey, but I live in Pennsylvania now.  I'm a college professor who teaches public speaking and media-related courses; I got my Ph.D. in communication in 2001 from Rutgers University.  I'm married with a two-year-old little girl.  My wife also teaches communication, although at a different school than mine.  We met in grad school.<br/>
<br/>
I started playing D&amp;D in high school; my first character was a dwarf fighter named Mensch who picked up the Axe of the Dwarven Lords on the 3rd level of the dungeon.  I ran a long-term campaign through high school and a little bit into college (where I also played a little Champions).  My D&amp;D campaign was a thing of beauty:  broad sweeping plotlines with characters scattered across the multiverse but coming together at the end to confront the Great Evil, who in one instance turned out to be Mighty Cthulhu (luckily, someone had an Elder Sign).<br/>
<br/>
I graduated from college and went into the Army, stopped roleplaying but missed it.  When I got out, I went back to graduate school.  I managed to sell two articles to Dragon magazine in about five years of trying--one was called "Dangerous Ground" and was about staging dramatic fight scenes.  The other was called "The Hero with 1d1000 Faces" and was a random adventure generator.<br/>
<br/>
And then I stumbled on the Forge.<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm working on a game called Ganakagok that I plan to have ready to sell as a PDF by May.  After that, I have a ton of other ideas I want to pursue.  I love these games.                        </div>

                            Hey all, to answer Adam, the thing I'm finding most interesting is what we choose to share and what we choose to not share about ourselves.  I was also a little surprised to see the homogeneity in age, education, and profession.  Weirdly, a large chunk of us could have a good excuse to get together professionally and swap business cards.                        </div>

                            I'm Warren Merrifield, another Englishman, 30. I'm from Essex, but now live in Leeds. I've got a Masters degree in (Aerospace) Systems Engineering from Loughborough, but I've been in the computer games industry since '97. I now work for Rockstar Leeds - I was a programmer on Grand Theft Auto:Liberty City Stories for the PSP most recently.<br/><br/>I was brought up Church of England, but I'm not a religious person. I play a lot of small-stakes Texas Hold 'Em with guys from work (I dislike online play). I'm living with my girlfriend - a lovely park ranger who isn't really a roleplayer but loves board &amp; card games. I have an iMac, I worship Google in all its forms, and I drive a <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=smart%20fortwo" rel="nofollow">smart fortwo</a> which provokes some amusement from onlookers (I'm 6'5"). <br/><br/>I started roleplaying with the Marvel Super Heros Basic Set at the age of 10 (I was diagnosed diabetic at the same age, coincidentally) and did a lot of Classic Traveller then a great deal of Shadowrun. A looong Vampire campaign followed out of university until our GM burned-out and I became dissaffected with roleplaying... Until I stumbled across a website that mentioned Dogs in the Vineyard last year. The Forge followed, and now I've joined up to two groups - one very wargamey that does AD&amp;D who took to DitV pretty easily, and another bunch of Vampire players who I'm going to try running Dogs for soon. And can you believe that I had never played *D&amp;D of any type until about six months ago?                        </div>

<code>I guess I might have mentioned that I live in one of Portland, OR's suburbs. And again, due to lack of time, I haven't even had a chance to meet most of the local gamers such as Frank for a game, though I did manage to have breakfast with Chris Goodwin and family once.</code><br/><br/>Which would be my cue, I guess.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>Chris Goodwin, age 35.  Married to Lisa, we have a four year old, Andrew.  I was orn in California, grew up in Oregon.  Entered the Air Force at age 18, what little time I didn't spend in Texas was in California.  Back to Oregon after getting out of there.  Lived in Oregon until my wife and I moved to Raleigh, NC in late 1998, moved to Garland, TX in 2002, then back to Oregon in 2003.  <br/><br/>I currently work as a PC technician for a very large construction company in the Portland area.  I use Linux on my computer at home, but I do Windows because my wife uses it and because I get paid to.  <br/><br/>I got started with RPGs in 1981 with *D&amp;D, bought and played through most or all of the TSR stable of boxed RPGs, then in 1985 discovered Champions.  Have been less of a Hero partisan since 4th and 5th edition came out but I still like it (though I'm not sure I can call it my favorite system anymore).  I started reading the Forge in '02, registered in May '03 but in all that time have done little more than lurk, and wasn't really "into" indie games until PTA.  I think half of my postings there came from birthday week this year (and I got the Last Word for '05...).  <br/><br/>As mentioned, we met Christian (xenopulse) for breakfast once, but unfortunately haven't had time to get together again.  I'd very much like to meet up with some of the other Portland area indie gamers for (preferably) PTA or (alternately) Dogs or, heck, any gaming at all, as I've been stuck in an over six year almost-dry spell.  I have done quite a bit of board/card gaming (Looney Labs stuff, Illuminati, Settlers of Catan, other hobby board games), which takes the edge off but doesn't really satisfy it, you know?                        </div>

                            I'm Colin Fredericks (no surprise there). I'm a 27-year old doctoral student in Physics (specifically, physics education).<br/>
<br/>
I live in Sunderland, Massachusetts. I normally live with my woman, but she's in Tanzania right now for a term abroad. I'm originally from Vernon, Vermont, and still mostly identify as a Vermonter. I went to Northfield Mt. Hermon, then RPI, then still RPI, then UMass Amherst (where I am now). I still have a lot of friends in the Troy/Albany area.<br/>
<br/>
I run <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.valentgames.com/" rel="nofollow">Valent Games</a>. In fact, 90% of the time it would be fair to say that I *am* Valent Games. My latest published thing was <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.valentgames.com/console.shtml" rel="nofollow">Super Console</a>, which is doing awesome right now. I started playing games back in 5th grade, with D&amp;D and GURPS, and have the widest (though not deepest) game collection of any of my friends.<br/>
<br/>
I'm a serial monogamist: I date the same person exclusively for several years in a row, and then end up in another long-term relationship. Unfortunately, I don't seem to be all that good at it. Hopefully this time it'll stick - I really like her.<br/>
<br/>
Miscellanea: I'm a Mac user, I help teaching American Style Karate at the dojo Monday nights, I'm running two games a week (Exalted and <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://community.livejournal.com/suffadv/" rel="nofollow">Sufficiently Advanced</a>), I like using physics to break my friends' minds, and right now I have a small black kitty named Shinobi napping on my lap.<br/>
<br/>
I intend to start a private high school.                        </div>

                            My name's Nancy McKeown and I currently split my time between Santa Cruz, CA, where I'm a graduate student in Geology, and Stanford, CA with my boyfriend, Albert Andersen, who conveniently forgot to mention me in his post.  :P  I've lived in five different countries, studied five languages (if you include English), have three sisters, and no pets.  :(  Hello to the fellow Canadians!  I did most of my growing up in Ottawa.  I've been gaming for approximately four years now, my first game being D&amp;D 3.5, and since then I've played home-brew, Cthulhu, and a horde of others.  My current favourite is Polaris, of which Albert just gave me my own copy.  :)  For my research I'd like to look at Mars.  I also dance: scottish country, highland, and belly dancing.                        </div>

                            My name is James Jeffers. I am 34 years old, married and have a 4 year old child. I've lived in Raleigh, North Carolina since 1999. Before that I was a graduate student at the University of Florida. Before that I spent a few years as an unemployed Mass Comm graduate in Tampa, Florida. I work in software, but I dream daily of owning and operating a inter-planetary ore mining conglomerate. Either that or retiring so I can hike tha Appalachian Trail from Georgia to Maine.<br>
<br>
Cut my teeth on the old, old Red Box D&amp;D in 1982. One year my older, Satan worhsipping cousin from Texas showed me how the game was really played. He made me distrust sneaky NPC magic users forever. I don't really know if he worshipped Satan, but he had cool sunglasses.<br>
<br>
I am very surprised at the number of RPG publishers and designers who live within an hour of my house. Something good will come of this, I just know it.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            My name is Neelakantan Krishnaswami, and many people call me Neel. I am 29 years old, live in Pittsburgh, and am a graduate student in computer science. Poetically speaking, I make up new logics, and prosaically, I study the formal semantics of programming languages. Before that, I lived in Boston and worked as a computer programmer. <br/>
<br/>
I've been playing roleplaying games for 17 years, starting with Red Box D&amp;D, and moving on to GURPS for SF, and then really branching out 11 years ago, when I went to college, and discovered Internet discussion fora. <br/>
<br/>
Of the earlier posters, I have played with peaseblossom and her husband Jere, and with Mr. Teapot and his wife.                        </div>

                            Hi, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Charles Wotton, and as this is on the second page, where probably no one will read it, I can say anything I like (but I'll try not to abuse my power).  <br/>
<br/>
IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m 36 and live in Toronto, where I grew up (though in between IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve lived in England, Spain, and Russia).  I enjoy walking and cycling, reading and writing, singing and dancing, and making a fool of myself in front of others (which affords me a small wage as an English as a second language teacher).  I have two degrees, both BAs and both in whatever looked interesting and fit into my schedule (officially Liberal StudiesÃ¢â‚¬â€Great Books, and, um, Independent Studies).  My marks were considerably better the second time 'round.<br/>
<br/>
I played my first rpg on my tenth birthday, but for most of the 90s gaming was replaced by the Society for Creative Anachronism, social activism, and travelling.  Now I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t travel so much (working abroad at jobs with no health plans didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work out so well after a kidney transplant), game with my SCA friends (but donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t actually go to SCA events), and try to keep up with the social activism.  <br/>
<br/>
IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been lurking around the Forge and other such indie rpg sites for a couple of years now, but as it seems to take me hours to write anything for the web, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t expect an overwhelming stream of posts from me.  But IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be around.                        </div>

                            Damn, I'm normally all over posting to these kinds of threads, but lately I've been kinda spiritually ill, physically worn out and busy as all hell at work. Anyway, I'll post something quick here, head to bed and maybe add more later if I'm up for it.<br/><br/>I'm James Andrew Kitkowski (age 31), so I always comment on the Anyway blog as "JAK". I lived in New Jersey, Baton Rouge, Chicagoland, Green Bay, Tokyo and Gunma Japan, and now live in the Triangle (specifically Cary) in North Carolina, and loving it here. I really think that this place is one of the better places in this world to be.<br/><br/>I've worked all kinds of jobs, but my career is currently enterprise-level computer support (focusing on storage, but also Windows, Unix and Networking).  I don't help you with yout mouse, I help you when all of your email servers in your data centers are down. It's high stress, but luckily it's also medium-high reward, and I love the work too.<br/><br/>I'm married to Orie, my wife of some seven years. No kids in the picture, but three cats. She is the most awesome cook in the world (she's basically cooked like a housewife since the death of her mom, so some nearly 20 years now). Our conversations at home look pretty much like the conversation between Han Solo and Greedo. Also, I've been reading a lot more Japanese stuff during the day (about 30-60 minutes every evening), which I realized is directly proportional with the amount of severe headaches I've been having as well. Ahhh, living the bilingual life...<br/><br/>I love all sorts of games, but lately I've been a little burned out an balls-to-the-wall narrativist gaming, and am looking to play more structured stuff over the next two months (and things like simple board and card games), as well as read some books and stuff to recharge over the next two months.<br/><br/>I love music, primarily (real) experimental, new age and techno, but am up for just about anything. I used to be the station manager of my college's radio station, and also a techno DJ at small raves and the like in the US and Japan, though I haven't been to a club since my return to the US.<br/><br/>I used to be really heavy into dancing and martial arts (namely Aikido, Wing Chun Kung Fu and Tae Kwan Do), and had been doing them for years, but nothing lately, which is why I've become a big fucking creampuff. That and I have very little self control when it comes to food (No, Andy, your metabolism is not what it was in college!).  My goal is to lose 20 pounds this year, and to lose a total of (from Right Now to My Goal) some 50 pounds in the next 3 years. <br/><br/>Uh... Er... I'm listening to this week's broadcast of Hearts of Space (www.hos.com), which is rocking, I'm doing more Tenra Bansho (www.tenra-rpg.com) translation tonight, and I'm writing an RPG which I realized needs a bit more rulework, and is totally going to look like a bastard hybrid of a filthy hippie Forge game and a "Hey, GM, your cock is in my ass!" traditional sim game. You basically hunt down Clive Barker-ish evil in your modified green El Camino and shoot it with shotguns, and that's about it. It's gorgeous.<br/><br/>That's about it.  I also have blogs on www.kitkowski.com (read only), and my LJ name is "zigguratbuilder" for my gaming and "stuff I don't want my family to see" stuff.                        </div>

                            IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Claire, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m 28 and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m from Melbourne, Australia.  Ethnically, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m part Manx, the celts even the Scots and Irish think are insane weirdos.  Religiously, raised atheist, sent to an Anglican school, currently oblivious.  Those are the bits I put in because other people were mentioning them.  ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s weird to describe myself that way.<br/><br/>I work as a statistician for the police force.  Previously IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve worked in market research and data entry.  I have a BSc in Psychology and a BA in Criminology.  I got into gaming during university after reading and loving the Amber books by Roger Zelazny.  I searched the student union libraryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s catalogue for other books related to Amber and found they had a copy of the Amber DRPG.  I borrowed it, found it rather strange, found out more about it online, and joined a PBEM.  When I took a year to study in Glasgow as part of my degree, the first friends I made just happened to be major lights in the roleplaying club.<br/><br/>When contemplating post-graduate study in psychology I was thinking of researching social interactions in virtual and imagined space, which led me to look at roleplaying theory.  This then exposed me to a number of different games.<br/><br/>Roleplaying is not my first hobby.  ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actually Guiding, as in Girl Guiding.  I am a Brownie Guide leader, with a group of 19 girls aged 6-10.  My friends say they are my minions, and that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m teaching them to take over the world.  Well, of course!  A lot of my approach to gaming has been shaped by my experiences as a guide leader.  I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t design games.  The weekly challenge of facilitating 7 year olds to set, plan, execute and evaluate their own shared creative endeavours puts me off the idea of doing anything similar for adults.  Kids donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t assume that stuff is too hard.  And kids have more powers of awesomeness!<br/><br/>In my fleeting remaining spare time I read, cook, make silly jokes, sleep and never manage to watch the tv I recorded because I was too busy at the time.<br/><br/>I have a <a href="http://www.skyseastone.net/frank" rel="nofollow">blog</a> where I talk about gaming and a livejournal (beingfrank) were I rant, complain, am silly, and put stuff I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to take time crafting.                        </div>

                            Hi, I'm RamÃƒÂ³n Nogueras, and chose my nickname because it sound pretty cool tome. Also, I dig Roman stuff a lot.<br/>
<br/>
I'm from Granada, Spain, and living with my awesome and very geek girlfriend in Madrid. I have also lived in Barcelona (Spain), Sweden and Ireland. I work as a headhunter in HR consultancy, which puts me in contact with tons of stupid people who run bussinesses in ways I can't understand. I'm also a psychotherapist, thoug the HR stuff is my main income source.<br/>
<br/>
My g/f and me like everything about stories (books, cinema, theater), and also paint minis, play videogames and listen to music. We laugh a lot. I'm very happy with my body, though I'm a lazy guy who hasn't exercised for years.<br/>
<br/>
I've been playing RPGs for 20 years, starting with Red Box D&amp;D, and have played tons of things. I've discovered the indie scene in the last year, and my gaming is better.                        </div>

                            I am a 43 year old white, male, fish monger, who lives with his girlfriendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cat in Chantilly VA. I guess Thor &amp; I will have to arm wrestle to figure out who is the eldest poster.<br/>
<br/>
I was born in Germany (army brat), but moved to Fairfax County VA before I was 1 and have lived here ever since.<br/>
<br/>
Religiously, I am too Pagan for the Christians in my life, and too Christian for the Pagans in my life.<br/>
LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not even discuss politics.<br/>
<br/>
I have been role playing since 1976, and am presently playing in 2 campaigns that are over 20 years old.<br/>
<br/>
I have no free time. But what time I do have I try to juggle between: petting the kitty, keeping the girlfriend (Michele) happy, making mead, helping out my mother, role playing, gardening, taking care of my fish, reading, watching DVDs, and generally consuming data.                        </div>

                            I'm Stuart Broz, a 33 year old guy living in Champaign-Urbana. I work for a non-profit, where I do a bit of everything. Most of that everything, however, seems to involve either grantwriting or coordinating mental health service access for underserved children.<br/>
<br/>
I'm overeducated. I have a law degree and a Masters in philosophy, both of which are from Georgetown. I stopped writing my dissertation after determining that I have a strong dislike of lecturing. Before that, I attended college in New Orleans (at Tulane). I've been feeling a pull to go back there lately.<br/>
<br/>
I live in a large, run-down house with several friends, reptiles, and rodents. One of these rodents is my pet chinchilla, Luna. I'm not married, but I am far from single. I am fairly certain that I have no children.<br/>
<br/>
I started using szilard as an online handle almost fifteen years ago because I felt like the physicist Leo Szilard, who was the closest thing I had to a personal hero at the time, had been largely erased from history. I just stuck with it.<br/>
<br/>
I spend much of my free time reading, painting, cooking, or noodling around with RPG-things. I have a new blog up at neitherworldstories.blogspot.com.                        </div>

                            Wow, it' s realy cool to read about the real people behind the posts, and see how many of you I've met (mostly thanks to Ron Edwards letting me help out with the Forge booth at last year's Gencon).<br/>
<br/>
I'm 42, married to a rabid non-gamer (which has been an issue throughout our 16 year marriage, but we've come to a decent compromise on it).  I have a lovely 2 year old daughter who talks non-stop and who we think is a genius.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up on military bases up and down the east coast of the US (navy brat), from Jacksonville to Norfilk VA to Providence RI.  My family moved to Naples, Florida when my dad retired, and I lived there until I moved to Gainesville for college (University of Florida).  I have a BA in Anthropology, with a focus on Historic Archaeology (basically, post-European contact North America).  I dropped out of grad school in Archaeology and went to Japan, hoping to make a bunch of money teaching English.  Unfortunately, I jumped on that bandwagon a little too late and came back after only 3 months.<br/>
<br/>
I got married, went back and finished an MA in History (Early Modern Europe) studying witchcraft and the Inquisition.  I worked off and on as an Archaeologist for 20 years (with 5 years doing data management for a research project on pre-natal cocaine exposure while my wife finished her PhD).  The most interesting places I worked were the first European settlement in the new world (a place called En Bas Saline in Haiti where Columbus had to leave 39 men when the Santa Maria sank on his first voyage over here) and a Desoto contact site in Arkansas.  We finally moved from Florida (after 18 years in Gainesville) to Maine (Bar Harbor) for 5 years for my wife to do a post-doc position (2000-2005) and moved to Birmingham, Alabama last year when she got a faculty position at the university here.  It's a surprisingly nice city, which I never would have considered living in before visiting.  We just bought a house (this morning!), and are looking forward to settling down for a while.  I stopped doing archaeology and now do data work for a cancer outreach project that tries to get folks in poor, rural African-American communities in Alabama and Mississippi to get screened for cancer.<br/>
<br/>
Gamewise, I started playing at 13 in 1976 with Empire of the Petal Throne.  I did eventually play some D&amp;D, but only for 4 years (AD&amp;D from 1978-1982), so my gaming experience is kinda different from most folks I meet.  I worked in a game store for 10 years during college and grad school (and sold Ron Edwards comics and games before he became a Big Time game designer).<br/>
<br/>
I've been sort of burned out on games for a while now and am trying to figure out what I really enjoy about gaming and why I haven't been able to get it for a long time.  I occasionally whine about it on an LJ.<br/>
<br/>
I have no apsirations to design games, but really, really appreciate the fact that the internet has made it possible to find a supportive community of interesting folks like you all.  I spend way too much time reading gaming fora and blogs.<br/>
<br/>
I don't understand computer games at all, although I did like mashing buttons while playing Soul Blade years ago, and can't for the life of me figure out what the draw is for mmorpgs or any computer "RPG" really.  I love serious anime, but know next to nothing about it.  I read Bronze Age archaeology for fun,   and my musical tastes are pretty eclectic (I'm trying hard to fill up a 40 gig iPod with everyting from Big Band to Nordic Roots to 80's New Wave to Tuvan Throat Singing to ...)<br/>

                            My name's Michael Curry, and I've never gotten the hang of the whole having a handle on the 'net thing, so I usually just go by some variant of my real name.  Sometimes I fear this implies a lack of imagination on my part.<br/><br/>I'm 39, single, and I've lived in New England all of my life.  I'm currently residing in a town in northeastern Connecticut that I don't feel especially attached to, but I can't see myself living anywhere other than the northeastern U.S.  At least until I have to flee the country.  I have a BA in Psychology, and I'm employed in the HR department of a faceless corporation that wants to destroy all life on Earth, or, as an alternative, sell them health insurance.  And since other people seem to be mentioning their religion, I'm an atheist.<br/><br/>I've been playing RPGs on and off since I was a teenager, first during the "usual" D&amp;D phase (though my first actual RPG purchase was a box of Runequest), followed by various homebrew fantasy games in college, then a period where I mainly gamed via the old Compuserve RPG Forum, followed by far too much Amber DRPG.  That last one might explain why I'm currently helping to run an Ambercon-like convention called <a href="http://www.theblackroad.com/" rel="nofollow">The Black Road</a> that's held outside Boston, MA.  I'm in two D&amp;D 3.5 campaigns at the moment, but I'd really like to actually be playing some of the fine indie RPGs I've bought over the past couple of years.  I'm not sure I see that happening in either of my current gaming groups.  I'm not currently past the mild tinkering stage of designing my own RPG, but that might change this year.<br/><br/>Other than RPGs, I read plenty of spec fic, something that's become an even bigger part of my life since I became friends with a talented literary agent who has taught me more than I ever thought I'd know about publishing.  Someday this might lead to a career change, but for now I'm just her faithful sidekick and permanent intern.  I also like to listen to a lot of music, which usually falls into either the category of <a href="http://ectoguide.org/" rel="nofollow">ectophilic</a> music or of Irish traditional music.  I'm currently learning how to play the tin whistle, and I'm thinking I might take up the flute at some point.<br/><br/>Oh, and I have far too many blogs, including one about <a href="http://www.of2minds.org/monkey/" rel="nofollow">gaming</a>, one about <a href="http://www.of2minds.org/wakeup/" rel="nofollow">politics</a> and one about <a href="http://www.of2minds.org/otm/" rel="nofollow">books/music/movies</a>.  None of them get updated as often as they should.<br/><br/>In case I haven't mentioned it before, I think this forum is just great.                        </div>

                            Okay, okay: Mike Sugarbaker, 30, unmarried, just moved to Portland OR to live with girl and cat. Administer and co-edit a website and podcast about RPGs as well as board games, card games and whatever else we are into. It's at <a href="http://www.ogrecave.com/" rel="nofollow">OgreCave.com</a> if you care. <br/><br/>Played redbox D&amp;D with my brother starting at age 8 (he was 11). Mostly couldn't keep my head in the game, even up until now. I'm embarrassed at how long it took me to realize why: "hey, all my brother's friends made fighters and I didn't, and I get bored when they have their three-hour combats. Hmm." So I'm very interested in games that might fulfill the promise of rich, interesting worlds and events that I always thought RPGs would get me. That, and <i>absolutely nothing else of any interest</i> is happening in games, for many reasons. Well, minis games are getting interesting, but back to the point: I ran Ghostbusters and learned how hard it is to notice when one of your players had the problem I had in my bro's D&amp;D games. I tried to run Teenagers From Outer Space once and learned how important it is for the PCs to want something. I ran Paranoia, mostly very successfully, and learned how to be flexible... or at least how to be in a lot of trouble when your railroading isn't effective enough. And then I kind of stopped with the RPGs and fell out of gaming until I got into CCGs in college.<br/><br/>Apart from gaming and the usual geekly spate of interests, I do web stuff for a living and hope to start a band again soon. I've tried my hand at game design a few times and have not completely ruled out attempting a new-style RPG. Lately, though, I've mostly been contributing to my honey's research of local happy hours. *hic*<br/><br/>I have been known to go by misuba. Free gift to anyone who can guess the etymology there.                        </div>

                            I'm James Holloway. I'm a 27-year old graduate student in archaeology; I have a little crude website about my research <a href="http://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/~jeh30" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I'm married to a fellow gamer -- three and a half years now, no kids. I was born in the UK, but my family moved to America when I was four. I grew up in the Bay Area, which is where I know Albert and his brother from, and I once picked up a recruiting note for John Kim's Vinland game off the board at Gamescape in Palo Alto, but I never followed it up. <br/><br/>I've been gaming since I was a little kid, always as kind of a way to give my nerdy creative dork-self some social status, but it's grown into a cool thing in my life, rather than my whole social context, which is nice. <br/><br/>Now I am back in the UK -- I live in Cambridge, where I read, write, teach, game, paint miniatures, and, er, read some more. As you can tell, I need to get more exercise. My research affords me the opportunity to travel some, which is really nice. <br/><br/>I think that's about it, really.                        </div>

                            Hello friends,<br/>
<br/>
I'm Andy Hopp. This is my first post on this forum, on account of I just joined. So, hello everyone.<br/>
<br/>
I work as an illustrator, writer, and game designer, but that's the work stuff and this thread is about personal stuff, so here it goes:<br/>
<br/>
I live in Akron, Ohio with my wife Heather and our 19 month old daughter Iliana. I'm 33 as of two weeks ago and I am freezing my wazoo off as I type this in my basement studio/office.<br/>
<br/>
I went to Kent State University where I majored in art and zoology (which influences my current job remarkably). Oh, I guess I majored in gaming too, since that's what I did more than homework.<br/>
<br/>
I am the con director for Con on the Cob (www.ConontheCob.com, if I may be allowed a shameless plug), to which you are all invited.<br/>
<br/>
That's about it for now. I'll come back when the feeling returns to my fingertips. Oh, Nathan Hill, if you're reading this, thanks for the nice comments about Low Life.  <br/>
<br/>
If anybody will be at GTS, Origins, Marcon, GenCon, or Con on the Cob stop by the art show and say hello.<br/>

Watching anime or other quality movies in most genres (last awesome movie watched: Millenium Actress!).<br/>
Sorting out the million idea in my head.<br/>

That about sums it up. Somehow I still schedule myself a few hours of sleep a day ;) and make up for it with espresso.<br/>

                            I'm Joe Murphy, about to turn 31, and I live in Scotland despite being Irish. I've travelled around a bit, and have had lots of odd jobs, from theatre work to chef. I have plenty of _skills_, just haven't found a job to settle in yet.<br/>
<br/>
Gaming started for me with the Fighting Fantasy solo adventure books, then ShadowRun, then Storyteller games. So D&amp;D anecdotes don't mean much to me. I bumped into the Forge back in 2002 or so, having had serious problems with gaming and having left my previous group.<br/>
<br/>
But I subsequently met some curious gamers (and curious non-gamers) in Edinburgh, and we've been trying a bunch of new things. Aswell as posting Actual Play reports, lots of out of game discussion, and so on. The Shadow of Yesterday is on tonight, whee!<br/>
<br/>
I've also found a few people locally who have an interest in design, so I'm hoping that our shared energy and enthusiasm will get some games off the ground. Bit like AA.<br/>
<br/>
Joe.                        </div>

<br/>
yeah, the "worked" in the states means worked in the business sense, sadly. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do after graduating, so I dicked around, working for a non-profit in San Francisco and then for a big internet firm in Redwood City (these being the days when you could get a decent-paying job in that field if you had a pulse). I had done some archaeology in my final year as an undergrad, but I didn't really get serious about it until I started my MA in Durham. I'm still kind of a weird hybrid of a historian and an archaeologist.                        </div>

                            I'm Alexander Cherry, publisher through the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.twistedconfessions.com" rel="nofollow">Twisted Confessions</a> label, which has put out such games as <b>Fastlane</b> and, through the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.nopress.net" rel="nofollow">No Press Anthology</a>, <b>Snowball</b>, which is also available free on my site.  There are other games out there that I've designed, but the only other one that's any good is <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.twistedconfessions.com/atheneum/ccimpact.php" rel="nofollow">Creeks and Crawdads: Revisited</a>, a homage to the original <b>Creeks and Crawdads</b>.  I have a number of other projects on my plate, which I'll talk about in other threads.<br/>
<br/>
Who am I outside of gaming?<br/>
<br/>
*I'm a Student Older than Traditional Age at <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.asu.edu" rel="nofollow">Arizona State University</a> where I plan on getting some combination of Economics and Mathematics major and minor (currently Math major/Econ minor, but that might switch, or they might both be majors).  I'm more excited by theory than application, or at least by abstract over concrete.<br/>
*I'm a hobby hypnotist with basic hypnotherapy certification.<br/>
*I'm an avid reader, though I don't read nearly as much as I used to.  Tragic.<br/>
*I'm a fan of the theatre, musical and otherwise, though I don't go as often as I should.  Again, tragic.<br/>
*I'm a motorcycle rider.  Currently, I own a Victory Vegas - 100 cubic inches of solid power. Haven't been behind the wheel of a car since I was 18.<br/>
*I've lived a significant length of time in 6 of the US States, and have been to over 30 of them, many during a 60-day bus trip around the country.  Also I've been to Canada, Mexico, Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Hungary, and some parts of the former Yugoslavia.<br/>
*I've been homeless.  I've also worked in telemarketing, customer service, spent several years as a security guard, and spent almost 5 years as a cubicle jockey.  Currently I'm focused entirely on school, so I'm not working.<br/>
*I'm a homeowner.  I am renting out two of my rooms to help pay for aforementioned schooling.<br/>
*I am single, potentially polyamorous, and surgically childfree.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, there's a good start as to Who I Am.                        </div>

                            Another Alexander, for your delectation.<br><br>I'm Alex, an English-Catalan (but shamefully monolingual) mutt.  I'm 27 and have recently finished up my PhD on the psychology of time and memory. Now I'm enjoying calling myself a <i>working</i> scientist: I'm employed on a project investigating how HIV affects the brain and cognitive function. London through and through, although I can see that changing in the future, most likely to Sweden or the (coastal) States.<br><br>I used to have cool hobbies to boast of: capoeira, singing in a rock/post-hardcore band, science and political blogging (ok, so I lied about the cool bit). A nasty and enduring back injury put paid to the first, the pressures of phd writing starved the last, and the band died as a consequence of the two cornering it in the rec room and gutting it with a shiv. Ah well. But, uh, I read! And watch movies! Hide your jealous faces.<br><br>Now we're onto fiction...<br>I was a massive consumer of sci-fi, fantasy, horror, comics and cult film from my single digits into my early twenties, interspersed with fitful periods into other stuff (from 19th-C Russian lit to police procedurals); for better or worse I don't now inhabit any genre particularly, but flit around all over the shop. Which is to say, I'm as consistent in my fictional interests as I am in other parts of my life - very much Jack(x) rather than Master(x), where <i>x</i> = trades. (Yes, I know that this makes a PhD a dumb vocational direction. No, I don't want to talk about it.)<br><br>The things that are constants in my life are my girl: amazing, beautiful, smart scientist; my family: copious and extended, fractious but vital; and my friends: a motley crew the bulk of whom I've known for 10-15 years. <br><br>Gaming has definitely <b>not</b> been a constant. I broke a 12-year abstinence this autumn past as a consequence of stumbling across indie games and discovering that more of my extended social group had a gaming history than I'd thought. Bit of a struggle scheduling at present but I'm slowly demolishing my regrown gaming virginity, one...no, even I'm repulsed by my metaphor. I'm getting to play, that's all.<br><br>Uh, I still blog, a little, with some tentative gaming stuff, <a href="http://farmerversusfox.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. You might also enjoy a nonsense skit on armour fashion sense I <a href="http://www.yankeepotroast.org/daily/040129.html" rel="nofollow">wrote</a> a while back. I'm a contributor to <a href="http://www.mindhacks.com/" rel="nofollow">Mindhacks</a>  (the blog and the book) but I've been lazy, lazy, lazy recently.<br><br/>[edited for inproper semicolon use. May god have mercy on us all.]                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            OK, time for me to ante up and kick in. I have a tendency to run my mouth so I will try to keep it short.<br/>
<br/>
I'm Mike Montesa. When my mom gets angry at me, she calls me, "Michael John Montesa!" The family name is Spanish by way of the Philippines, though I was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay area (El Cerrito to be exact). The rest of the family is Dutch, Italian, and Mexican, and when I get around to having kids, we get to add Japanese into the mix (my wife, Emi, is Japanese though I think she's sort of a human/panda mix). My at-home conversations resemble Andy's as well (which get weirder when I speak Greedo to her and she speaks Han Solo to me).<br/>
<br/>
I'm 38, and for 15 of those years I've taught English in Japan. This is coming to an end this year however, as Emi and I are pulling up stakes and returning to the U.S. To make a long story short, I'm due for a career change and it's time to move.<br/>
<br/>
I'm obsessed with gaming. I think about it *a lot.* Been playing since I was 12 and started with AD&amp;D1e like everyone else. Was big into Warhammer FRP and Shadowrun for many years, and now I drift from game to game looking for the perfect meld of rules and setting. I run games more than I play them. Got turned onto indie games about 2 years ago and I'm in awe of some of the stuff that's coming out these days and despairing of my inability to ever create something like The Mountain Witch, Polaris, or DitV.<br/>
<br/>
I have freelanced for a couple of publishers, most recently GWG/PEG, writing the Weird War Two setting for their Savage Worlds line. Working on that, with its gamist (my understanding of the term) focus, has got me seriously trying to come up with a WW2 RPG that isn't Advanced Squad Leader disguised as an RPG. So far, I keep getting blown away as soon as the landing ramp goes down and scrapping whatever ideas I've got since they just seem to suck.<br/>
<br/>
I could blather on some more, but I will stop. If you want to actually *hear* me blather on some more (god help you), check out the Godzilla Gaming Podcast!<br/>

                            Hey all,<br/><br/>I visit story-games kinda irregularly and this is my first post here.<br/><br/>My name is, as in my username, Ivan Dervisevic, I have lived in yugoslavia/serbia and montenegro for my whole life. 22 years old.<br/>I'm getting a degree in theoretical Computer science, which would be something like a major in math or CS and a minor in the other. I *love* RPGs, started playing them in the 4th grade (11,12 years old?) with ad&amp;d e2 and then,... RIFTS... I am currently trying to get a Polaris group together. I hope.<br/><br/>I just recently (somewhat less than a year) discovered the Forge, cool indie games and joined up with the people from indienetgaming where I try to get in a game sometimes. Mostly I use iLikeSpoons as my nickname.<br/><br/>Whate else, that is fun? I traveled through a large part of Europe as an exemplary highschool (and now university) student. I fell in love with Norway and plan to live there, if at all possible (yay for graduate degree scholarships). <br/>I am really, really in love with my camera (that I am still learning to use properly), but I almost never get the time to put up my photos online... a small selection is on my flickr account:<br/><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ilikespoons" rel="nofollow">Here</a><br/><br/>I also collect and paint minis, mostly the lovely, lovely Rackham stuff. <br/>I haven't and don't plan to write any rpg material soon.<br/><br/>I'm also a huge BSG and Whedon fanboy right now.<br/><br/>and, well, that's enough rambling for now.                        </div>

                            Hi, I'm Per Fischer, 42-year-old Dane residing in Edinburgh, Scotland. Married to Susanne and we are raising two great kids, 13 and 16 (nearly 17).<br/>
<br/>
I've had a hard time finding similar minded roleplayers since moving to Scotland, but luckily I have found a few, one of which is Joe from this forum.<br/>
<br/>
I have been writing convention scenarios since 1993 and am moving to get my game design ideas out in the open. I have a couple of elderly teaching degrees in Music and History as well as a brand spanking new in Journalism. I write anything. Comic scripts, animation, feature articles, reviews, business plans, you blimming name it. Maybe even rp games.<br/>
<br/>
Most of my time is wasted at a job-type job doing tech support.<br/>

                            Since I just registered here today, I guess I should post here, too...<br/>
<br/>
I'm Joshua M. Neff. I'm 36 years old. I identify as Irish and Jewish, but I'm really mostly of Secular Humanist Left-Wing Activist Eastern European Jewish descent, with some other stuff (including Secular Left-Wing Irish) thrown in. By that, I mean that no one in my family has ever really gone to temple or church (my great-grandmother apparently used to spit on the ground whenever she saw a rabbi, being the good Marxist that she was), although my parents got involved in the Unitarian-Universalist church while involved in the Civil Rights Movement, and I grew up going to UU church. (I don't go to church anymore, and my father, who was a UU minister throughout my youth, has since quit and disowned the church. See, there isn't a religion liberal enough for my family.)<br/>
<br/>
I post on the Forge and RPGnet (although not much lately) under the same username as here, and occasionally make fairly pointless comments and marginalia asides on Anyway as "jmn." I currently live in Olathe, KS (which is now in the ever-expanding greater Kansas City Metro area), but have lived all over the place, including Detroit, Long Island, Iowa City, Chapel Hill, England, Ecuador, Japan, and Milwaukee. I'm a reference librarian at my local public library (which I love like I've never loved any other job). I'm married to a beautiful, witty, wacky, geeky, sexy, moody redhead, Julie, and have adopted (well, not legally--yet) her beautiful, brilliant, nerdy daughter, Morgan, who just turned 9. I've been gaming since I was 10. Julie is also a gamer, going back to high school, although she's much more sporadic about it than I am. I've recently inducted Morgan into the world of RPGs, playing a one-on-one game using the rules of The Shadow of Yesterday adapted to the setting of S. John Ross' Uresia.<br/>
<br/>
Apart from playing with my daughter, though, I've been taking something of a break from playing RPGs. I've found, though, that I really can't let them go, which is why I registered here.<br/>
<br/>
Besides playing RPGs and other games and being a librarian, husband and father, I also write (mostly fiction these days--I'm currently working on a hero pulp adventure novel that I intend to serialize on my website) and spend way too much time on-line.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I've recently taught myself how to tie a proper bow tie, which I'm very proud of. My profile picture here is me showing that off. Yes, I wear bow ties to work.<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I actually type that my Marxist great-grandmother spit on the ground when she saw a "rabbit" rather than a "rabbi"--and no one noticed! But I fixed the typo anyway.                        </div>

                            Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I'm Christoph Boeckle, living between Lausanne and DelÃƒÂ©mont, in Switzerland. I mainly speak french, but having grown up near Zurich I also speak swiss german. I learned english during a three year stay in Ennis, Ireland (I love that country btw). I speak a few words of italian and understand it pretty well.<br/>
<br/>
Currently I'm slowly turining 23 and studying physics in Lausanne, with a big interest in astrophysics.<br/>
<br/>
Apart from RPGs, I enjoy all sorts of litterature and movies. I also listen to a lot of metal style music (favorites include Isis, Arcturus, My Dying Bride...), weird stuff (Godspeed, Ulver, Max Richter...) and enjoy going to electronic music parties (from trance to hardcore to drum'n'bass).<br/>
I sometimes write short stories (in french).<br/>
I occasionaly enjoy playing board games (especially Tigris &amp; Euphrates).<br/>
<br/>
I like getting into all sorts of associations (the one running the school bar for instance and I also co-organize Switzerland's biggest RPG con, plus a few other little things)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I lurk around a lot on blogs and forums (also on indienetgaming which is really neat), sometimes going by the nick of Artanis or Boeck. Other than that, I'll leave the rpg details for other threads.                        </div>

                            I'm Garett and I post here and elsewhere under "Old Scratch".<br/>
<br/>
I'm in my early '30s and have been involved in education for some time as both a student and teacher. I'm a trained historian and anthropologist with a focus on Africa and gender issues and I split my time between the States and the UK.<br/>
<br/>
Interests: vegetarian cooking, gardening and guerrilla gardening, reading, foreign and indie films, and gaming (predictably)!<br/>
<br/>
Here, I suppose I represent the user end of gaming, whereas many people here are from the design and production end. I really got into gaming with the gaming books like Fighting Fantasy (I remember the first one I ever saw: The Forest of Doom and can recall with perfect clarity passages and images from the book as I experienced them...) and gradually started buying into games... Probably one of the first books I bought was the Mines of Moria for MERP. I spend maybe a hundred hours sifting over that supplement and imagining things long before I even bought the book. It's funny now, because I find reading anything like that now exceedingly difficult!<br/>
<br/>
I started off quite conventional: playing Robotech and buying early D&amp;D stuff, before I found my main stay of WFRP which I wrote a lot of crap for. A lot. Gradually, I started running games without character sheets, hidden mechanics with the focus on activities, that sort of thing and gradually began experimenting with Hogshead's NewStyle games like the Baron, Pantheon, Puppetland and the like. As I've headed in this direction, my long-time gaming group (12 years plus) seems to be heading in a different direction...<br/>
<br/>
And here I am now, finally having found something in roleplaying that better meets my need of telling more compelling stories. I think its an incredibly exciting and innovative time in role playing for many of us, and the internet gaming community has really become a fertile garden for innovation.<br/>
<br/>
My goal is here to continue to be inspired. There's a lot of great conversation going on here with a lot of enthusiasm and courtesy, and ultimately I hope to share and contribute some of my own ideas and enthusiasm with you.                        </div>

I work as a technology specialist, doing computer stuff, currently at insurance sector.<br/><br/>I've been roleplaying since 1987, both tabletop and live-action roleplaying. I don't live in Turku, but I've been influenced (or the other way around).

                            Before I begin I would like to say that I really dig this community. I've haunted many boards and this one is the only one that feels like a community. <br/>
<br/>
My nick and my name are the same. I'm living in Springfield, Virginia, having recently moved here from Seattle where I lived just a block away from Pagan Publishing. <br/>
<br/>
I am presently one of two partners of Sixteen Coal Black Horses. We publish the Battleaxe RPG, a free fantasy RPG. <br/>
<br/>
I recently graduated from Cornish in Seattle where they eventually decided to award me with a BFA. I concentrated on video and photo, but tried, unsuccessfully, to major in RPG design.<br/>
<br/>
My first real gig in the game industry was as one of two designers working on one of the designs being considered for a Wheel of Time card game. Our design has never seen the light of day as the contract was eventually awarded to Mayfair, but our little design earned the interest of Mr. Jordan himself.<br/>
<br/>
Bolstered by that near-success I, and my business partner, decided to try our hand at an RPG. We worked in our spare time while trying to raise our respective families and work full time. Needless to say, it was a long, painful exercise that ended in a ruined marriage and the death (or, at least, deep coma) of the game (World Bazaar, aka Archena Roleplaying). The trauma of that time still haunts that game. I can barely muster the will to speak its name for fear of summoning that time. <br/>
<br/>
The frustration of that experience fueled the desire to 'get something out there.' The end result was the Battleaxe RPG, a game put together in just a couple of weeks. It felt good to get something done and I put it on the web as a free game. Very soon, one download a day became 20 downloads a day, and, before I knew it, people were writing me to tell me how much they liked the game.<br/>
<br/>
I applied at a job with Mythic Entertainment citing Battleaxe as prior game experience. The guy who hired me is an avid roleplayer and seemed impressed with Battleaxe. I was hired as a content developer on Imperator. After Imperator was put on hold I accepted a position on the Warhammer Online (WAR) team as lead quest designer. I am now working as lead quest designer and as one of two lead content developers for WAR.<br/>
<br/>
Battleaxe opened many doors and it continues to teach me valuable lessons. I discovered that design doesn't need to feel like giving birth, but can be loose and organic. I learned that the sacred has no place in design and that the only thing that matters is the vision.<br/>
<br/>
I am currently working on a second edition of Battleaxe, Black Sunshine -- a little post-apocalypse game that may or may not see release, and am working to publish the strange ramblings of Dr. Jack Roman in an effort called Project Gamma Ray (although that has hit a few snags that may prevent its release).<br/>
<br/>
I first discovered tabletop roleplaying back in '83 with Stormbringer. That led to Call of Cthulu and then Elfquest. I played a little Star Frontiers, Middle Earth Roleplaying, Marvel Superheroes, and Twilight 2000, but I really started to love roleplaying when I got into Palladium. That led to TMNT and then, of course Rifts. I didn't really like the system of any one of them and the roleplaying group I was in started tinkering and seeing what we could put together. We created a Star Wars and GI Joe RPG sometime in '86 and had a blast playing that for a few years. We would photocopy the rules and hand them out to other friends. We even started leaving stacks of them at our local hobby store.<br/>
<br/>
These days I don't get enough time to roleplay. There just doesn't seem to be the time. Most recently I had to turn down a Rifts campaign. It nearly broke my heart to say, "No, I can't play."                        </div>

                            Doug, I'd just like to say, the stuff you put on the web for free has better graphic design than most in-print games. And I think it's way cool that putting a free game up on the web helped land you gainful employment. Rock on!                        </div>

A year ago I got a BA from U Mass, Amherst; double-majored in biology and Western Civ (a lot of medieval studies). Right now I work at a community college, tutoring students in math, but I'm applying to graduate schools.<br/><br/>Besides gaming, I go hiking,  read non-fiction, play around with blacksmithing, and do miscellaneous computer stuff (including a little freelance web/graphic design, but I don't pretend I'm really good). I practice some historical European martial arts; specifically Renaissance German longsword. I'm an atheist.<br/><br/>I don't game as much as I like, but I have found people who like indie games.<br/><br/>I'm currently (at this moment) listening to Spoon's "Kill the Moonlight."                        </div>

                            Well, been here for a week, today posted my first couple of posts.<br/><br/>I'm the third Israeli to post here.

                            I'm Danny K, full name Dan Krashin.  <br/>
<br/>
I live in Seattle, which I like very much even though it's dark and overpriced and rainy.  I'm Jewish, although I also have strong Buddhist leanings.  I'm also a psychiatrist, which makes me a big ol' walking stereotype.  When I grow a beard, I look like somebody's rabbi grandfather.<br/>
<br/>
I'm 38, so I played D&amp;D in the blue box after I read about it in the cover story in "Psychology Today", also Top Secret, Gamma World, and so on.  Later I lived overseas wtih my family and spent a lot of time gaming with grown men, soldiers who were avid gamers in their time off.  I played a whole lot of crunchy gamist games like Rolemaster and Arduin Grimoire, which eventually drove me out of the hobby for about ten years.  <br/>
<br/>
About four years ago, a friend of mine got me interested in Vampire: the Masquerade, and that pulled me into White Wolf gaming.  After some years of Werewolf, Vampire, and Mage, especially Mage, and spending a lot of time on Ex Libris Nocturnis, I found RPG.Net and discovered a whole new world of gaming.  <br/>
<br/>
I got very obsessed with Nobilis for a while, also discovered Sorcerer and from that found the Forge, have had my ups and downs with the Forge and now try to post judiciously, once in a while.  I've tried lots of different games, and now I've settled pretty much on Wushu and PTA as my favorites, only playing other games when there's a good reason  to do so.  <br/>
<br/>
I like thinking about and playing with game mechanics, but I don't have the interest or stamina to be a full-fledged game designer.  I'd like there to be more games like Sorcer or Dogs where you can tinker at the edges to "roll your own" version without starting from scratch.  <br/>
<br/>
I like hiking and travelling, too, but that's probably enough out of me.  I'm happy to see a lot of familiar faces on this site, including folks like Neel, Shreyas, John Kimj, and Paka who are always stretching my mind with their ideas and their play.  Oh, fun fact: I'm the only person I've ever met who has GOODLIFE tatooed on them.  It's a reference to Saberhagen's "Berserkers" novels, but nobody ever gets that.                        </div>

                            Hey all,
<p><br/>I am a woman of mostly Irish descent living in Toronto, Ontario, Canada where I was born, 33 years ago. I'm married to Brand who wooed me in RPG about 8 years ago... and then made me wait five an a half years before getting his damn ass up here from California. We were married on a yacht on Lake Ontario in the summer of 2004, and he landed with full permanent resident status this last November. I don't think I've ever been happier. We have no kids, but might adopt someday.<br/></p><p><br/>I have a BA in English and Cultural Studies from Trent University in Peterborough Ontario where I was a crazy theatre geek and all around nogoodnik freak. My mother was sure I'd be dependent on her until her pension ran out, but two weeks after graduation I got a job for a major telecommunications company to pay my student loans. Ten years later, against all odds (and frequently my best instincts!) I'm now a Business and Systems Analyst in the IT wing of the company.<br/></p><p><br/>Besides the stint at school I've spent most of my life in Toronto. I lived on international assignment in Brazil (Sao Paulo, Campinas, Rio, and Macae) for six months at the start of the millenium. I'm politically leftist, spiritually complicated, and morbidly introspective.<br/></p><p><br/>Hobbywise, I started playing D&amp;D at the York Quay Harbourfront Centre when I was 7, which made my mom happy because it kept me out of her hair for hours at a time on Saturday afternoons. It didn't make her so happy, however,  when I was killed  (while fighting the giant crab in White Plume Mountain) and ressurected, given a title of nobility. I've never had confirmation from my catholic mom that this was the reason I didn't go back, but I'd say it was a safe bet. <br/></p><p><br/>I came back to gaming in university when a fellow actor asked me to audition for a serial improv  "soap" based on VtM but before Mind's Eye, and performed in front of a live theatre audience. I continued to rp through school, but play far more often now than I ever did then. I think it has, in many ways, takenthe place in my life that theatre used to fill. I'm a heavy immersion player (that maintains full authorial control), and I have a strong emotional socket in the characters I play.<br/></p><p><br/>I did a number of books for Tribe 8 a couple of years ago, and learned quickly that there was little reward, either monitarily or emotionally from the process. <br/>Now I'm interested in design, have a blog over on <a href="http://www.spaceanddeath.com/sin_aesthetics/" rel="nofollow">Sin Aesthetics</a> in which I periodically blather about the stuff I'm interested in. I just finished <i>Crime &amp; Punishment</i> in the Game Chef, which I think I did as a kind of calisthetic brain preparation for finishing <i>1000 Stories</i>, the game Brand and I working on together. I also have a couple of ideas kicking around in the back of my head that I hope will make it to fruition one day.<br/></p><p><br/> I tend to come and go with my time and focus, so if you ever want me to respond to something that I seem to have missed, feel free to mail me or post over on my blog.<br/></p><p><br/>Outside of RPG's, I make leather molded masks, and am teaching myself to draw. I goof around with graphic design and create crazy elaborate character sheets. I have also recently gotten involved with Habitat for Humanity.<br/></p><p><br/>I'm also, apparently, overly verbose.</p> </div>

                            I'm Chris Rogers, I'm twenty-four, and I'm currently living with my wife in Japan.  I used to live in Athens, Georgia, but after twenty years, I felt like some change was overdue.  When I graduated from college, I was accepted to the Japanese Exchange and Teaching Program, so I've moved about as far from Georgia as you can get.  It's quite an experience.<br/>
<br/>
I miss tacos*.<br/>
<br/>
I've been playing RPGs for about 13 years, starting with the second edition of WEG's Star Wars.  Truthfully, I had read an article in Games Magazine about AD&amp;D 2nd edition a few years before I purchased that book, and had bought dice and devised a couple of rudimentary RPGs on my own.  My progression went something like this: Diceless Homebrew --&gt; Star Wars --&gt; GURPS --&gt; White Wolf --&gt; TONS OF STUFF.  My wife does play RPGs, so I get some gaming in (most notably The Pool/Puddle, Trollbabe, HeroQuest, and TSoY), but I really miss being able to play with a larger group.<br/>
<br/>
Outside of games, my interests include linguistics (my major of study in college), Japanese language, jazz saxophone, cooking (despite being rather terrible at it and having a shitty sense of smell), long walks on the beach, and I want to be loved by you.  Sounds good to ya, don't it?<br/>
<br/>
*ahem*<br/>
<br/>
When I get back to the states in about a year and a half, I am planning on going to grad school and hopefully making my way to some big (or even little) cons so I can meet the people behind the posts.<br/>
<br/>
I've got a million and a half ideas floating around in my head about games, campaigns, techniques, mechanics and the like, and hopefully I'll get some out on paper in a format that someone wants to read one of these days.  While I work on that, I consume any RPG theory related stuff I can without giving myself a headache.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Actually, I miss the Cheesy Gordita Crunch, the miraculous ambrosia bestowed upon the common man by the god-king Taco Bell.  It's probably the thing that I can't get here that I miss the most, and don't ever let me tell you any different.                        </div>

                            I'm Jessica Hammer, I'm 29, and I'm very new here, so, uh, hi.  I'm told you don't bite.  Please let that be true.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br><br>I'm a graduate student at Columbia in their new game research lab, looking at role-playing and narrative creativity.  This means that I basically spend my time role-playing, playing computer games, talking to role-players, watching other people play computer games, and the like.  It's a pretty sweet situation, except the grad-student impoverishedness. <br><br>Most of my actual income comes from teaching game design, consulting about games and play, and building games on the side.  My first role-playing credit was for writing on <i>Deliria</i>, last year, but I've done computer games, card games, and a massively-multiplayer board game, too.  (The consulting stuff pays way better than the game design, though!)  My eventual goal is to be a full-time academic, but working on "design research" which means that I can design games and then publish about them.<br><br>I live in New York City with my boyfriend, too many cats, and a small personal library.  The boy's a Java programmer; we take turns supporting each other while one of us is unemployed or in school, and right now he's my rock and my compass.  He's also my favorite collaborator.<br><br> I've got a brilliant, fantastic group of eccentrics as my RP group, including some of the most talented artists and musicians I've been fortunate enough to meet.  We keep meaning to get down to hang out with the nerdnyc folks, but, um, yeah.  We'll get there at some point!<br><br>In my (not nearly copious enough) free time, I read, read, read, read, read.  I get obsessed with particular topics at times (ancient Rome, cryptography, travel writing), but mostly I'm a fiction junkie.  If it's got a good story, I'll read it, watch it, play it, listen to it, improvise it or just plain make it up.  <br><br>I also volunteer for an animal rescue and do mentoring for women entering the game development field.  I study Spanish and take Tae Kwon Do.  I love to cook but hate to wash dishes.  I am an ardent feminist, an semi-observant Jew and a passable programmer.  I'm just getting involved in improv theater, and wondering why I didn't do so years ago.<br><br>I've got a bunch of personal game design projects going on, including a couple of card games and two role-playing projects.  I've got a website at <a href="http://www.replayable.net" rel="nofollow">replayable.net</a>, but right now nothing much is up there.  If you want to get a look at what I'm working on, I put together <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/Decade.php" rel="nofollow">Decade</a> for the Game Chef contest.  On the non-roleplaying front, my team just won the <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/mar2006/id20060317_074043.htm" rel="nofollow">Mobile Game Mosh</a>, a 24-hour game design and development competition.  That and other projects should be up at replayable eventually (i.e. when I finally finish the *<a href="/forums/profile/%23%26amp">@#&amp;</a>;$ book chapter I'm writing!).<br><br>I'm quite shy about meeting people in the community, but I recognize a lot of the names here, even if I haven't met most of you.  Hello, smart people.  I'm looking forward to playing with you.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

I got into gaming when I was 10, gamed until I went to university and then really dropped out for lack of time and interest. I kept reading gaming material for games I loved, but never had much enthusiasm for tabeltop gaming. <br/>

I got back into it when Issaries relased Hero Wars, because suddenly I found a game that worked for me as I was now. The Forge really helped me to see why, but I still feel I am on the journey back from the habits I learned to new ones. Now I play every week again.                        </div>

My name is John Laviolette, which is why you occasionally see a few people here call me "John L." I'm 42 ad thought I was the oldest gamer here, but it looks like Thor and Shawn got me beat. The number of 40+ people here suprises me.<br/>
<br/>
Ethnically, I'm pretty mixed, mostly Scots Irish, French, and Cherokee. Geographically, I was born near Sacramento, California and have lived here most of my life, but grew up in Rantoul, Illinois (which isn't that far from the Champaign-Urbana area where Stuart lives.) There were stopovers in Hawaii, Colorado, Wisconsin and Oklahoma as well. <br/>
<br/>
This means that i was in Illinois in the early '70s, where I was introduced to a weird variant of brown-box D&amp;D (someone had renamed Wisdom to Piety and added a spell point system.) I played several other games since then and tried designing a couple, then kind of set that aside and started thinking about creating setting materials until I discovered the Forge and wound up getting seriously into game design.<br/>
<br/>
I don't get to actually play much lately. I see the guy I played Traveller and D&amp;D with almost every week, but he's too busy to game these days, while the people I played Tibet/Fates Worse Than Death/In Dark Alleys with moved up to Eureka (not far from Arcata, where Ben grew up,) so I only game with them about three times a year. I get most of my gaming in conventions, which I only started to go to in the last two years.<br/>
<br/>
My big time eater isn't roleplaying, it's writing, video and music. I'm apparently the only person here who is into experimental music/noise, so it doen't mean much to anyone when I say I perform noise and have tracks on a couple comp CDs. I also  compose lyrics and arrangements with friends as part of that insane humorous band InterrÃƒÂ¶bang Cartel that I've mentioned before.<br/>
<br/>
I also like to travel, when I have spare funds. I visit friends in Boston, Providence, and DC about once a year and made it to England twice. Aside from visiting friends on these trips, I also take in historic and bizarre local sites.<br/>
<br/>
Professionally, I work in tech support. Familywise, I've never been married and have no kids, and though I would like both of those things, I've come to the conclusion that it's better for someone of my personality to stay single..<br/>
<br/>
This is already far more than I've ever written about myself, so I guess I'll stop here.                        </div>

                            Hi -- I'm Joshua Kronengold, Aka mneme, mnemex, mnemesys, Josh, Joshua, or Josh K, or Joshua K (but not Josh Kronengold).  I'm 34.<br/>
<br/>
I don't have a lot of industry cred -- a UA writing credit, a bunch of playtest credit, and some design credit for Shadowfist (the hong-kong movie CCG).  I've been a contributor to the venerable RPG APA Alarums and Excursions for over 12 years.  And I've got two livejournals -- a personal one, mnemex and a gaming livejournal I share with Lisa Padol, labcats.  I live in Queens, NYC, but work and spend most of my time in Manhatten.<br/>
<br/>
I'm into RPGs (Theatre Style LARPs, quasi-freeform and indy RPGs), sf and fantasy, sf fandom and filk music, board and card gaming (which I play with the Columbia Games Club on most friday evenings), the CCG Shadowfist, and perl.  I've been into, but am currently not really active in historical and classical fencing, the SCA,, and origiami.<br/>
<br/>
I'm partnered with Lisa Padol, and have done most of my recent RPG play with her.  We're currently doing a PBEM set in her older-than-a-decade long campaign, Cthulhupunk, Messages in a Bottle, a letter game with (currently) three players (readable here: http://labcats.org/pipermail/bottle_labcats.org/ ), Lisa's Sorceror game, playing in Beth Bartley's recently re-activated Hub game (SF, OTE rules, James Schmitz's hub as setting), and playing in a friend's D&amp;D3.5 game.<br/>
<br/>
I'll occasionally get the urge to design something.  Usually, I sit quietly until it passes; occasionally it will get loose (which is why you'll find some LARP mechanics on the labcats journal).  Maybe some day I'll do something more coherent.  In the same way, I'll occasionally get the urge to write a song, usually, though not always, to someone else's tune.                        </div>

<p>John L,</p>
<p>I'm <em>really</em> interested to know more about this D&amp;D variant with Piety and spell points, since that's the system that was used by the computer game Wizardry. (1981) I always thought it was an odd thing to change from "real" D&amp;D, it didn't occur to me that it might have a P&amp;P antecedent, but I suppose it makes sense.</p>

                            Hello all, here is a collection of random facts about me.<br/><br/>I'm Drew.  I live just outside North London in the UK.  I'm 30 and live with my troo love Jen and a roguishly delinquent cat called Zoe.  Despite what you may believe about any other felines in your acquaintance, <i>my</i> cat actually is the most beautiful cat in the world.  This is a scientific fact, I can prove it with an etchasketch.<br/><br/>I was born and grew up in London, so naturally, whilst I hate the place in many ways I can't bring myself to live too far away.  Hertfordshire is a good compromise:  nice countryside and not too polluted and dirty, but only 30 mins from the centre of the Big Smoke.  <br/><br/>My job is "technical support coordinator" in a large college.  It's pretty good.  I used to work in TV production until I realised I don't like being exploited by assholes.<br/><br/>I like old classic cars, and have 2 currently which I am attempting to restore and hope to rally one day.  A 1968 Triumph Herald 1200 (runs, used daily) and a 1973 BMW 3.0si (sat in a garage awaiting major work).  I had a Ford Capri 2.8i Special too, but I had to sell it (*sob*) as I couldn't really afford them all.<br/><br/>My favourite movies are in no particular order:  The Big Lebowski, Withnail and I, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou and The Princess Bride.<br/><br/>I like reading; favourite authors at the mo are: Greene, Ballard, Dostoevsky, Vonnegut, Le Guin also just getting in to Le Carre.<br/><br/>I've not published anything in the RPG world, although I'm working on a couple of designs.<br/><br/>Lots of people think I look like Dr Green from ER, that's cool but the resemblance is superficial only: I am slightly balding and have the same beard.<br/><br/>Anyway, that about it for now.<br/><br/>Drew                        </div>

<p>Experimental Music, what sorts? (Ears perking up)</p>

<p>I guess you could describe my stuff as a cross between musique concrete and algorithmic music used to create ambient sound textures. Except that I use a lot of delay and effects, because I mostly play in settings where the preferred styles are tablecore, power electronics, free jazz, and percussive or drone pieces. I'm getting harsher all the time.</p>

<p>I'm <em>really</em> interested to know more about this D&amp;D variant with Piety and spell points, since that's the system that was used by the computer game Wizardry.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I don't recall all the details and might have a slightly skewed version of the system. A friend of mine was in some kind of remedial math class in junior high; the teacher used his modified version of D&amp;D as a teaching tool. My friend then ran D&amp;D games with me and one other person and I was able to get copies of his spell lists, saving throw tables, monster tables, etc., which I later discovered were exact copies of the tables in the original rulebooks, so I was playing D&amp;D without ever seeing either the original books or the full house rules this teacher had created.</p>
<p>As far as i recall, this system renamed Wisdom as Piety and otherwise kept clerics the same. However, as I've thought it over, I'm wondering if Piety was a separate score and I'm just forgetting how he used Wisdom.</p>
<p>The spell system was the exact same spell list, but instead of memorizing individual spells, you had so many points of "Magical Conductivity". Every use of a first-level spell cost something like 1d4 points of Magical Conductivity, second level cost 1d6 or thereabouts, with the range and at some point the number of dice increasing for each spell level. We played this way in either '75 or '76, since it was before I went to junior high myself and my friend was a year ahead of me.</p>

I'm a 30 year old systems admin, living in Burbank, CA with my partner Stacey and the rest of our postmodern family.  We're rapidly approaching the final planning stages of having kids.  <br/>

I've been role playing and gaming pretty regularly since about 12, and I've got a few games currently in design, but for the most part I think I've yet to make any lasting mark in the hobby at large.  Yet.                        </div>

                            (Apologies for the necromancy, but I'm having such a good time here that I wanted to post.)<br/>
<br/>
My name is Mark Delsing, though my username "buzz" is actually a genuine meatspace nickname I've had since about '97 or so. It's also my username on ENworld, RPG.net, The Forge, Hero Games' forum, and other places I've probably forgotten about.<br/>
<br/>
I'm a soon-to-be 36-year-old living in Aurora, IL and work for OfficeMax as a UI Designer. I'm married to Earth' Greatest Wife; she's teaches high school. We have no kids; just a dog and cat. My dad is Punjabi and my mother is German, which makes me... an American. I went to <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.bard.edu/" rel="nofollow">Bard College</a> in upstate NY and received both a BA in English and a massive pile of debt. I grew up in Skokie/Evasnton, IL, and lived in Boston for a while after college.<br/>
<br/>
I started RPG'ing in 1981 with the original Moldvay Basic D&amp;D set (no dice, just "chits"). I played mostly AD&amp;D1e and V&amp;V in high school, moving to Rolemaster, Call of Cthulhu, and Champions in college. Then came the Great Dark TimeÃ¢â€žÂ¢ from about '91 to '01 when I didn't really game much at all. Then 3e came out, and there was much rejoicing. Since then, I have gamed more often and more regularly than at any point in my life previous.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, I am in three biweekly groups: all-D&amp;D, mostly-D&amp;D, and HERO. I also act as organizer and pimp-type-guy for <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://gameday.buzzmo.com/" rel="nofollow">ENWorld Chicago Gameday</a>.<br/>
<br/>
It was a few months ago that I somehow happened upon Chris Chinn's blog, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://bankuei.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Deep in the Game</a>, which is now a daily stop for me. This initiated a snowball effect that eventually got me thoroughly converted to Forge theory and interested in indie RPGs. I hope to actively play more of them in the future.<br/>
<br/>
I have no published RPG credits, though I did get a letter printed in <i>Dragon</i> once.<br/>
<br/>
Outside of gaming, I like to record <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.bhtch.com/index.php" rel="nofollow">relatively offensive yet humorous rock music</a>. I read a lot, though lately it's been mostly game texts and graphic novels. My "Joss Whedon is my master now" t-shirt is a prized possession. My wife and I rarely go out to the movies anymore, but Netflix and Buffy/Angel DVDs (see above) are our close friends. Oh, I'm a dedicated Mac user, too.                        </div>

                            Wow - I totally missed this thread. Here goes:<br><br>I am 28, married, with an almost-three-year-old daughter (Hilde) &amp; a just-turned-one son (Enoch). I'm in Centreville, VA, where I work as a software engineer/web developer for a smallish defense contractor. Degree is in CS, from George Mason University nearby here.<br><br>I like to garden a bit, like to cook (and eat!), watch a lot of film, and read books on everything from salt to Rastafarianism to mythology to whatever. I'm active at my church (Mormon), which is part of what piqued my interest in Dogs in the Vineyard and from there I got interested in all kinds of story-gaming. I also like boardgames and just started CRPGing in WoW.<br><br>I started roleplaying sometime in the late 80s when I found my sister's old copy of the D&amp;D 1E Players Handbook, and have played off and on (mostly on) since then, largely with the same small group of gamers, and almost all D&amp;D, with a little Marvel Superheroes &amp; Star Wars back in the day. Now I GM, and I'm pressing for more indie-gaming. It's going to be lots of fun.<br><br>I havent designed any full games, but I have a couple of ideas brewing and a few thoughts on mechanics &amp; such. I also have a cool idea for an online gamehelp application that I'm excited to start working on. <br><br>I've never met any of you in person, yet.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Didn't know about this thread. Buzz can resurrect the thing, and I'll feed it some brains.<br><br>I'm Doyce Alan Testerman, and I'm surprised how many of you people I know.<br><br>I started gaming back around the time that E.T. came out in theatres, I think.  DnD red box. I was about 10. I didn't know what the hell I was doing, but I did it.  Got the hang of AD&amp;D in high school.<br/><br/>Played Ad&amp;D and Shadowrun and Champs and d6 Star Wars and WarhammerFRP and Dangerous Journeys and about a dozen other things in college.  I also started playing and coding mushes back then.  I put up my first web page (bears-cave, which I still own the .com for) in '91 or '92.  I also got married back at that point, for about a month.  Let's just pretend that didn't happen.<br/><br/>I bought AmberDRPG in somehting like 1994 and it blew my tiny little mind.  Started running a game before I'd even found the Amber books.  Started reading the Amber Mailing List (which would be when I first 'met' Arref and Iago (that crazy bastard who wrote about running Amber using FUDGE) and keeping a web page for my Amber stuff, which is still up.<br/><br/>Moved to Denver in 1995.  Started another Amber game and coding on a MUSH on which I met Adam.  I gave up mush and mud games a little later.  Ran d20 for awhile, for the old-skool.<br/><br/>I got very very tired of the ADRPG 'system', got into Nobilis for awhile (which I still really like). It was on that mailing list where I first read stuff by Tony LB, I think (and I think I was one of the folks telling him to get his butt over to the Forge).<br/><br/>Since the Forge infected my brain, I've run Sorcerer, Paladin, TSoY, Inspectres, Trollbabe, Heroquest alot, DitV a little, and I own a bunch of other things like Donjon and Universalis and Capes and (most recently) Don't Rest Your Head and Nine Worlds.  I need to get With Great Power.<br/><br/>Edit: Oh yeah -- I host RandomWiki, which in turn hosts a whole lot of indie game stuff.  The core seed of that wiki is the Sorcerer section, which I put together to help me grok that game.  In turn, people have been using it toward that same purpose with a bunch of other games, as well as game theory -- all of which I think is awesome, even when (like Arref) it's Theory stuff that I'll never really 'get'.<br/><br/>I was married to a gamer for about 6 years.  We have an amazing daughter, about a year old, and her mom and I are still very good friends, and even game together -- fuck all those divorce stereotypes: it's all about the best thing for your kid.  I haven't gamed much at all in the last year, due to the little girl -- that's starting to change again, and I'm happy about that.<br/><br/>I date a gamer-girl who plays on the periphery of the nerdNYC crowd (and yeah, that's a long-ass commute for me), and through her I've met some of those folks in the last six months or so.  I'm acquiring a literary agent right now to work on mainstream publishing the books I write.<br/><br/>I'm 35.  I haven't met any of you face to face, and I'd kinda like that to change.<br/><br/>Hmm. That's about it.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            I'm James Crook, but I go by Jamey.  I am married (non-gamer), with no kids.  Instead, I've got two cats and a dog.  I grew up in upstate New York (Almond, NY.  Just try to find it, I dare you!), but moved to Columbus, Ohio about five years ago.<br/>
<br/>
I love games!  I love Indie RPGs, and have been working on developing my own, off-and-on, for quite a while.  Unfortunately, I haven't played enough, mostly just read them.<br/>

Yeah! But cool and refreshing, like a mint julep.<br/><br/>The Forge was the first forum that I've encountered that asked people to actually use their real names and whatnot. Now I see similar openness here. Is it a Forge-inspired thing?                        </div>

                            ... and another who didn't know about this thread.<br/><br/>I'm Travis Casey, 36 years old.  Online, I go by efindel everywhere I can (strangely, the name was already taken on AIM, so there I'm targaroth).  I live in Tallahassee, Florida with my new wife Sandy (just got married July 1!), two cats, a dog, a ferret, and two part-time children (my daughter by a previous marriage, who I have half the time, and her son by a previous, who we have summers and for holidays).<br/><br/>I started gaming with D&amp;D at 10 years old, and made my first system (a superhero mod of D&amp;D) within a year.  Since then, I've read and played pretty much every RPG I could get my hands on.  The ones I've played the most are AD&amp;D1 and 2, FASA's Star Trek, TORG, first edition Chill, Shadowrun, Elfquest, and my own homebrew universal RPG... but more about that in a minute.<br/><br/>After high school, I went to FSU here in Tallahasee, and got a BS in physics.  My undergrad years were when I designed and threw away three different universal RPGs before hitting on the one I used for years -- "Omniverse", a sort of hybrid of 1st edition CORPS and TORG.  Late in that period, I also got involved in the design of FUDGE enough to earn a credit in it.<br/><br/>I'd minored in Computer Science, and my grades there were actually better than in Physics, so I turned to CS for my Master's.  While there, I got involved with MUDs, eventually becoming an administrator on SWmud, a Star Wars-themed LPmud.  I started work on PsyberAge, a cyberpunk-with-psionics mud, using a variant of Omniverse, but it fell apart due to interpersonal issues before it got anywhere.<br/><br/>Around that time, I started doing PBEM RPGs, then got into an online D&amp;D campaign with old friends, run using WebRPG, then OpenRPG, then KloogeWerks.  I've played via IRC with the Indie-Netgaming crew, and was a playtester for Capes.<br/><br/>I wrote a column called Things That Go Bump in My Head for the short-lived gaming magazine Cryptych, and later wrote another column for Skotos -- <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/BSTG.shtml" rel="nofollow">Building Stories, Telling Games</a>.  Both were paying gigs that helped finance my RPG habit for a while.<br/><br/>Speaking of habits, I collect RPGs -- mainly ones that I consider to be of some historical significance to the hobby, or to have interesting systems.  I've got a couple hundred right now.<br/><br/>The games that I'd most like to play, but haven't, are Burning Wheel, Dogs in the Vineyard, Polaris, and The Shadow of Yesterday.  I got divorced and then married again in the last year, so I haven't gotten much actual play done in about a year and a half now.<br/><br/>My wife is a gamer as well -- these days mainly playing freeform online RPGs.  She's also active in the SCA.<br/><br/>My day job is as a Unix system administrator.  At home, I ran Linux for several years, but last year finally got tired of being my own sysadmin at home as well as work, and switched to OS X.  Which still has me doing sysadmin stuff, but not as often.  I don't have an intense dislike of Windows, but do hate Microsoft's current licensing schemes.  I keep checking on <a href="http://www.reactos.org" rel="nofollow">ReactOS</a> in hopes that they'll get to something useful... but don't currenly have an Intel-based PC at home to play with it on.<br/><br/>I have a <a href="http://efindel.livejournal.com" rel="nofollow">LiveJournal</a> that's rarely updated, and a <a href="http://home.earthlink.net" rel="nofollow">web site</a> that's even more badly in need of updating.<br/><br/>My "current" gaming project has been on the back burner for most of the last year, due to the aforementioned life events.  It's a vampire game called "... and cast no shadow", and I hope to get back to it soon.<br/><br/>I haven't met anyone here face-to-face.  I'll be at DragonCon this year, and would sincerely like to meet people.  I'm hoping to get to GenCon sometime soon -- maybe next year (cross fingers).                        </div>

                            My name is Joe McDonald.<br/>
I am 18 years old, currently live in Nakusp, BC, Canada.<br/>
<br/>
I hate the people I have grown up with in this town, and am leaving in 18 days forever.<br/>
Which might sound a bit harsh... but being a open-minded, atheistic, non-jock, bisexual in a redneck, church-heavy logging town is hell.<br/>
<br/>
Highlight of my life thus far was going to Sri Lanka, where I spent a month doing tsunami rebuilding and teaching ESL. I really want to work overseas at some point - possibly teaching ESL.<br/>
<br/>
I'm starting University next year at University of British Columbia.<br/>
I'm leaning towards majoring in Gender Studies and minoring in Linguistics, right now...<br/>
But I don't really have to make that decision yet.<br/>
<br/>
I am an atheist, and a nihilist.<br/>
I believe that the lack of inherent meaning in life or an afterlife is both liberating and inspiring - I have only to empower myself, earn some form of personal fulfillment, and become the person I want to be. There is no higher code or doctrine that I believe in. Yeah, liberating.<br/>
<br/>
My job is currently Content Developer for an online game project based out of Vancouver. It's basically my dream job right now  - high pay, work my own hours, a lot of focused creative energy... nice boss, cool project.<br/>
<br/>
Um... I love Chuck Palahniuk's books. Haunted destroyed me. Fight Club has been the single largest book influence in my life to date.                        </div>

                            I'm Mark Vallianatos. I post as markv here &amp; as redivider to rpg.net and the forge.<br/>
<br/>
I'm 35. I live in Pomona, california with my wife Johanna (a professor of children's theatre, creative drama, and puppetry at Cal State San Bernardino), our nearly 2 year old daughter Katya, and 4 cats. <br/>
<br/>
I work at the Urban and Environmental Policy Institute at Occidental College in L.A. where I'm currently the institute's managing director and director of its Center for Food and Justice. I'm co-author of The Next Los Angeles: the struggle for a livable city, a book about L.A.'s hidden progressive history and its political possibilities).  Before moving to Cali in 2000, I lived and worked in Washington D.C., specializing in international trade law and environmental issues. <br/>
<br/>
I grew up in Alexandria VA. I started role-playing in 1981 and played a lot of AD&amp;D, gama world, top secret, and boot hill, with a bit of exposure to a few non-tsr rpgs. I stopped playing rpgs between about 1988 and 2001. D&amp;D 3rd edition got me back into things and I've branched out from there.<br/>
<br/>
I've been working on a few game design projects for 3 years or so. I haven't published anything (although my late 90s report 'License to Loot' on the multilateral agreement on investment Sounds like it Could have been a game title.) I hope that Heads of State: nine short games about Tyrants, which our LA Games group recently play-tested, will see light later this year or early next.                        </div>

                            Me too.<br/>
<br/>
IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Frank. I live in the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg, GermanyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second largest and clearly most beautiful city, where I was born and raised, just like my father and grandfather before me. My last name is Tarcikowski, but nobody can pronounce that.<br/>
<br/>
IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m 29, divorced from my Persian ex-wife, but still a member of the Persian shiite community since I never bothered to quit. But actually, I consider myself agnostic.<br/>
<br/>
I have studied law and work as a lawyer for corporate and insolvency law. Next weekend, I will move into a nice new flat with my fantastic girlfriend Nicole. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a 21 year-old secretary and part time goth, which is probably why I am getting tattooed and pierced, and hang out at metal concerts and SM parties while my schoolmates buy houses and get babies. I could go on about how Nicole keeps me young and how our relationship is everything everybody kept telling me was impossible, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s boring without the nasty details.<br/>
<br/>
Nicole is also getting into gaming a little lately. She is one hell of a kick-ass gamist if IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever seen one.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m an RPG fanatic (why else would I be here). I would gladly become a fulltime RPG author if only thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d pay the bills. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m also a sucker for GunsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Roses and Manowar. And I love all kinds of fantasy novels. Never could get myself to read Ã¢â‚¬Å“realÃ¢â‚¬Â literature. Do love Shakespeare, though. <br/>
<br/>
Some other stuff I have some talent for, but didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really get around to much, include drawing, piano, composing, and writing. Well, I published a short story in an anthology for Ã¢â‚¬Å“Das Schwarze AugeÃ¢â‚¬Â once. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m hopelessly useless at sports, though, which sucks, but what can you do.                        </div>

                            Ah, good thread resurrection, I missed this one. Let's see if this tag will fix the formatting: <br/><br/>I'm Mike Reeves-McMillan. The Reeves is from my wife, who I met online before that was common. We were friends for a couple of years then figured ourselves out, and she left California (she's from Bakersfield) to live with me in my hometown of Auckland, New Zealand. We have the standard 2.2 cats (they give 110%).<br/><br/>I'm glad to discover I'm not the only Mike, the only New Zealander, the only Mike from NZ, or the oldest person here. I just turned 39.<br/><br/>I have a lot less RPG experience than most of you, having only played for a few years in my late 20s (AD&amp;D mostly, a bit of d6 system in a setting mashup of Star Wars, Star Trek and Doctor Who). I don't have a gaming group at the moment but reading about all these great indy games makes me want to assemble one in order to play them. My friends are all postmodern hippy creative people so my chances are probably better than average, though most of them have small children which means their time and energy is limited.<br/><br/>I get interested in far too many things for me to ever do any of them well. Hopefully that is changing; I've finished both a nonfiction book and a novel this year and the next step is probably to self-publish (since with traditional publishing of your first book you generally end up doing most of the promotion anyway). Most of my creative stuff is over at my website: <a href="http://www.csidemedia.com" rel="nofollow">C-Side Media.</a><br/><br/>I have an MA in English language, which got me into publishing, then technical writing. I learned enough to become a systems analyst, which is more or less what I still do. However, last year I did a Certificate in Celebrant Studies with the aim of making rituals for people in transition through crisis, and this year I'm doing an Advanced Diploma in Hypnotherapy which I hope will enable me to earn a living in a way that isn't IT, and more importantly make a significant difference to people's ability to live their lives positively.<br/><br/>I practice a slightly odd kind of Christianity and hope someday to get good at it. I like to say that I'm not a heretic, just orthodox in an unusual mode, but I don't think anyone is fooled.                        </div>

I particularly reccomend Primetime Adventures, InSpectres, Dogs in the Vineyard, Breaking the Ice, Polaris, and (if I may say so) 1001 Nights. I just ran a Buffy-verse PTA game with 5 kids ages 6 mos to 6 years running around in the background.                        </div>

It was the first drink that leapt to mind. Granted, as I was at work, so that it was alcoholic was no surpise.<br/><br/>A better choice might be the awesome asian pear cocktail from P.F.Chang's. It's half the reason I'm counting the days until GenCon.                        </div>

                            I can't believe I didn't mention books, given that it's the nearest thing I have to an addiction. I just spent $1200 on bookcases. Probably denial or something. Anyway: F&amp;SF, for a long time more the F than the SF but that seems to be changing more recently - I'm just getting so sick of "genre fantasy" recycling the same ideas. Permanent favourites are Terry Pratchett and Lois McMaster Bujold, others come and go. Also a wide range of odd nonfiction stuff in the realm of spirituality, esoterica, the mind and suchlike.<br/><br/>Like Kuma, I have a creeping sense that games are a genre whose time is about to come, hence my interest in being around where the foundations are being laid. So I can bore people when I'm old by telling them that I hung out on a forum with all the game designers that are now household names, yeah, I knew those guys back before they were even famous...<br/><br/>EDIT: You know, famous outside the 'hood. <i>World</i> famous.                        </div>

                            I haven't posted here yet? Huh.<br/>
<br/>
I'm 34 years old and live in a small town (approx 10,000 inhabitants) in Norway. It's great in summer and depressing in winter, and now it's summer, so I won't bitch.<br/>
<br/>
I'm married to a pretty girl who's also a psychologist, and we've got two children, Peder Benjamin (almost 5) and Oda Jeanette (1). They're amazing in very many ways, and I learn a lot from them; what fascinates me these days is how different children are even from birth, and how much effect small initial differences can have on personality. One is more sensitive than the other, which causes radically different behavior. I used to think you could teach kids anything, that they were blank slates, and that later they could just change their personality as they liked, but these days I feel pretty deterministic.<br/>
<br/>
I've written the Norwegian RPG <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.draug.no" rel="nofollow">Draug</a>, and recently received an arts grant to work on the holocaust RPG "We all had names". With the recent developments in Israel, I have a lot to think about.<br/>
<br/>
I've internalized a lot of Big Model stuff and Forge-speak in the last two years; however, I'm also part of the Nordic tradition, which softens things up and lets me be more slow about everything. I wish I were a Kenotic Immersive, since that's such a cool term, but I'm just this guy, you know? Perhaps I'll write an article about immersionism sometime.<br/>
<br/>
Besides playing a lot and reading &amp; talking &amp; thinking WAY too much about RPG's, I work as a programmer, design stuff for my board game "Kampen om Rai", and write fiction, and never cease to be amazed at the difference between what's important in the world and what people get paid to do.                        </div>

                            Aaaah, the sweet smell of necromancy in the morning!<br/><br/>I am Alexander Newman. I live with my beloved partner of nearly 3 years, Andrew, in Astoria, NY. He's a composer and pianist.<br/><br/>I was born in England, and mostly raised in London, although I was exiled to boarding schools between the ages of 8 and 18, and spent summers in Greece - so I speak a little Greek with what I've been told is a peasant accent.<br/><br/>I travelled around the world before going to college, stopping to teach English in Bangkok, where I also lived as a status symbol for a police colonel, along with the family astrologer. I first came out to a stranger in the hill village of Mae Hong Son in Northern Thailand, over a bottle of some awesome prune liquor. Later, on the same journey, I came out my best friend, Ben, in a sit-down fish and chip shop in Sydney, Australia. I am now godparent to his second daugher (of four or five kids). Coming out to Ben was so painful, I resolved never to leave new friends or colleagues in a position where it wasn't clear to them where my interests lay - a policy that has served me well.<br/><br/>I have an MA in Mathematics from Oxford, although I only sat the BA degree - it's a quirk of history - and resided at Keble College. I got the lowest Third in my year, because I precisely deduced the minimum achievement that required the award of an honours degree. As a result I left a majority of my finals papers after 30 minutes, to the envy (I assume) of many of my colleagues. It hasn't seemed to hurt me any.<br/><br/>I was an activist for many years at Oxford, and with OutRage! London, but never succeeded in getting arrested, although my friend Philip and I sparked a riot outside the Houses of Parliament, once.<br/><br/>I have a BA in Acting from the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, in London, where I coincided with Orlando Bloom - who I didn't know that well, but saw regularly in tights. My acting career has yet to take off.<br/><br/>I left the UK six years ago, partly because I wanted to live in New York City, but mostly because I couldn't deal with being around my crazy family any more. The Atlantic is a great healer, as are timezone differences.<br/><br/>I am currently unemployed: I was laid off from a programming job for a big Wall St. firm in January, but the stars seem to be aligning for a super-cool new technical writing job in New York.<br/><br/>My first RPG was D&amp;D in 1982 or 3, and I played sporadic games of D&amp;D, a whacky scifi homebrew and Call of Cthulhu for about four or five years after that, then went on a 20-year hiatus. I am glad the hiatus ended with the discovery of nerdNYC and the GGG. I also play many boardgames, word games, mind game, and status games. I currently have a love affair with <em>Plunder!</em> </div>

                            Hey! Nice to see folks I recognize from other forums :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I'm Britton Daniel, and I'm 39. I'm currently in my second career as a museum archaeologist and conservator -- I'll be doing my graduate work starting in the fall at St. Chad's College, University of Durham. Previously, I worked in the film industry for far too long as a best boy electric, gaffer, and lighting technician. Did a lot of theatre and opera, as well.<br/>
<br/>
Started gaming in '74, with Napoleonic miniatures. My first game of D&amp;D was in '76, but I didn't really understand it 'till '77. And then Runequest came out, and changed everything.                        </div>

<p>Well, if Buzz hadn't revived this thread recently, I would have done so. And I was pleased to see mentioned in some other thread around here that the management (i.e. Andy) are fine with so-called "thread necromancy," as I've never really understood the opposition to continuing perfectly good threads.</p>
<p>Anyhow: I'm Philip LaRose. I'm 36, a New Hampshire native, child of Franco-Americans who are children of French-Canadians stretching back to the late seventeenth century. I lived in my hometown until 2000, then lived with a couple guys and the world's largest collection of media in a rented house in Medford, Massachusetts (just outside Boston) for about 18 months, before a college friend called me up and told me to move to Seattle and work for his company, which I did. I've been in Seattle since March 2002 and will be quite content to stay the rest of my life. Oh yeah, trivia moment: I now live about 500 feet from John Harper's first apartment in Seattle.</p>
<p>I first learned about Dungeons &amp; Dragons back in fifth grade and borrowed my friend's "red box" set for a while, but didn't actually start playing until another friend ran an adventure for me in seventh grade. I made up and ran my first adventure, the "Temple of the Moon Dagger," in eighth grade, and it was awful, though we still had some fun. I think I've gotten a little better at inventing and running scenarios since then, but I'm much more anxious about it now. I discovered <i>Talislanta</i> in 1988, and that became the main game I ran for years, though as the years passed and some friends moved away, gaming became more and more infrequent.</p>
<p>In 1995 I bought my first Mac and got on the Internet, and shortly joined the Talislanta mailing list, where I "met" John Harper.  So I've known him for 11 years now, though I only met him in person for the first time a couple months after moving to Seattle. We've been good friends since then. I also introduced him to another of my college friends, Tony (Dowler, who's not on these forums (yet)), and we've done a lot of game discussion and playing together. In the latter part of 2002, after lamenting that we had far more cool ideas for games than time to make or play them, we started the blog <a href="http://attacksofopportunity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">Attacks of Opportunity</a> to post them so maybe others could take advantage of them. I experienced John's conversion to the indie game theory and design group firsthand, as he set about explaining these new ideas to me and converting me (and Tony, and anyone else who'll listen), and that's pretty much why I'm here on these forums today.</p>
<p>I work as a technical editor/writer and office manager for a small software services/development company, which in turn mostly works for Microsoft. I took violin lessons from third grade through high school, and then played with an amateur orchestra until I was 30; I've barely played since then. I do love rock music of various genres and have made it a point to catch at least one show a month since 2005. I majored in procrastination in college, although my diploma says "Literature". I am single and childless, and have no real expectation of that ever changing. However, I have a lovely white cat named Nimiel to keep me company. I am not actually working on any game designs of my own, but really should pick one of my ideas and start fleshing it out. I expect to lurk for a while as I catch up on threads. Also, apparently I'm quite verbose and should finish here.</p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">Edit: Tony just noticed that I wrote that my <i>diplomacy </i>says "Literature", rather than my <i>diploma</i>. How embarrassing!</span></p> </div>

                            My name is Stuart Robertson.  I'm 32 and live in Ontario, Canada.   I work as a professional web designer, and teach a 3rd year University course in Toronto. I have a 20-month old son, and my wife and I are expecting our second child this fall.  <br/>
<br/>
When I was about 9 years old, I was introduced to an unusual game called "Dungeons &amp; Dragons". I bought the red "Basic" book (pre-punched for a 3-ring binder!), and the module "Horror on the Hill".  Since it was my game, I ended up being the Dungeon Master -- and I've been interested in games, and how they work ever since.<br/>
<br/>
I played a lot of different Role-playing games throughout High-school, read a lot of Fighting Fantasy books, and played tabletop war games - mostly Battletech, Warhammer and Warhammer 40K.<br/>
<br/>
Since going to University, I've mostly played board-games and have a definite preference for "German style" games -- although Balderdash remains a family favourite.<br/>
<br/>
I've been lurking on this site for some time, as well as other places like The Forge, and many of the RPG theory blogs.  I'm currently working on a board-game that incorporates many of the elements from old school Fantasy games like early D&amp;D, Talisman, and Fighting Fantasy -- while having more "modern" boardgame mechanics.                        </div>

                            Hi there!<br/>
<br/>
My name's Peter Dyring-Olsen, I'm 33 years old and currently living in Copenhagen, which I like a lot for so many different reasons. My girlfriend's called Ditte and we have a daughter who's 1.5 years old, is called Freja and is just amazing in so many ways. Oh, and we're expecting number two come February.<br/>
<br/>
I have a Master's Degree in English and Art History. <br/>
<br/>
I work as a children's books editor at the most commercial publisher you can imagine. So, I do my very best to raise the quality. It's a daily struggle not to lose heart.<br/>
<br/>
I've been playing drums for the last - oh - 13 years on and off - been working pretty seriously on music in a number of different bands but currently I'm taking a break, rethinking that part of my life.<br/>
<br/>
I'm the type that reads and talks too much about RPGs - and consequently plays way to little. I've been trying to set up a couple of regular groups for a long time. Hopefully, this effort will meet with some success soon.<br/>
<br/>
I hope to play Burning Wheel, TSoY, DitV, AG&amp;G and others very soon!<br/>
<br/>
I like throwing dice (I'm not kidding you - I just do for some reason!). I think I'm a better GM than player. I suck at immersive play. My skills as a strategist are almost nonexistant. I get ideas for game design and then I drop them again. <br/>
<br/>
My favourite book might just be Crime and Punishment - other than that, I guess it has to be BrÃ¸drene LÃ¸vehjerte by Swedish genius Astrid Lindgreen.<br/>
<br/>
The best album in the world is either Abbey Road or Sgt. Pepper by The Beatles. A close second would then be A Love Supreme by John Coltrane.<br/>
<br/>
I ride my bike to work almost every day.                        </div>

I'm Andrew Cooper.  I'm a 35 year old Software Developer from East Tennessee.  I obviously like to play games or I most likely wouldn't be here.  I was introduced to role-playing as a plebe at West Point.  While this makes me a relatively late-comer to the role-playing scene (I was 18 before ever playing) I'm old enough to have a few years in the hobby under my belt anyway.  Other than gaming, I read a good bit of fantasy and sci fi fiction.  My current favorite being George RR Martin.  I also play trumpet and am the worship leader at our church.<br/>
<br/>
I'm married to a wonderful and gorgeous Filipina woman named Hazel.  She is currently finishing up her degree in Business.  She is a dancer and runs a dance and Pilates studio.  She also heads up the dance ministry at our church.  We have 1 child, Gabriel, who is 2 years old.  He is proof positive that a perpetual motion machine is completely possible.  Hazel and I want to have 1 or 2 more children and then we'll probably adopt a couple also.  Kids are the bomb.<br/>
<br/>
Um...  I think that about wraps it up.                        </div>

                            I'm Ewen Cluney. "Ewen" is pronounced like "Aaron," though my parents have yet to give me a satisfactory explanation as to why. I'm 27 (until next month), and live in San Jose, CA. My background is a bunch of European ethnicities mashed together, and supposedly a tiny bit of Native American somewhere. I just graduated from San Jose State University with a BA in Japanese, and I'll be starting on an MA in the same at San Francisco State University in the fall. Through having friends in the right places and dumb luck, I've been able to become a freelance translator, mostly working on video games, but hopefully expanding to some other things in the near future. At some point I definitely need to try living in Japan. I used to think that becoming a programmer would be a good idea for me, which is why it took so long for me to get my BA in Japanese.<br/><br/>I was raised Unitarian Universalist, but on Sundays I'm usually too lazy to go to church, so I'm mostly just a generic agnostic, though I've been leaning more towards atheism lately. I'm single, and that doesn't bother me as much as it probably should.<br/><br/>I'm big into <a href="http://nekoewen.deviantart.com/" rel="nofollow">writing</a>, though as with RPGs it take forever for me to finish revising anything to my satisfaction. I literally have about three novels in various states of incompleteness. Somewhere along the line I started writing the occasional poem, though I like writing in blank verse for some reason. I play video games, but not nearly as much as I used to, and most of the really popular genres (especially MMOs) totally leave me cold. I like to read, mostly really whacked-out speculative fiction or Japanese light novels, and some manga. I like certain comics, and too much anime. I have a <a href="http://www.neko-machi.com/cgi-bin/comicrant.pl?date=2005-01-21" rel="nofollow">crappy webcomic</a> that I do mostly as a vehicle for in-jokes to amuse my friends, but creatively I consider myself a writer who doodles a bit, and not an artist.<br/><br/>I got into RPGs in middle school with Robotech, and played mostly Palladium stuff through high school, then got away from that when I realized that absolutely every new system I ever tried made more sense to me in one way or another. My group can never seem to settle on any one system for more than a single campaign, though Mekton Z has recurred a lot. We're currently playing Truth &amp; Justice.                        </div>

                            Hey guys - I'm new here so go gentle on me!<br/><br/>I'm Andrew Kenrick, I'm 25 years old and live in Sherwood Forest in England (yes, really!). I'm a freelance games designer, writer and editor, as well as owner and publisher at <a href="http://www.steampowerpublishing.co.uk" rel="nofollow">Steampower Publishing</a>. We produce games now and again, our most recent indie game being Dead of Night.<br/><br/>When not writing or publishing (which admittedly takes up most of my life), I run the IT helpdesk at a local college. Believe it or not, I'm an archaeologist by training, but haven't dug anything up (living or dead) for a good few years now. I live with my girlfriend, Ruth, who is most assuredly not into gaming, although can handle Munchkin. She's wonderfully tolerant, and is even the co-director of SP.<br/><br/>I have a blog too - <a href="http://littlestkobold.livejournal.com" rel="nofollow">littlestkobold.livejournal.com</a><br/><br/>Nice to meet you all!                        </div>

                            Hello all:<br/>
I'm Robert Earley-Clark. I'm living currently in (not-so) sunny San Francisco. I'm a western New Yorker by birth ( The beautiful Finger Lakes, northernmost outpost of Appalachia), although my heart belongs to New Orleans where I lived for ten years before heading West. By the western zofdiac, I'm an Aries, so red things are supoosed to be good for me. This explains my politics. By the eastern zodiac, I'm a pig: This explains my incessant need to eat bacon.<br/>
<br/>
There is a former-Mrs.Komradebob in my past, although it has been years since I was married. I also have a lovely 9 yo daughter (Threnody), who lives with said former-Mrs.Komradebob in Northern CA, hence my current location. I'm single, and have mixed feelings both about that state and alternately ending that state.<br/>
<br/>
I've been gaming for an embarassingly long time, playing just about every one of the old TSR games form the 1980s at one point or another, most of the WW stuff in the early 90s, and all kinds of other stuff along the way. My current interst is in creating horrific Frankenstein's Monster like hybrids of minis games and these crazy indie-designs these kids are making today.<br/>
<br/>
Confession: I choose music based entirely upon how I feel about the way fans of the particular genre dress. Nope, I swear, it's true. Thus, Rockabilly, Punk, Swing, Goth-Industrial, Worldmusic ,and Jazz are all Good Things. Disco is Bad. Funk is marginal, as is Trad and BlueGrass, though I secretly like those too.<br/>
<br/>
I started college working on a double major in History and Archaeology, but got thrown out during Gulf War I for protests I was involved in and never went back to the halls of higher learning. This stressed me for a long time, but I'm kind of liking my prole job these days.<br/>
<br/>
That cover all the important bases?<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
Robert                        </div>

                            I'm Tyler Bachelder (pronounced bockelder) I live in Scottsburg, IN... southern end for those who are interested. I'm about 45 minutes from Louisville, which according to this thread, would put me in the neighborhood of a couple of users here. I'm one of the forum's vibrant youth at twenty years old. I'm currently transitioning from high school into college... transitioning in that I still have no idea what I want to do and am trying to figure that all out. I guess that comes with youth. <br/>
<br/>
I am partially blind, and the disorder is congenital. At least being born with it makes it impossible to -not- cope. It really isn't all that bad, excluding the fact that my hobbies of choice are hobbies in which having better vision would be to my benefit. I'm thinking specifically of RPGs, of course, and the reading of their rulebooks. <br/>
<br/>
I started out on D&amp;D 3e. Having been raised in a highly religious setting, I didn't get to try out the games I always wanted to play until I got a bit older and more rebellious. My experience with actual game systems is pretty narrow because I play with narrow-minded players. I'd like to change that. I'm currently plugging for PTA in our group, and should be GMing a season shortly if things go as planned. I got hooked on the whole indie scene thanks to FATE *tipping the hat to Fred and Rob, who've provided excellent support for the game in the mailing list* and from FATE, I found The Forge. It all branched out from there.<br/>
<br/>
I'm particularly attracted to indie games due to their accessability. Plain and simple, I cannot read mainstream published books unless I put in the time to scan, OCR, and edit them. There are far too many mainstream games I'd like to play for all that. So, I play mainstream games through friends that give me the rules as we go. But in the indie scene, we have pdf files. With the use of some nice software, I can have them read to me, which is to my benefit. I'm also skewed heavily towards a more narrative form of play, so it was a pretty organic transition for me. I'm particularly interested in playing FATE, PTA, DitV, Don't Rest Your Head (just bought), Polaris, TSoY, The Mountain Witch, and My Life With Master. <br/>
<br/>
Random facts:<br/>
<br/>
I read, a lot. I write a lot less, but want to do so more readily. I know a little bit about a lot of things. I guess that comes from having too much time and broadband, eh? I'm a huge music geek, and enjoy a load of styles from jazz to metal to rag time to just about anything else. I used to play video games a lot, but thanks to a recent surgery, I'm much less inclined to do so. I lost a fair amount of vision in my left eye, putting me out of the end of my senior year in high school. That set me back roughly a year's worth of time. It also killed my video game hobbie pretty definitely with the exception of the occasional game or two now and again.<br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping that I can provide some insight to these discussions with my unique view (no pun intended) on the gaming hobbie.<br/>
<br/>
I also think I've rambled on for long enough at this point. Any minute facet of my personality you folks want to target will inevitably come out eventually. I'm a pretty up-front sort.<br/>
<br/>
Here's to some kickass discussion!                        </div>

                            Wow. I really should update this. So here goes:<br/><br/>Howdy.  I'm Thomas, a mid-30s cartoonist.  I'm currently attending the University of Arizona in my spare time, going for a BFA.  Recently, I've decided to make the plunge into gaming web fora at RPGNet, the Forge, and here -- at all three places, I post under Thomas D.  Like JDCorley, I'm in Tucson, Arizona, and am married to a brain researcher.  Husbands of Tucson-based brain researchers represent, yo, indeed.<br/><br/>I started playing D&amp;D with the basic box set, the one with the all-blue cover.  My dad gave it to me because his wife at the time and he "didn't understand how to play it".  Several years later, after he became Born Again and started watching The 700 Club, became concerned about me playing those evil role-playing games. <br/><br/>I still have the dice from that set.<br/><br/>As I've said, I'm a cartoonist.  I have some of my comic works at <a href="http://thesnakefarm.com" rel="nofollow">TheSnakeFarm.com</a>, I've been published in a few small press papers, and have developed a few comic book titles for a company that does educational material for the K-6 set.<br/><br/>I've been to high school in West Germany, when it was West Germany, down to college in Texas after which a friend said they needed an illustrator for a company working on this new thing called "the Internet" that might turn out to be popular.  A few years later and I'm in Manhattan, coasting along the dot-com bubble, when some asshole flies a plane into the building next door, and we wind up in Arizona.<br/><br/>I've participated in the 24 Hour RPG project twice now, once with a television action show game called <i>Scene Stealers</i> and with the Owlbear Challenge (<i>Winnie-the-Owl-Pooh: Adventures in d100 Acre Wood</i> and <i>The Cave at Owl-Pooh Corner</i>).                        </div>

                            Hey, folks. This seems like as good a place as any for my first post to this board.<br/><br/>I'm Paul Watson (I got tired of coming up with board handles a while back), 39 (almost) and married to a wonderful <a href="http://duskborn.livejournal.com/" rel="nofollow">woman</a> for the last ten years. She's not into RPG/Story Games, but she supports my hobby and puts up with my infrequent pestering to start gaming <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> , and enjoys my collection of board and card games. We have one child, a daughter, ten years old, and very much into gaming. We live in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, and I've been living here for about 20 years now.<br/><br/>Politically I don't identify as conservative/liberal/right/left/etc. My staunchly liberal friends are convinced that I'm conservative and couldn't possibly have a liberal thought in my head. My staunchly conservative friends believe the opposite. Meh. I'm a middle-path kind of person.<br/><br/>Spiritually/religiously, I'm mainly a <a href="http://www.thetroth.org/" rel="nofollow">Heathen</a> with some Thelema and Taoism thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>Professionally, I work for IBM Global Services doing internal tools development, mainly in Java (some desktop, some enterprise), with a little PHP and a dash of Python. I've been there for about 8 years now. Before that, I did some work for the federal government, and a little teaching (taught programming to teens).<br/><br/>I've been playing RPGs since 1981 or thereabouts, staring with that boxed D&amp;D set moving on to AD&amp;D, RuneQuest, GURPS, Werewolf, and something like 30 or 40 other games. A few years ago, I lost almost all interest in RPGs after a fairly disastrous, short-lived campaign. The problem wasn't the system, it was me. I had just lost interest.<br/><br/>Aside from roleplaying/story games, I'm into boardgames (like Settlers and Carcassonne), card games (like Killer Bunnies and Munchkin), computer games (I've put an embarassing number of hours into WoW), writing software for pleasure, miniature gaming (Confrontation), great novels, poetry, history, TV, movies, music, snakes, lizards and rabbits.<br/>In one last attempt as salvaging my interest in the hobby, I did a quick search for FUDGE variants, finding FATE. FATE introduced me to roleplaying concepts that were completely alien to me. Browsing the FATE mailing list, I found a reference to a site called The Forge ... and now I own quite a number of indie/small press/narrativist/hippie-commie/whatever games <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> . I'm a bit of a compulsive collector.                        </div>

                            I'm Malcolm Craig. Hi!<br/><br/>Aged 31, originally from Falkirk, a boring town in Central Scotland. Now living in beautiful Edinburgh.<br/><br/>As a day job, I do online marketing and advertising for a financial corporation in Edinburgh. By night, I occassionally design games. Other than this, I love mountain biking, snowboarding, movies and lots of other stuff.<br/><br/>Hang on, this is beginning to sound like a dating agency!<br/><br/>Well, the first game I ever played was CoC, age 14. It lasted 30 minutes and ended up in total chaos. This, I thought, was roleplaying. Then a few minutes later I played 1st ed Twilight 2000. Maybe this explains a lot? Maybe it doesn't. And the first game I ever ran was an awful Traveller scenario I'd written myself. A truly desperate attempt. But I think things have got better since then.<br/><br/>My gaming epiphany moment? Playing in a demo of Dust devils run by Matt Snyder at Gen Con 2005. Great times.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malc                        </div>

                            I'm Matthew Gandy, 32, currently residing in Raleigh, NC. I'm working on my first design(s), mostly at the inspiration of Fred Hicks and Rob Donoghue. Fred and I gamed in high school and reconnected after I finished my Master's. I have a non-descript day job, a game-tolerating (and occasionally -playing) wife, and three cats. Of my various other hobbies, I'm a bit of a gadget geek, anime junkie, and preschool-level Japanese student.<br/><br/>I live in the same area as the Durham3, whom I hope to meet in far distant Indianapolis next week. Go figure! Guys, I'll buy you lunch back in Raleigh sometime soon.<br/><br/>Clinton, I think I work a few blocks away from you.<br/><br/>Malcolm, my brother-in-law and his family currently live in or near Edinburgh. It's a small world.<br/><br/>My first gaming experience was definitely one of the early D&amp;Ds (probably Basic), but I don't know exactly with whom. My parents forced me to "retire" from gaming for a few years. When I convinced them to let me play again, I played some Palladium games (BTS, TMNT, Robotech) and CoC (during which I unleashed the *brilliant* plan to summon a monster *as a diversion* and later pressed the button that unleashed the shoggoth), but it was Fred introducing me to Champions and getting me to read superhero comics that really turned on the lights. It's been a looong time since then, and I drifted from the mainstream a few years ago. My last regular game was a FATE supernatural western for Fred, Rob, and their posse, in which they all played hanged criminals brought back from the dead to work for the Devil. Since that ran down about a year ago, I'm out of practice GMing (and way outta practice playing). I just started running The Mountain Witch for two local groups. I hope to play about a dozen indie games at GenCon next week. After that is almost certainly Dogs in the Vineyard and some playtests of my own projects. <br/><br/>And Fred Hicks is most certainly not sane. Less stressed, yes, but not sane. We prefer him that way. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Hi everyone, I'm Michael Underwood (The MR in my username isn't for Mr., instead it's my first two initials, (M)ichael (R)obert.  So you know.<br/>
<br/>
I'm 23, born in Bloomington, Indiana with early stints living in Texas, Brooklyn, New Jersey, back to Bloomington through undergrad at IU (East Asian Studies and an individualized major in Creative Mythology--ie. fiction writing+mythology).  I'm about to go back to Eugene, OR to start my second year of a Master's degree in Folklore.<br/>
<br/>
I'm an aspiring speculative fiction writer, and this year, have started and become somewhat obsessed with Argentine Tango.<br/>
<br/>
I started gaming when I was 8 or 9, when classmates in Brooklyn grabbed me to make a character for this neat thing called D&amp;D.  We were playing Al-Qadim, and I made a Barbarian.  With a dune buggy.  I like to think this was somewhat indicative of my approach to life.  I've been gaming pretty continuously since then, as well as getting involved with a Changeling LARP in Bloomington for several years.  I also worked at a FLGS for four and a half years before moving out west.<br/>
<br/>
I live in a graduate-student co-op, which is an amazing experience and more functional than I suspected it would be.  It's a great environment, and our dinner conversations are some of the most mind-blowing (or odd) things in the world.<br/>
<br/>
I'm writing my thesis on RPGs, with the focus on the way that people bring different creative expectations/backgrounds to gaming (IE a group of fiction writers playing a tabletop game to simulate making a novel vs. drama students playing a game for character immersion, etc.) and how that creates interesting variances in the way RPGs are played and designed.<br/>
<br/>
I've had many gaming epiphanies, but my biggest moment was playing in a Cinematrix game (modification of Engle Matrix Games) in the designer's personal fantasy world and maintaining a really strong IC state while also working to collaborate with the other players on the OOC level to make a campaign-defining scene.<br/>
<br/>
I may have begun designing my first RPG for publication with the niggling idea that's developing over here:<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1195&amp;page=1#Item_2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1195&amp;page=1#Item_2</a> </div>

                            My name is Jake Richmond. I'm 28. I've never met anyone I liked well enough to marry. I live in Portland Oregon in a house I share with some friends. Its the most relaxed and comfortable place I've ever lived. I've tried going back to school three times in the last 5 years,but each time I get bored and end up dropping out. I make my money illustrating games and comics, and doing a bit of freelance writing. Which ex-plains why I'm almost always broke. <br><br>My work takes up most of my time, but when I can I like to read sci-fi novels, watch import movies and eat Hawaiian food.

                            My name is Steven Jarvis. I'm 37 and live in Fayetteville, Arkansas (the upper left corner) where I'm a web designer/developer for a newspaper group, though I also do a lot of freelance work (<a href="http://www.kudzudesign.com/" rel="nofollow">Kudzu Design</a>). I have a poorly-updated blog at <a href="http://www.sjarvis.com/" rel="nofollow">sjarvis.com</a>. I like to characterize myself as an overeducated underachiever. I have a B.A. in English/Creative Writing, an M.A. in American Lit, an M.A. in Southern Studies (think American Studies, only concentrating on the American South), and a J.D. (law degree). I've worked as an English teacher, a radio DJ, an editor, a lawyer (no more, thank God!), a reporter, a graphic designer, and now the web designerating. I have an awesome wife, Hallie, who teaches German to high school kids, and an awesome son, Daniel, who is 3.5 and a real lover of polyhedral dice ("Let's play dice, Daddy!") and a practiced slayer of ogres and trolls.<br><br>In what little free time I squeeze out of the day I make electronic music (in the ambient-ish IDM and synthpop sub-sub-sub-genres under the moniker <a href="http://www.iteratemusic.com/" rel="nofollow">Iterate</a>), and I also play drums, guitar, bass, and keyboards (primitively) but these days play mostly laptop (a Mac, of course). I've been playing RPGs since the summer of 1981 where I learned to play D&amp;D at band camp, and I've played off and on since then, mostly on through college then off through grad/law school, but pretty consistently for the last 2 or 3 years. These days it's mostly hippie indie games, including a lot of Burning Wheel. I've been a Forge lurker for a couple of years and semi-active on some other RPG-related boards as Kudzu or sjarvis. I'm currently working intently on my first real game design (the first actual was when I was about 13) after getting inspired at GenCon 2006.                        </br></br></div>

                            People call me Victor Gijsbers, which also happens to be my name. I live in the Netherlands, in the city of Utrecht; while I work some 60 kilometers eastward in Leiden. My job is at the Philosophy Department of Leiden University, where I am writing a PhD-thesis on the philosophy of explanation, and am teaching students the basics of philosophy of science and epistemology. I'll also be giving a course on Richard Rorty soon. My previous education was in physics and philosophy. I am currently 23 years old, but this number tends to change with some regularity.<br><br>As to roleplaying games: I started playing them some seven years ago, but it was a mixed experience until I tried out <i>My Life with Master</i> and became sold on indie games. From that time on, I have been interested in these fun little games, with some of my favourites being <i>Polaris</i>, <i>Bacchanal</i> and <i>Breaking the Ice</i>. I used to hang around on the theory fora of the Forge; nowadays I have my own theory and design blog. I am also playtesting a game called <i>Shades</i>, which I want to turn into an actual book. (I love books. I love to read them, sure, but I also love the very material presence of books. My room is full of them; philosophy, fantasy and high literature, mostly.)                        </br></br></div>

                            Howdy, all.<br>
<br>
I'm D.J. Chagnon, 31 (and counting), and living in Somerville, MA (just outside Boston) - which means I really ought to try to connect with the local SG crowd, since it sounds like this area is a hotbed of it.  I think I know some of the same people as a lot of folks but haven't met them.  Same goes for the Ithaca crowd, since I did my Master's at Cornell and was pretty active in the Games club there.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, back to Somerville/Boston, where I'm happily married as of just over a year ago, working as a Landscape Architect, and getting my weekly RPG fix on through two alternating campaigns with one slightly-dysfunctional but good group (one high-fantasy epic D20, one Serenity).  Currently, I'm not running anything - when I get a chance to do so, I'm looking to branch us out into something more indie, shake things up a little and help us find some new tools to bring into the more mainstream stuff that bunch prefers.  I'm also a fairly frequent player of the Vampire CCG - the only one that really keeps my attention anymore - and my otherwise-non-gaming wife and I play boardgames when we can with whoever we can.<br/>
<br/>
I haven't yet brought any RPG designs past the rough-preliminary-notes stage, but for a while I was involved in a few CCG lines.  If I weren't a landscape architect, I think I'd be a graphic designer - I really love tinkering with it even though I've got no formal training in that particular branch of design.<br/>
<br/>
Life's pretty darn peachy, all in all.<br/>
<br/>

                            My name is Jasper Polane, and I'm 32 years old. 33 next month... How time flies. I'm married, and our little boy is 9 months old. I live in the Netherlands, in Leiden. I work as script writer, animation designer and director from my animation studio here. My most succesful project is a cartoon show for pre-school kids about two giraffes called Dip &amp; Dap.<br/>
<br/>
I'm gaming at least once a week, sometimes role-playing, sometimes boardgames. Currently I'm playing The Shadow of Yesterday and The Princes' Kingdom. I wrote a 24-hour game for the Ronnies called Cosmic Combat, and I'm trying to develop it, but suck at it. I'm also writing a game called Reservoir Ducks, about ducks with guns.                        </div>

Lesse, I am 31 years old, I have been in a monogamous relationship for the last 9 years. I live in Phoenix Arizona although we hope to move to seattle within the next year or 2. I have worked various technical support/computer geek jobs for over a decade now and currently work in the Credit Card Industry helping programmers make POS software. I have vague intentions to eventually go to school full time and am currently thinking I want to be a librarian. <br/>
<br/>
As far as gaming, I have been interested in gaming since I was 12, although I didnt actually find a real group till I was 16. I am currently in a group with Lxndr and Eric J. Boyd although we have only gotten to a single playtest session of Eric's cool little game. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I try to design but I seriously lack any sort of follow thru or organizational skills if theres noone pushing me, so my GD blog is woefully un-updated at <br/>

I ran mostly homebrew games in my early years due to lack of knowledge about the industry or community. I work as a cell phone tech for one of the big companies but originally was an English Major from UCF. I've lived in Japan and know enough Japanese and Spanish to get me in trouble. <br/>

I'm engaged to get married this coming March and communte off and on again to Orlando to be with friends. I call myself an Alphageek due to my endless array of hobbies including: Video Gaming, Comics, Cosplay, Anime, LARPing, etc, etc, etc.  On my free time I write reviews for video game companies for free product. Currently I'm playing Exalted but can run GURPS, HERO, Mekton Zeta, nWOD and others at the drop of a hat.                        </div>

                            Hey, my name is Jeff Bent. I'm a Canadian fella living in Austin, TX. In my free time, I'm a <a href="http://www.sporecloud.com" rel="nofollow">webcomics type guy</a>, doing random shit at random intervals. Seems I'll be doing some illustrations in the Names book, thanks to the subtle machinations of local boy Remi Treuer. He's also the reason I found this place. I was surprised and delighted to find an indie gaming scene existed. I had no idea. I checked the Forge out once, but it seemed pretty dry.<br/><br/>I've gamed off and on throughout my 30 years. Back in the day (1997-2001ish I guess) I did a whole lot of WoD MUSHing. While I think MUSHing is a fantastic venue for RP in theory, in practice the crazy people there pretty much left me burnt out. These days I play tabletop DnD with wife and friends, but wish for better, more clever games.                        </div>

                            Mark Nau, life presently divided into 4 roughly equal time slices.<br/>
1) Family guy. Father to two daughters, 6 and 3. We play pretend and make up games together. My wife and I have been together so long we practically function as a unit. Meaning she's in charge.<br/>
2) Creative Director for the Spider-Man 3 console games. 10 years ago, I joined a small company early and over time we grew and then got assimilated.<br/>
3) Sleep. Wife has trained me to do so face down to abate snoring.<br/>
4) Me-time. Subdivisions:<br/>
a) Finding some interesting challenge and seeing how good I can get. Currently working on my mad poker skillz.<br/>
b) Checking out interesting indie/niche-market games of all media. Currently digging "Dwarf Fortress" and "Toribash" on the computer. I generally don't play mass-market games. Yes, there is some tension between that and item #2.<br/>
c) Reading. Currently evolutionary psych and economics.<br/>
d) Screwing around on the internet while the TV is on, occasionally chatting with the Wife. That's where you guys come in.                        </div>

                            Good day. I'm Zach Welhouse.<br/><br/>At 22, I'm hardly the youngest here but decidedly part of the Still an Undergraduate club. I'm presently enjoying my last few days of this Wisconsin summer before heading back to Mount Vernon, Iowa to earn my degrees in English and History.<br/><br/>My gaming history began in 3rd grade with a copy of DragonQuest and has taken the predictable path from overpowered TSR fun to surly indie navel-gazing, with the occasional side-trek into samurai and cowboys. As the historian for the Cornell College Chess and Games club, I tend to spend more time organizing and running games than being a player. If this doesn't change soon, there will be a reckoning.<br/><br/>I've participated in a few game design challenges over the past two years, and recently <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/369202" rel="nofollow">published a thing</a>. <br/><br/>My non-roleplaying hobbies include playing the marimba, yoga, and partaking in modern Japanese visual culture. My next life goal is to obtain an Osu! Tatakae Ouendan costume and the moves to pull it off. The senior thesis on translating the Arabian Nights follows pretty closely behind, however.                        </div>

                            Better late than never, right?<br/><br/>I'm Sara McAtee from Twin Cities, Minnesota.  <br/>Just another Blond in hiding, I masquerade as a fiery red head with brown eyes, olive skin and some freckles.   <br/>I never went to college, although my goal was originally a double PHD in pyschology, (with a minor in Child Autism), and Philosophy, (Minor in documentation), and a third minor in Theology.   (Needless to say, Money matters; I didn't have enough of it and opted to not go at all, if I couldn't go for what I wanted - I'm a rather stubborn girl)<br/><br/>I'm 25, married to the most patient man in the world (Ryan McAtee),  have the most adorable, abeit vain, cat in existance (Bridget), and get to rock out in the most wonderful band that I couldn't imagine life without. (Aria Sharp)<br/><br/>We can't afford a house yet, but we're working on it!<br/>I used to teach pre-school of all ages, specializing in ages 2-4, but due to the need of paying bills, I now work as a security guard for Emerson and Vance instead. <br/>I've taken nine computer courses during public school, but unfortunately didn't learn much from them since they were craptastic at the time, so instead I've taught myself HTML, adobe, outlook, word, etc, etc  C++, a little latin and a smattering of other languages. <br/><br/>I'm in the process of writing a gaming world called "Sanctum: The Fallout", that is for use with Adam Cerling's "<a href="http:www.grapevinelarp.com/EndsAndMeans" rel="nofollow">"Ends and Means</a>, and the date for our playtest of potentially 20-50+ people is set for January.   I'm both nervous and excited as since it has only been actually gaming for a few years now, and only recently that I've started to take leadership roles.<br/><br/>I'm an Alumni Volunteer for <a href="http://www.bbbs.org" rel="nofollow">Big Brothers, Big Sisters of America</a>, and when I'm not being a wife, gaming, working, volunteering, playing with a band, being a politcal activist or working with children, I run my own business,<a href="http://www.oraclemindandbody.com" rel="nofollow">Oracle: Mind and Body</a> as the alchemist, owner and marketing manager.   I still try to make time for writing and have a habit of writing theoretical musings and poetry that are surely destined to collect dust.   I do not consider myself terribly religious, but I am very spiritual, consider myself a christian, (jesus and all), and I do believe in divination and psychic ability.<br/><br/> <br/>All and all?  I'm just a big geek who lacks the ability send an e-mail or make  a post without having to edit it, or send a second one, has a love for music, gaming, kids, and learning about people,  This thread was a jackpot for my mind!<br/><br/>Sara.                        </div>

                            Didn't notice this thread until shutupgirl resurrected it.<br/><br/>I'm Matt Johnston and I live in Ireland. I've travelled over Europe and been to the US twice but all in all I love Ireland the most. I'm 34, happily single, heterosexual, have two kids, a girl aged 4 and a boy aged 2 that I am utterly devoted to, still married to their mom but we don't live together any more and we do get along fine. I'm tall, freckled and brown haired, charming, gorgeous, wonderfully good in the sack, terribly polite, helpful and dependable. It's true! I tend to be a bit stubbly and am pretty pleased that it's going a distinguished grey at my chin. Score one for me! Raised as a Roman Catholic but I've given up believing in all sorts of fairy tales since I was a child. I spent 3 years in the Army. I speak basic French and German and started learning Mandarin.<br/><br/>Workstuff<br/>I've got a degree in Genetics and postgrad qualifications in Computing and IT. I've done heaps of IT courses and for a little while was a Network Consultant for Nortel after being a Mac guy, a generic IT guy, a PC guy, a UNIX guy and a Network Guy. I used to teach pre-degree courses at my local technical college and I've done a few guest speaking and writing spots over the years. For the last 3 years I've been running my own IT company - we fix Macs. That's what we do. I've also started up a software company and I'm going to be launching two more companies next year. I like being busy.<br/><br/>Gaming<br/>My gaming history started with White Dwarf issue 55 which mesmerised me and also introduced me to some gamers in my school. I was 11. I still have relatively fond memories of the Spiderbite scenario for D&amp;D within. I'm a vigourous and experimental gamer, owning hundreds of books. I used to be an active member of TwoMoons MUSH as well as The Masquerade and City of Darkness MUSHes among others in the early 90s. I do miss it and it's ironic that I now have the time and the net connection when previously I had neither. I used to be President of my university gaming club and ran their convention, Q-CON for two very successful years. I started the gaming company Crucible Design and ran it from 1996 to 2001 publishing "The 23rd Letter", "SpaceNinjaCyberCrisis XDO" and "Zombi", all of which I still own. It feels a bit weird as while I was out of gaming, this whole "indie" scene started up yet back in the early 90s I was a major player in the indie scene.... I took a haitus of nearly 3 years as my company built up and my marriage failed but things are much better now. After the other guys in Crucible Design and I split, I started my own imprint LateGaming and produced 2 PDF games (Creed, Testament) and now run lategaming.com as a blog and game design...er...place. <br/><br/>I am a Mac user as mentioned above, but despite running my local Mac User Group since about 1997 and running the only Mac repair place in Northern Ireland, I'm not a Mac bigot. I write for 3 blogs now and spend altogether too much time talking to people online.                        </div>

                            You know Matt I think there is a copy of "SpaceNinjaCyberCrisis XDO" in the half price section in my local game shop. If there is I am going to have to get it just because now. I had seen the title, but never opened it up to look at it. I will now.                        </div>

                            Well, heck, since it's been resurrected I might as well jump in here and do a real intro.<br/><br/>I'm Kirsten Brodbeck, I'm 27, and I grew up in mid-Michigan (Alma, mostly, and went to Kalamazoo College).  I've been living in West Philly for the past 5 years and would like to stay here for a while.  I live in a rambly rowhouse apartment with Dave (my partner of 6+ years), two rats named Toxie and O'Malley, a couple of cranky budgies, around 2,000 books, and a basement full of power tools.  I'm a children's librarian, and Dave's a PhD student at U Penn in computer science.<br/><br/>I knit a lot of intricate sweaters and such (and a bunch of my gaming buddies are getting knit dice bags for Winter Holidays).  I read a LOT, tons of kids books (due to the job, but I'd be reading 'em anyway), lots of fantasy and sci fi.  I'm also hugely partial to Sherlock Holmes and Lord Peter Wimsey.  I watch a lot of PBS.  I have an affinity for good scotch and good beer.  Sometimes I get drunk and talk gaming theory at parties, and I actually have friends who think this is a good thing, or at least humor me.  I perform as a drag king under the names Pelvis Thrustello and Mad Cow Billy.  <br/><br/>I've only been gaming since July of this year, but I've come to realize I must have had a gamer residing fully-formed in my head.  It apparently fulfills a lot of creative urges that have been without outlet for some time.  A friend recruited me for a TSOY campaign in July, and I haven't looked back since.  It helped that I was stuck in an awful job at the time and would thus spend hours at work reading The Forge and Story Games instead of doing work... (I'm much happier now)  Now I'm still playing the aformentioned TSOY game on a generally weekly basis.  I'm also playing a monthly homebrew game run by my friend Corvus, and I'm planning on running The Mountain Witch next month.                        </div>

                            I'm Chris Bennett, 38 years old and living in Alameda, CA (close to SF).  I moved out here back in 1995 after a disappointing college career and several years "finding myself" (AKA working crappy jobs).  I was lucky enough to get into the video game business at the bottom rung, and have spent the past 11 years making cool games for companies like EA and Maxis.  Now I have an awesome job as producer and game designer making casual downloadable games at  <a href="http://www.playfirst.com" rel="nofollow">PlayFirst</a> in SF and get to take a ferry to work everyday!  Plus next year I am getting married to an awesome girl named Rachel who guides me through the tough times and embraces my passions.<br/><br/>I started playing RPGs back around 1980, but I never had a regular gaming group and the games didn't fulfill the expectations I had for them.  At some point I stopped playing for 15-20 years besides the occasional GURPS game.  Fast-forward to a year ago and my workmate going on and on about "indie games" and "The Forge" and "Burning Wheel".  I started to do a <b>lot</b> of reading and yeah, I drank the kool-aid.  There's some awesome stuff going on in this community and while I make my babysteps towards designing for paper-and-pencil, I am <b>awed</b> by the combined talent I see here everyday.  I also found an awesome game store in Oakland called <a href="http://www.endgameoakland.com/" rel="nofollow">EndGame</a>, and they have made me very welcome.  It's a second home, I tell ya.<br/><br/>I am very passionate about making and playing games, but I find myself drawn towards making games for "non-gamers" both in my professional career and in my hobby time.  I dream of the day that kids and adults have games that they can use to create exciting stories together.  I think we are moving in that direction and it's what gets me up in the morning.                        </div>

                            I'm Justin Grosvenor Smith, 29 of Roseville (Sacramento), California.  I am a life-long NorCal-er, I occaisionally use the word Hella (the true mark of NorCal.)  I am a fan of the Sac Kings, and I'm sad they are moving to Vegas.<br/>
I am married to a non-gamer-- Khamfong Khanrasa-- and have a soon-to-be 5 year old daughter.  Frankly, my wife is far more interesting than I am.<br/>
I went to Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo for a few years studying Mechanical Engineering before we had a disagreement about what constituted satisfactory progress toward my degree and they asked me to seek educational opportunities elsewhere.  That elsewhere was California State University, Sacramento, where I got my BA in Philosophy.  I can build an engine from scratch, and I have written award winning essays in Semantics (philosophy of language.)<br/>
I have a profound dislike for the California Air Resources Board.  They are deathly affraid someone, somewhere might enjoy their car, and they write laws to stop it.<br/>
I have had a number of shitty jobs, but I (mostly) love the one I have now: Admissions for a small culinary school.  I truly enjoy being able to help people build their careers, and I also enjoy the food.  I enjoy the food a bit too much in fact, as I tip the scales at about 230 these days.<br/>
In gaming, I started with Red-Box D&amp;D, and I still enjoy the occaisional dungeon hack.  I have just recently discovered indie gaming with the Burning Wheel, and the scales have fallen from my eyes.  I need deep involvement, immersion, and player-driven conflict.  Now I need to convince my gaming group of the same.<br/>
I don't listen to music.  Really, I don't.                        </div>

                            Last time I posted a brief biography on the web was 1995 and it still comes in the top ten search results on my name in Google. You can find it <a href="http://www.gamecabinet.com/biography/MartinHigham.html" rel="nofollow">here.</a> So I'm not going to post my age since it will be shortly wrong. All I'll say is that Thor is no longer the oldest person on this list.<br/><br/>So an update from the previous bio.<br/><br/>I still live in Wokingham , England and still work in software development but no longer as a freelancer. I am now married to my long time girlfriend. No children and non planned.<br/><br/>My role playing had died out by the mid 90's and was revitalised this year with the discovery of indie rpg's through Paul Tevis's "Have Games Will Travel". One of the primary reasons my previous role playing career died out was the amount of prep time require even for games such as Pendragon and so many of the new games reduce this dramatically if not entirely as well as being being highly enjoyable.<br/><br/>Back in the days of The Clash and Sex Pistols I fell in love with Punk Rock and still enjoy listening to a wide and eclectic mixture of music. <br/><br/>Since I am now working from home I spend little time commuting and reading. Most of my remaining reading time is spent reading new role playing games. When I have found the time to read fiction my current favourite author is Joe Lansdale. <br/><br/>I occassionally post to my <a href="http://www.ocasta.co.uk" rel="nofollow">blog</a> </div>

                            Hey Howdy,<br/><br/>My nameâ€™s Blake Hutchins.  Iâ€™m 43, turning gray at the temples and neck.  Does this make me a contender for oldest on the thread?  I live in Eugene, Oregon, U.S.A., with my lovely (and patient) wife, our two brilliant young daughters, and four extremely spoiled cats named Rogue, Hotspur, Hector, and Amoke.  Iâ€™ve been here since I came to Eugene to attend the U. of Oregon law school in 1990, and just sorta stuck among the Douglas firs and sword fern.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding the gray, Iâ€™m holding up pretty well.  I stay in good shape and at my basic set point can get out and run six miles any day of the week.  I figure Iâ€™d like to be around with all my teeth and most of my brain cells intact when my moppets grow up and start having their own kids.  I believe in quality over quantity, environmental responsibility, proactive social policy, and not assigning value based on material success.  Also, hot sauce is good, but not with bananas.<br/><br/>I was a State Department brat, so I lived in Sweden and Finland as a kid, alternating with northern Virginia, a place I loathe (no offense to any Virginians out there).  Went to high school in N. California.  At the University of California, Davis, I majored in International Relations, mostly because it was an interdisciplinary major.  I spent my junior year abroad in Lund, Sweden, where I became fluent in Swedish down to the dialect.  I was flattered that it took Swedes about 10 to 15 minutes of conversation before they suspected I wasnâ€™t Swedish.  And then they never guessed I was American.  Since I lived there as a young kid, itâ€™s really the place that feels like home.  Western Oregon evokes Scandinavia in much of its landscape, so thatâ€™s probably why Iâ€™ve put down roots here so easily.<br/><br/>I sometimes feel like the original jack of all trades, master of zip.  Iâ€™ve worked a number of different jobs.  Typesetter, firefighter, line cook, baker, basic labor, graphic designer.  I got a teaching credential in â€™88, taught middle school for awhile, then went to law school.  After law school, I worked as a librarian, a software company administrative manager, and (finally) a public defender in a rural Oregon county.  In 1998, I started at Dynamix, a computer game company in Eugene, where I wrote the story and backdrop for an epic video game sci-fi franchise (Starsiege, later Tribes).  Sierra closed Dynamix in 2001, and I started a new company with a few other ex-Dynamix folks.  We produced Enigma: Rising Tide, a WW2 alternate history naval action game.  After a couple of years there, I left that company to start as a tech support and sysadmin manager (and general counsel) with a more pedestrian software company.  I eventually became the COO, essentially, before finally leaving last spring to avoid becoming a heart attack victim.  Normally a pretty even-tempered, easy-going fellow, I encountered my limits on stress for the first time ever.<br/><br/>Iâ€™m now trying my luck as a full-time fiction writer and family caretaker, doing some consulting contract work on the side.  Weâ€™ll see how the writing venture goes.  Iâ€™m one of the winners of the Writers of the Future contest, and my story â€œThe Sword from the Seaâ€ appears in the just-released Volume 22â€”the first one in the anthology, no less.  Iâ€™m under no illusions about the prospects of supporting myself with fiction, but itâ€™s worth taking a shot at anyway.  I write SF, fantasy, and twisted humor.<br/><br/>RP-wise, I started playing blue book DnD way back in â€™77, a game that morphed into a hybrid of DnD and Runequest before I went off to college at UC Davis, California.  I dropped out of RP in college except for a couple of toe-dunks into The Fantasy Trip.  Came back to it in â€™87 with GURPS.  In law school I got into Ars Magica and Vampire.  Later did some homebrew cyberpunk, dove heavily into the rest of the WW games during the mid-â€˜90â€™s.  More of a GM than a player, though the best game I ever played in turned out to be an intensely political Werewolf chronicle.  After I started in the computer game industry and became interested in design, I did a little experimentation with Forge games and others, but nothing lasting came of it.  Iâ€™m more interested in play technique and facilitating creative agenda (i.e., Actual Play) than in producing my own game.  Over the last few years Iâ€™ve been an armchair gamer with occasional short-lived forays to try out non-trad game designs like The Pool, PTA, Story Engine, etc.  Iâ€™ve just started running a Dragon-Blooded Exalted game using a heavily-drifted Wushu conversion.  Weâ€™ll see how long that lasts, but itâ€™s looking promising for a long-term campaign.  Though I prefer rules-light games, I have this unholy itch to run Burning Wheel.<br/><br/>My wife is a sometime gamer.  She really loved the aforementoined Werewolf game, in which she participated.  Sheâ€™s interested in starting up again, which is cool.  We have a real challenge with a two-year old and a six-year old running underfoot, so Iâ€™m always interested in hearing from other gamer parents.<br/><br/>Letâ€™s see:  other interests include marathon running, European Renaissance martial arts (sword &amp; buckler), history (esp. the Battle of Britain and Battle of the Atlantic), politics (Iâ€™m a deep blue, far left progressive), oral storytelling, folk music, mythology and folklore, epidemiology, alternative energy and green living, musicals, the sociology of demographics and social change, and Pythonesque, scatological humor.<br/><br/>Favorite novels: Dune, Tai-Pan, Summerland, Nine Princes in Amber, A Song for Arbonne, Count Zero, The Lords of Discipline, Three Hearts and Three Lions, A Wizard of Earthsea, probably about fifty others.  Iâ€™m currently reading Kate Elliottâ€™s Crown of Stars series, which is surprisingly good in the George R.R. Martin vein (and complete!).  Kateâ€™s a local Eugene writer as well, which is cool.  Eugene turns out to be a hotbed of professional F&amp;SF writing talent.  I knew Johnzo through that circle, as it happens.  Brilliant writer, that guy.<br/><br/>Favorite tunes: Pretty much anything by Sorten Muld or Triakel.  Also listening to Cake, Enya, Evanescence, Dar Williams, Dead Can Dance, Jolie Holland, and about fifty other bands.  The whole iTunes phenomenon has made musical exploration easy as sin.<br/><br/>I really like this community, both for the creative output and the easy-going courtesy it extends.  Like Old Scratch, Iâ€™m a user of design and technique theory, not a designer.  Nice to have a place with solid, mature discussion that at the same time feels like a comfortable hangout where one can chew the fat.  A big thanks to Andy and all the rest of you.<br/><br/>Iâ€™ll sign off now, so I donâ€™t use ALL the available pixel space.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Blake                        </div>

                            Gods, people are adding so much about themselves that I feel my posts don't cover enough. <br/><br/>I'm married to a non-gamer retieree, I have two children, one a Lawyer/Mom and the other a riding instruter/ Biology Doctoral candidate.  5 grandchildren: twins 5 one 11 one 20 and one 24 who lives with us. My oldes grandson games but he thinks my stuff is stoopid and enjoys Rifts. <br/><br/>I am a non practicing atheist, who enjoys other religions and  their practices but has no faith. <br/><br/>I started with white box D&amp;D but had to play over the phone because none of my friends lived near enough to me to play face to face. We played fairly regularly in high school and into collage. D&amp;D, Traveller, CoC, were the big ones. Flashing Blades, Marrow Project, Top Secret, Aftermath were the couple of times ones and there were about a dozen others.<br/><br/>I have never been much of a joiner which has limited my play. I was at least partially responsible for the founding of two collage gameing groups at two universities but never joined either. <br/><br/>I think I said before that I have stopped gaming two or three times depending on how much you consider thinking about game design without playing. I was in a comitted and loving gaming group last year but they fled the country ( I honestly think it was the President's fault more than mine). I am in an every two weeks Tekumel group and thinking of hanging out a shingle to play pickup playtests at a local game shop. <br/><br/>By the way I married the mother of my high school sweetheart if that adds anything to my die roll.                        </div>

                            I'm glad this thread has ressurrected. Gets us newcomers on the social radar. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>So: I'm <b>Joel P. Shempert</b>, 31, divorced after a mercifully brief marriage, now in love with the most amazing woman in the world who I'm gonna marry someday. She's never gamed, but we've talked about it and she's interested, with what looks like a strong bias toward Narrativism (yay!). I live in Portland, Oregon. I puttered around community college for several years, mostly as a Music Major, with dabblings in journalism, philosophy, political science, and literature. I ran the usual gamut of fast food and retail jobs. I now work as a caregiver at an Adult FosterCare home for the developmentally disabled.<br/><br/>I sing in a choir of mostly-alumni volunteers from said community college. We're called <a href="http://www.unistus.net" rel="nofollow">Unistus</a> ("fantasy") and our fantasy is peace. We were inspired by the country of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonia" rel="nofollow">Estonia</a>, particularly by her 1991 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing_Revolution" rel="nofollow">Singing Revolution</a>, which turned away tanks with singing. No joke. We sing lots of Estonian music and go to Estonian Song Festivals. The music and the people are full of love. We're personal friends of people like composer <a href="http://www.emic.kul.ee/InglE/composers/Tormis,%20Veljo.htm" rel="nofollow">Veljo Tormis</a>, which is awesome. He writes songs filled with a deep and primal power and spiritual energy. Anyone who hasn't heard him should really check him out, his music's on Amazon.<br/><br/>I was raised very Christian by a Baptist minister and his wife. Grew up smug and know-it-all about it, then got out into "the world," and had my conceptions shattered. I've explored a lot of avenues and accumulated much knowledge and insight from diverse traditions, and put it all together to become. . .I have no idea. I've been working up from first principles and have "God is Love" firmly fixed; all else is up in the air. The Jesus and divinity thing, I'm wrestling with. Right now, my rough model is, "Jesus was an amazing and charismatic and possibly supernatural person whose Way is compelling and challenging," "Jesus shows what God is like through his words and actions," and "I believe I can talk to Jesus because, well, he's talked to me." I'm considering calling myself a "Yeshuan" to distinguish from the "Christ"-iness of Christianity. Fortunately I go to a very cool and accepting <a href="http://www.thebridge-pdx.org" rel="nofollow">church</a> where I don't have to live in fear from the repercussions of these explorations.<br/><br/><b>Other stuff that's important to me:</b> Art, beauty, self-expression, individualism, literature, fantasy, games, comics, truth, world-changing activism. As for that last one, I've had a hard time figuring out how to make that work; I can barely follow world and domestic news, much less do anything about it. And I have personal difficulty in that politics isn't really THE THING that I want to care about; I see it as the thing that makes all the other things possible. Regarding the other stuff, some specifics, in scattershot fashion: JRR Tolkien, J.D. Salinger, Rembrandt, Mozart, C.S. Lewis, Hayao Miyazaki, Fyodor, Dostoevsky, Joss Whedon, Five Iron Frenzy, Neil Gaiman, Sting, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katharine_Blake" rel="nofollow">Katharine Blake</a>, Shakespeare, Socrates, Vincent Van Gogh, Veljo Tormis (see above), The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%A1in_B%C3%B3_C%C3%BAailnge" rel="nofollow"><i>TÃ¡in BÃ³ CÃºailnge</i></a>, The <i>Psalms</i> of (among others) David, Robert Heinlein, Final Fantasy, Kevin Smith, Mr. Children, <a href="http://iboxpublishing.com" rel="nofollow">Mark Oakley</a>, Ursula Le Guin, <a href="http://www.konami.jp/kojima_pro" rel="nofollow">Hideo Kojima</a>, Poor Old Lu, Alan Moore, Beethoven, Steven Lawhead, Ben Harper, John Stuart Mill, the Gorillaz, Frank Herbert, John Stewart, G.K. Chesterton, pre-soulless George Lucas.<br/><br/><b>Another noteworthy:</b> My friends, Todd and Angie have totally pioneered new ways of doing music; first at the Church I go to, they head up the <a href="http://www.agentsoffuture.com" rel="nofollow">"worship music,"</a> and it is totally off the hook in ways I cannot even describe. Totally breaking out of old forms to make it relevant and alive. Second, the've formed and hosted the <a href="http://www.soundclick.com/bands/pageartist.cfm?bandID=603229" rel="nofollow">Ink Brethren</a> (that's my washed-out face below the logo), a gathering using techniques for <i>spontaneous group songwriting.</i> It's liberating and hella fun. And loaded with interesting parallells to roleplaying, I think.<br/><br/><b>Last noteworthy, I promise:</b> I'm involved with the <a href="http://www.sca.org" rel="nofollow">SCA</a> (Society for Creative Anachronism), a bunch of Medieval reenactment folks. It's way fun. It's equal parts historical education and hard partyin'. I'm a Bard. And when I say that, I don't mean it in a D&amp;D "I'm a half-elven fighter thief" way, or even in a "I dress as a Bard" way. The SCA has afforded me the opportunity to <i>be</i> something I've always yearned for. I sing, tell stories, recite poetry. I participated in my first Bardic festival this October, and won high honor and fast friendship. Life is good.<br/><br/>I think that about does it. . .except maybe a brief (I promise!) <b>roleplaying history:</b> I started at about 13 with heavily Pawn-stance (which is to say, "Glorified boardgame") Marvel Superheroes, then Middle Earth Roleplaying (MERP) from ICE. The fact that that D&amp;D was Satanic and Forbidden played some part in both those choices. Somewhere in the midst of MERP the idea that I could actually play a <i>character</i> with real personality, goals, desires, dialogue, etc. emerged, and got off to a rocky start as it met with. . .uneven support from my fellows. We also played Heroes Unlimited, hastily selected by me as an antidote to the "too loose" MSH, and we spent several years trying to play superheroes with a derivative of a third-rate D&amp;D clone.<br/><br/>That group dissolved after high school due to people moving and being unable to get together often enough. A couple years into college I met new friends, and played DD 2E with them, bringing with me my two brothers from the childhood group. This has been my group ever since, albeit with some notable shakeups and roster changes. We play D&amp;D 3x and Big Eyes Small Mouth run by one GM, more D&amp;D run by another, and Over the Edge run by me. The games carry varying degrees of satisfaction withme, with a volatile oscilation between awesomeness and agenda clash boredom/occasional hostility.<br/><br/>I discovered the Forge and Hippie Games about a year ago. I read about Narr and went "Oh! So <i>that's</i> what I've been yearning for all this time and pursuing in an entirely unproductive manner!" I grabbed PTA in January and have been playing a season with a couple of non-previous-gamer friends. A rocky, stumbling start, but with steadily-increasing success and much enjoyment. I got Heroquest and played in Fred Wolke's short-lived <a href="http://random.average-bear.com/RegainTheStars/HomePage" rel="nofollow">Regain the Stars</a> IRC campaign, along with Mike Holmes and others. I miss it. I've purchased Trollbabe, Sorceror, and DitV, but have yet to play them.<br/><br/>Ok, I'm done. Hope it's interesting. I certainly enjoyed writing it, but you know what they say about everyone's favorite subject. . .<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>

                            I've been meaning to post this for a while...<br/><br/>My name is Rich and I'm reinforcing the age bracket for the site by being 31.<br/><br/>I've been using my real name online for as long as message boards have let you put a space in your UserID.  I sometimes feel like making something really cool sounding up whenever people ask what my real name is: "Yeah, I post under the name Rich Stokes, but my real name is Legolas Dragonslayer."  Something like that.<br/><br/>You can add me to the Secular Jewish posse.  Probably count as a Humanist or something, I never really dwell on it to be honest.  My Dad once said something about my family being from Romania, but that's not really something that's important to me.<br/><br/>I was born in Kent, grew up in London and I now live in Southampton, England with my girlfriend, Claire. She just got into gaming earlier this year. She'd been badgering me to let her play for a while and in February I started a new campaign, she joined in and now there's no turning back. She's working of a game she wants to run soon, which will be interesting.  We aren't married because we don't plan to ever have kids.  In the social strata we live in, people only ever really seem to get married if they want kids.  Since I hate kids, animals and almost everything else there doesn't seem much point.<br/><br/>I have a degree in Acoustic Engineering, which probably sounds a lot more interesting than it actually is.<br/><br/>I'm one of the creators of <a href="http://totl.net" rel="nofollow">TotL.net</a> and Microsith.com, except some evil domain squatter own Microsith.com now.  I once convinced the world that I'd built a computer that was powered by potatoes, but that's not something I'm entirely proud of.<br/><br/>By day, I'm either a Systems Administrator or De facto IT Manager depending on who you ask. I work for a company which manufactures parts for ships. The actual product is very dull, but there's one in every single nuclear submarine run by either the US or UK navies, so it's simultaneously very dull and very secret.<br/><br/>I've been gaming for something over 20 ish years.  First game I played was RuneQuest.  I think we played Dragon Warriors after than and we finally graduated to Merp.  First one I bought was the Games Workshop edition of Merp in the purple box.  I was 11 when I bought that.  I've always liked the idea of wargames, but actually playing them was mostly very disappointing.  Games like M'44 and Battleground: Fantasy Warfare seem to have a much better effort/fun ratio and that works for me.  If only I could actually beat Claire at either game occasionally, that would be nice.<br/><br/>That ratio of effort to fun is what I'm all about.  I think one of the reasons that these MMOs are popular is that they are so little effort.  For a game to appeal to me it has to be easy and rewarding or fairly easy really damn rewarding.<br/><br/>I have written games, but don't consider myself a designer as much as a tinkerer.  I aspire to be like a mechanic that understands what goes on in a car engine rather than the engineer that builds the car, if that makes sense?<br/><br/>Other than gaming? Videogames, I'm a real console nut.  I have pretty much every console made since the Sega Master System and play them on an AV projector in my lounge. I know the Japanese for Yes, No, Save, Load, Save and Continue, but nothing much else.<br/><br/>Plus booze. I'm a real beer ponce, I hunt down imported beers from all over the world.  This makes me fat.  Since I stopped spending every weekend at raves in the countryside or dismal industrial clubs and started sleeping on a regular basis I've become really rather out of shape.<br/><br/>I used to read a lot of comics, but find that I have less time and enthusiasm for them these days. I still keep up with Stray Bullets and Fell though. I never liked superheros though.<br/><br/>And I like to cook, much to Claire's delight. If only I'd crack the washing dishes afterward thing...                        </div>

Really? Maybe we're emplying different definitions of "effort". . .granted, I haven't been an active MMORPer since Everquest i, but what turned me OFF was the effort required for fun: the busywork, the loads and loads of running everywhere, the molasses-slow level treadmill. . .I understand WOW is brisker, but still. . .

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Melinglor</cite><cite>Posted By: Rich Stokes</cite>I think we played Dragon Warriors after than [snip]</blockquote>Never heard of that one. Who published it? What's it like?<br/>It was an early Fantasy game, published in the UK about 20 odd years ago.  It was published by Corgi Books I think, who were a kids book company.  It was sold in book shops and supermarkets alongside the Fighting Fantasy stuff.  It was a core book, about 200 pages like a paperback novel.<br/><br/>I think it was available in Australia as well.<br/><br/>For me, it occupies the same place in my heart that red box D&amp;D does for a lot of people.  See, when I was a kid, D&amp;D wasn't on sale by the tills at ADSA, but Dragon Warriors <i>was</i>.<br/><br/>Good times <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>

Ah, yes.  I was referring to the effort required to actually get the game up and running.<br/><br/>Turn on computer<br/>Click Icon<br/>Wait for game to load and connect to server<br/>Play<br/><br/>is much easier than:<br/><br/>Arrange for 3+ mates to come over on the same night<br/>Hope no-one cancels<br/>Prepare adventure<br/>Play<br/><br/>My computer breaks down way less often than one of my players has to cancel. (I am cheating though, because keeping computers running is my profession, but you see where I'm going with that)<br/><br/>A good system can reduce the effort of prep and increase the amount of fun I have.  If only someone could make something that would increase the regularity with which the players attended...                        </div>

                            Dragon Warriors... ahhh.... I remember picking up book 2 (sorcerors and mystics?) thinking it was a choose your own adventure book (I was hooked on the Fighting Fantasy stuff at the time), as it was paperback sized and had spells and 'game book' written on it. At first I was disappointed when I realised I couldn't actually play through the book on my own. Then, my head exploded.<br/><br/>Never actually got to play them, alas... but I sure did read em a hell of a lot. That's your gateway game right there:  an rpg disguised as another product!                        </div>

                            My name is Rafael Chandler. I'm 32. I live in North Carolina.<br/><br/>I've been working as a writer and designer in the video game industry since 2000. I worked for EA and Ubisoft, then went <a href="http://www.rafaelchandler.com" rel="nofollow">freelance</a>. In addition, my wife and I run a <a href="http://www.mediasunshine.com" rel="nofollow">consulting company</a>.<br/><br/>I've been married for three years. It's great. One kid, a little pink snorty baby. He's a lot of fun.<br/><br/>I listen to metal. I watch The Wire, BSG, and Heroes. I like to read books by guys like George V. Higgins, John le CarrÃ©, and Clive Barker. I play a lot of video games -- I've got maybe sixteen consoles, stuff like the Sega Master System and the NEC Turbografx-16. And the current-gen stuff too.<br/><br/>Used to smoke and drink and eat fast food all day. Now I eat healthy and get lots of exercise. When the doctors told me that the tumor in my throat was benign, I figured that you only get so many lucky days in your life. So I made some adjustments.<br/><br/>-- Rafael                        </div>

                            Since this thread got necro'd back from obscurity (where it apparently lay before I started reading these forums) I've been intending to post and let y'all know a little bit about my good self.  I actually started doing that some days ago but, I'm sorry to say, the fickle whim of my laptop keyboard intervened and caused my partially written epic to be BELETED!, Strong Bad-style.  Disheartened by this set-back I put away the post for another day and now another day has arrived (and I'm bored at work) so I shall once again attempt to inflict upon you a little something about me.<br/><br/>First point, I ramble.  A lot.  (Just in case you didn't figure that out from the above.)  Bear that in mind when reading the below ;o) .<br/><br/>Anyway, my name is (as you can probably guess) Geoff Hall.  I'm 27 years of age and live near Bristol in the south west of England.  I'm not a pirate born and bred though, I grew up a touch south of Croydon (that's south London for you foreign-types) and spent most of my life there, barring a couple of lengthy stints in Birmigham for various university based hi-jinks.  More on that later.  I'm of average height and build with blue eyes and hair that I still describe as red but, well, I can't actually begin to give an accurate colour for anymore.  It was red when I was at school, it varies between red, blonde and brown now depending on the weather, the time of year and, I assume, the alignment of the stars and planets.  I'm married to a wonderful (if slightly insane) woman called Steph and we have 4 kids.  The older 2 are my step-kids, Darren (nearly 15, bloody hell!) and Jordan (or Jay, he's 11.)  The younger 2 are rather more recent and are mine (in the biological sense, all 4 are mine in the emotional and responsibility senses) and they are Cameron (who is 3) and Finaly (who is coming up to 7 months).  Steph and I have been married for nearly 4 1/2 years now and have known each other for a bit over 6.  We currently live in a rented and immensely cool old house in a tiny village.  To an extent I love the place but, well, we can't go <i>anywhere</i> without using the car, which is a royal pain in the arse, so much so that we're looking to move and actually (finally) buy a palce of our own.  Unfortunately having 4 kids (along with 6 cats and a frickin' great german shepard dog) is going to make finding a suitable property in our price range problematical at best... (Curse you UK housing market, curse you to hell!)  Anyway, as you can imagine things get rather hectic at home and free time is something of a rarity for me (which is why Anarchy will be lucky to be ready for DragonMeet 2007 and why Finger on the Button is still just a single LJ entry) but that's okay, the kids, animals and wife are all good <img alt=":o" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/open_mouth.png" title=":o"/>) .<br/><br/>So, other than getting married and producing offspring what have I done with my life?  Well I attended school (as you do) and got a bunch of GCSEs, went to college and got another GCSE (Astronomy in this case) and some A-Levels.  From there I went on to the University of Birmingham to study Physics with Astrophysics.  I did one of those (relatively) new fangled MSci 4 year undergrad degrees and netted myself a 2 (i) with honours at the end of it.  Perhaps more importantly, though, it was during my time at uni that I got into roleplaying and met some of the people that I'm still friends with and still game with today (including Andrew Kenrick, to name check someone here who has an actual game or few published ;o) .)  After that I moved back to Croydon and in with my then girlfriend (and now wife), bummed around working for the local council for bit before deciding that I needed to earn some 'bread' and get myself a career.  To that end it was back to Birmingham where I did a postgrad masters degree in The Physics and Technology of Nuclear Reactors.  So, I can now put MSci and MSc after my name should I so desire.  Aren't I lucky?  Anyway, from there I ended up working in BNFL and, when that got split up, BNG (the Project Services part) and that's where I am now, writing and running radiation shielding codes and performing radiological consequence assessments in order to facilitate the decommissioning of the UK's ageing fleet of Magnox reactors.  Of course I'm also acutely hacked off with my job and the direction that the company is taking and fully intend to quit next year and go and work with Steph on her business (she sells ballgowns and jewellery on ebay/the internet).<br/><br/>"But what about the gaming!?!" I hear you cry.  As I said earlier I'm actually comparatively new to the hobby.  I only started gaming after D&amp;D 3rd Ed. came out.  It was recognised that the uni RPG society would likely get a significant membership boost with the advent of 3rd Ed (and it did) and I lived in a house of roleplayers by that point.  Andrew wanted to playtest the game before running a campaign for the society so he roped the other 2 Rpers into it and I volunteered after checking out the book.  I ended up playing a ranger (it was only later that I came to realise that 3rd Ed rangers were mechanically busted, I was new, so sue me :op) and had great fun.  I then got drunk and joined another 3rd Ed game that was starting up, this time as a Bard (yes, I picked 2 of the mechanically weakest 3rd Ed classes, sod off ;o) .)  To say that I had fun playing Owyn (my ranger) and Jayce (my bard) would be something of an understatement.  I had an absolute blast and it wasn't too long before I was hooked.  Since those heady days I've tried quite a few games and moved away from my d20 roots and now find myself drawn more and more towards the small press scene.  In fact at the DragonMeet just gone I ended up buying 7 indie games and already owned DitV, tMW, Sorcerer, TSoY and Dead of Night.  I now have an insane amount of reading and playing to be getting on with!  Of course I've not stuck soley to the RPG side of gaming.  In fact I was very big into Magic at one point and still have a couple of shoeboxes worth of cards.  I think my favourite CCG was the B5 one though.  I keep intending to break it out again and play but I'm damned if I can remember how and I've got so many cards and no idea how to make an effective deck anymore!  I'm also getting more and more into stand alone games now like board games (I've recently purchased Warrior Knights, TI 3rd Ed and Beowulf) and non-collectible card games (Three Dragon Ante, Chrononaughts, etc.) which I can play with my family (Darren, the 14 year old, is into roleplaying but Jay really isn't and nor is Steph and, at 3 years and 7 months, Cam and Finn are a touch young just yet!)  It's a rare week that I don't end up playing <i>something</i> with the kids (and frequently one of my friends who lives in Bath and, if we're playing Beowulf and she's not too busy, Steph.)<br/><br/>Finally (on a similar note) I'm trying to make the jump from player to publisher.  All of the rocking games that people are producing these days are pretty inspiring and I've got the odd idea that i think is cool so I figure, what the hell, I can give it a shot too.  I have 2 games in the works, Anarchy (a game about a future, dystopian Britain where the players play terrorists/revolutionaries trying to bring down the fascist government) and Finger on the Button (I don't know what the hell this is going to be yet!)  I don't get a whole lot of time to work on them so they're not exactly moving at a great clip but Anarchy is pretty much ready for some mechanical playtesting, something that I hope to do soon.<br/><br/>So, yeah, that's probably far more information than anyone needed to know about me and, on that note, I'll end this post.  Peace.                        </div>

                            Hey there, my name is Don Corcoran.  I'm 37 years old and have been gaming since 1978.  The same person introduced me to my other love, martial arts and combat in all it's forms, however the cerebral is winning it's battle against the physical.<br/><br/>I live with my lovely wife, two dogs and two cats in a row home in Philadelphia, PA.  <br/><br/>I am an application trainer and senior help desk analyst in the 9th largest law firm in Philadelphia.  Despite it being law it's a very positive environment and I don't dread going to work.  My wife is a low level analyst for the National Board of Medical Examiners.  If your a physician chances are you had to take one of their tests to get liscenced to practice.  Her supervisor is a psychometrician which I was disappointed to learn had nothing to do with psychometry.<br/><br/>I love driving and travel and long to visit Europe and Asia.<br/><br/>I dig writing but I am a stronger idea man than a writer.  I tend to be very ADD on projects and get easily distracted which has led to the downward spiral of hundreds of cool projects.  I am a poor self motivator and look for support mechanisms to keep me on the path.<br/><br/>My wife games more than almost anyone I know save myself.  We maintain about three games a week, although only recently has it been at all regular.  Gaming is my third love (God and my wife take the top spots but I can't say it's not a juggling act sometimes).  I own thousands of books in over 300 systems (and thanks to many of the folk on this list, growing by the week).  I have read them all and played 90% of the collection.  I have demoed games at cons offically for DP9, AEG, Iron Crown, White Wolf, WotC, IMAGINE, Black Dragon Press, and a handful of others and have minor credits in a few other publications for development, playtesting and minor contributions.  The Burning Wheel is my gaming god and I am adapting offical rules for the Artesia RPG to be played with BW.<br/><br/>I have several blogs (I too am an ametuer HTML/ASP developer) that I have just started after being on LiveJournal for a few years.  Anything else you'd like to know?                        </div>

                            (Heh, I get the feeling I'm posting only in the community/about the forum threads, but whatever...)<br/><br/>My name is Aaron, I'm 22 and I have neither job nor much of an education, although I meant to change that for a while now. I'm currently living in Langenzersdorf, Austria, which is more or less right next to Vienna, where I went to the equivalent of High School before finally dropping out in the last year out of a combination of lazyness, depression and "too in love to care". Since then, I worked various low-pay sorta-students jobs, bought and read a huge amount of books, did my mandatory service for Austria as a paramedic at the Austrian Red Cross, did a bit of gaming, drawing, painting, writing and idea collecting (Though not nearly enough, in my opinion.), had quite a few nervous breakdowns (Way to many of those for my taste.) and spent much time expanding my sexual horizon.<br/><br/>I have an incredible girlfriend who was the reason I was "too in love to care", we've been together for roughly five years now and it looks like we're on our way towards another five years. Before getting together in a strange, very complicated, very awkward but in hindsight terribly cute and romantic way, we were first "friends" and then "best friends" ever since ages 10-12, when we first met in the train on the way to school. For years while we just friends, I had a terrible, terrible crush on her, which resulted in angst-filled journal entries, sad poetry and very depressing pictures, although it's, again in hindsight, very cute and romantic. (In a way, it feels really nice to be the guy who fell in love with his female best friend and not only got together with her but is now, five years later, in a great relationship with her, filled with fun, love and naughtiness.)<br/><br/>EDIT: The last few years, I got heavily into this "internet" thing and developed a massive hard-on for the whole Social Software/Networking/Indie/DIY/PoD/Forum/...-thingy and now try to suck up every bit of information on stuff that connects people, makes doing your own thing easier and so on. Maybe it just appeals to the hopeless nerd in me but I really like some of the development towards geography-independent social circles and I can't wait for more mobile ways to connect to the internet, to make this kind of stuff even easier. My heads bustling with ideas about connecting people, wether it's my halfbaked idea for finally starting an Indie-focused community here in Austria or the one about playing around with wireless, wiki/forum/chat-based communities for "meatspace" locations like bars, gaming clubs and so on. Of course, because it's easier to have an idea then to actually do something about it, nothing has come from them so far. <br/>(Although I sold a friends mother on the whole Indie/PoD idea, so I guess thats a win. ^_^ )<br/><br/>I started gaming way before I knew that there are things called "roleplaying games", when I was about 10-14 and learned that some of my (much older) friends played this strange game called "Das Schwarze Auge" (The Dark Eye). I read the books and was fascinated and so I borrowed the starter box and just tried running a game for (IIRC) my brother, my older male cousin and his half-sister. It was a complete disaster, I have no idea what I really had to do and the whole thing ended in a near party kill. After that, I didn't really follow gaming until much later, probably at about 15-16, when I overheard to older class-mates one row behind me talk about something called "Shadowrun". (Before that, I had read an interesting SR novel called "Wiener Blei" and so knew that setting without ever realizing that it was a roleplaying game.) I asked them about this and they explained that Shadowrun was a "Roleplaying Game" like DSA/TDE, and that they were running a game. I've been hooked ever since, although my tastes have changed. (Or more likely haven't changed, I just found games that fit my tastes better then Shadowrun.)                        </div>

                            i have been avoiding it, i am terrible at bio's. <br/><br/>ahh lets see, my name is Daniel Chiavaroli. I am 31 and a recent (6 months ago)transplant from Harrisburg, PA to Carrboro, NC. <br/><br/>i was not aware, until i read the 30 yrs of DND book, how long i'd been a gamer.  i remember being excited for the 2nd ed Monster Manual 2 to come out.  I played DND for several years in HS. I decided it was too static and picked up Shadowrun and WoD for a while. I was eventually lured back to midnight sessions of DND in college. I forget exactly how i stumbled across BW, but it has lead me, meandering into the indie games world. <br/><br/>Other Things: i'm a comic book nerd, a big one.  It was very long ago my mother decided to infect me with her vile pack-rattery, <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>.  she marched me down to the local news agency and set up a pull service for Batman, the Flash and Superman.  i read them for a while and evolved to the X-flavor of the month. I eventually stopped reading "capes" all together, which earned me a good natured hard time from the store owners in PA. <br/><br/>I' m also in the SCA, i only mention it because Melinglor mentioned it.  I have been much less enamored of it as of late.  My group in Pa had no time for people that wanted to play royals, and it seems like thats all they want to do here.  Thee's and Thous and M'Lady.  <br/><br/>I have been a techie of one type or another since 1998 and i am working at UNC's help desk right now.  I have a BFA in Related Arts from some tiny cowtown Uni in PA called Kutztown.  Related Arts was the easy out degree, "pick 3 disciplines and do them". I picked English, Theater and music.  I know, my grammar and sentence structure does not say...ENGLISH MAJOR..but my writing is much more conversational. Also, i seem to have slept through the nuts and bolts of language in highschool. How does an English/theater/music guy become a techie, might be your next question.  In college i spent a great deal of time with some proto-geeks that had removed one of the beds in a dorm room to put more computers in. <br/><br/>Let's see what else, i moved to NC to be with my lady, Abbey. She is a Library Science grad student at UNC. She is from California but  met on tribe.net (internet romance ftw). we've been together almost 2 years, no children, one bitchy little cat and lovable mutt dog. She loves boardgames and is interested in RPGing but it was a "boys night" activity with all her ex'es.                        </div>

                            I'm 23 years old, so on the younger end of the users here.  White male.  Name's Dan Riley.  I grew up in Massachussettes and Connecticut, then joined the Air Force.  Went to school at the Defense Language Institute in Monterey CA where I studied Korean for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week.  I... uh... enjoyed that a lot more than the description might make you think, because I'm really all about language at heart.  After that I lived in South Korea for 2 years, which was really pretty damn cool.  Especially when I got to attend a semester of college at Yonsei University and live as a civilian for 3 months in Seoul.  After that it was back to California for another year and a half, though in a much less-nice part of the state.  I just got out of the military in December and now I'm with my family in Georgia (they moved here while I was in Korea) looking to go back to college.<br/>
<br/>
So, other than roleplaying, I'm interested in... well, everything, really.  I speak, read, and write Korean fluently.  I speak Japanese passably but unfortunately am almost completely illiterate.  I plan on moving on to Mandarin Chinese once I've mastered Japanese.  I took 5 years of Spanish in high school and managed to remember hardly a word. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>  I read a lot, collect movies and television shows on DVD, and play a lot of roleplaying games, video games, and board games.<br/>
<br/>
Music is a huge part of my life.  I listen to everything at least a little bit, but identify most strongly with indie and alternative stuff.  Favorite bands are Pearl Jam, Radiohead, Death Cab For Cutie, The Yeah Yeah Yeahs, The Strokes, The Shins, Snow Patrol, Aimee Mann, and Ani DiFranco, among others.  Since I was introduced to the magic of the iPod, I'm listening to music almost literally every waking minute that I'm not actually interacting with someone.  I play the bass guitar, not particularly spectacularly.<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, I read "pretentious" literature, collect independent movies, and listen to independent music.  Indie games and I were pretty much a perfect match. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Well, I can't think of a better first post than introducing myself. My name's John Anderson and I'm 37 years old. I live in London and work part-time as an EMT for the London Ambulance Service and am in my final year of a full time BA Politics at Goldsmiths College, University of London. The thought of going back to work full-time fills me with absolute horror!<br/>
<br/>
I was born here to service parents (both in the RAF) and the family emigrated to New Zealand when I was 6 after the reality of Europe becoming an irradiated glowing wasteland seemed to be getting more likely. Happily that didn't happen and I spent a wild childhood in NZ living north of Auckland, in Christchurch and in Greymouth, the most god-forsaken place on Earth. <br/>
<br/>
Christchurch was were my gaming took off as the Christchurch wargaming society and the University of Canterbury gaming society allowed me to meet like-minded wargamers and roleplayers. I spent many a happy evening (and sometimes weekend) playing Harn, Traveller, WFRP and many many more...good times.<br/>
<br/>
Returning to the UK when there were no jobs in NZ and I drifted from the obligatory "Kiwi barman in England" role to assistant manager of a pub in Barnes, west London before realising that that role wasn't for me. A  short stint doing aid work in Croatia during the war led to meeting my partner for 13 years, Kelly. We then headed off to the Slovak Republic for a two-year stint teaching English and generally drinking far too much with the ex-pat teaching community.<br/>
<br/>
Back in the real world and I've been working with the LAS doing stupid shifts for the past 10 years and pretty much stopping my gaming as I was totally unable to commit to even weekly games (Bloody shift work!). I've since managed to return to gaming regularly since being a slack-arsed student and have discovered the joys of a different style of play from my Christchurch days. I'm predominantly an Intarweb loiterer with my nom de plume popping up on the harnforum, the forge, the burning wheel forum and now here. I notice the same old names popping up.<br/>
<br/>
While I've managed to collect alot of games and gaming stuff in the past twenty-odd years, I've certainly become more indie-orientated of late. I'm a BW/BE gamer currently playing once a week with a lovely bunch of lads who've been playing together for years. Tomorrow begins a BW game set in the world of Glen Cook's Black Company. <br/>

                            Hi All,<br>
<br/>
My name is Ryan Johnson and I am a 33 year old male living in Clawson, Michigan, a northerly suburb of Detroit. I am happily married as of april 2006 to my wife, Amnouy, who has a masters in computer sciences and currently a programmer. Being From Thailand I've had myself a few interesting trips out east and we've had all kinds of fun going through the mountains of paperwork involved with US immigration.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in Clawson, then after high school took a tour in the US Navy before returning back to Michigan to resume my education. After a year long process of gathering the investors and local town support in Lansing, MI to get a large scale night club business plan rolling had failed, I had business in my blood. So a couple months thereafter, in Feb of 97, myself and few others got serious about taking the Guild of Blades Publishing Group (which to that point had only published a gaming club zine and a photo copied minis rule set) and turning it into a real game publishing business. I am currently the Guild's President and it is my full time career and livelihood, other than a bit of side money I make doing a little consulting on the side. (though my wife has a very good job implementing and managing CRM systems, so in 2007 it may be a toss up who is the primary bread winner....).<br/>
<br/>
For the first 6-7 years the Guild of Blades was a part time gig, so I bounced around a bit in my other professional experiences. Of my most notable positions during that time period I was a brand manager for one dot com tech property, the director of marketing for another dot com start up and marketing manager for a trucking company.<br/>
<br/>
My gaming experiences began at the age of 13 when I had begun designing something of a solitaire board/rpg game system. After a while I showed it to one of my friends who happened to already be a D&amp;D player, so D&amp;D roped me in early. But I quickly expanded my gaming tastes to games like Risk, Axis &amp; Allies, Diplomacy and then into wargames with my favorite being World in Flames by the Australian Design Group. From the start I was always designing games, mostly RPGs, board and war games. Though oddly enough, as broke college kids who couldn't afford to buy into expensive miniature games, the first game published under the Guild of Blades was a house minis game initially designed to give our own gaming group a cheaper minis gaming option. These days the company keeps me very busy so I don't get to game as much, but we have a group that is currently playing the old FASA Star Trek RPG set in an Mirror Universe style setting around the Enterprise (most recent tv show) period and we play via VOIP since our players are spread over three states. I get to play our MMO online games 1483 Online and Thermopylae Online, but thats about it. Having recently moved, I am now happy to have a full sized basement where I am in the process of setting up a nice wargaming area and I WILL get to play World in Flames again!!!! :)<br/>

                            Howdy, all.<br/><br/>I'm 37, a happy Jew, live in Minneapolis in the occasionally frozen North, and started gaming back in 1982 when my parents bought me the dear ol' Moldvay Red Box Basic set for my 12th birthday. It would still be three more years before I had a mullet...<br/><br/> I have a BA in English Lit, and taught English to grades 7-12 for the last five years. When it became obvious that <i>that</i> just wasn't gonna work out, I briefly considered becoming an architect or a computer programmer, but instead ended up currently making my living as a diversity trainer and freelance writer for <a href="http://www.progroupinc.com/site/page/pg1682-pn_Diversity_Training_and_Consulting.html" rel="nofollow">this company</a>. I also just started my own <a href="http://wanderingscholar.com/" rel="nofollow">tutoring business</a>. Teaching was a love/hate thing that just about made me insane, but I did manage to run a gaming group with some students afterschool for a couple of years; we started out playing <i>Tunnels &amp; Trolls</i> and ended up with a system that was pretty much equal parts <i>Fighting Fantasy</i> and <i>The Mountain Witch</i>, so it wasn't a complete waste...<br/><br/>I was in a band called <i>Passage</i> for four years in the latter half of the 90's, in which I played guitar, wrote all of the lyrics, and did some back-up singing. We were a six-piece with mostly acoustic instruments inluding (wait for it...) a <a href="http://www.rtpnet.org/~hdweb/" rel="nofollow">hammered dulcimer</a>. We played everywere there was to play in Minneapolis, and it was a freakin' blast. Lots of free beer, and we put out a CD that I can, thank God, still listen to without wincing. <br/><br/>I've been married to the same bee-yoo-tee-ful woman for creeping up on nine years. We have a hilarious three year-old who's <i>obsessed</i> with the Hot Wheels AcceleRacers movies, which aren't as bad as you might think. Really. We also have a new child due in September, after the arrival of which I will join the ranks of Stay At Home Dads (I think there should be a Guild, or Brotherhood, or SOMEthing...)<br/><br/>I met my wife doing theater, which I is another one of my interests, along with reading, reading and more reading. I also speak, read and write pidgin Hebrew, and wrestle wolves.<br/><br/>One of these statements is false.<br/><br/>Aaron<br/><br/>*Edited because, well, the forum software didn't like my link to the AceleRacers link on Wikipedia...                        </div>

                            I'm Dan Owsen, I live in the Seattle area, married with children and old (41 at last count).  I work at a video game company on their website and so you might say I also play games for a living.  My main hobby is playing games, I play board games like Advanced Squad Leader and GMT strategy games, "Euro" games like Settlers of Catan, computer games (current favorite is Eve Online) and video games on Wii and Nintendo DS.  I'm an old school RPGer, used to play a ton of D&amp;D and Classic Traveller, recently have been getting back into it with GURPs, but looking for something different too...  I also like to read history (ancient, medieval, military and religious history), comic books, HP Lovecraft and friends and sci-fi/fantasy, and drink a lot of wine or beer.                        </div>

                            I'm Fredrik Sellevold, a 30 year old (1976) Norwegian from Trondheim.  I have my Master Degree in Science &amp; Technology Studies, writing a thesis on  library automation in the 1970s. Sometimes I get pangs of regret that I did not become an actual librarian. In the future, I wouldn't mind working at the state archive, but in the present I work as a Technical Oracle, dispensing words of computer wisdom to the confused masses. After finishing the degree I teleported to England to test the view from another another angle, and so I spent a year doing Tech Support in Nottingham. For Norwegian customers. That's globalisation, folks. <br/>
<br/>
I began my roleplaying career in 1992, GMing MERP and playing in a few runs of RECON (incidentally, it was only earlier this year I discovered that Recon is not actually supposed to take place in Vietnam). I moved over from MERP to RoleMaster not long after and kept running random adventures in Middle Earth until I shifted to the Shadow World around -96. That was also the year I first accessed the internet, and I've stayed hooked up to it ever since. Among my first actions online was subscribing to the Shadow World email list; that's where I first crossed words with Mike Holmes, which would eventually lead me to HeroQuest and The Forge. But that didn't begin until 2003. In the meantime I'd played a fair amount of Call of Cthulhu, D&amp;D3 and a bunch of other games with and without boards.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from gaming, I've been part of an amateur theatre group, helped organising international student festivals, read books, played computer games and shot numerous arrows at bales of straw and other immobile targets (Which among other things has thought me that the common rpg practice of searching for your arrows after a battle will be mostly futile)<br/>
<br/>
Since coming to England, I've gotten less gaming done, but I haven't given up hope that I'll get some use out of the games I did travel with.<br/>
<br/>
Update: No longer in England. I returned to Trondheim one month ago, and I'm happy to report that my gaming opportunities have exploded again.                        </div>

                            Might as well join in on the festivities.... <br/><br/>My name is Tim Boser. I am 25 and live in a small town called Cabot, Arkansas. I work full time as a store-room clerk for a transit company.  I grew up in Jacksonville, Arkansas where my father served in the Air Force at the local Air Force base, and my mother took care of me and my sister. Around the time I turned 5, my dad got transfered to Minot, North Dakota, where it can snow well into summer (which sucks as a small child, because winters could get really bad). Since we didn't go outside a lot, my friends and I turned to other hobbies to keep us occupied, namely RPGs. I know we played a couple, but the only one that stood out in my mind was Buck Rogers, but that's a different story. We moved back to Arkansas, living in Hot Springs until my dad retired from the AF, and then living in Jacksonville, and finally moving to Cabot, where I graduated from high school with honors. I attended multiple colleges, but could only barely squeak out an Associates Degree before I got tired of it. (I will return, I vow it!)  <br/><br/>Outside of gaming, I have a few hobbies: <br/>- Reading (Current titles include Max Brooks' <i>World War Z</i> and Chuck Palahniuk's <i>The Haunted</i>)<br/>- Watching Movies (Usually whatever's on IFC, plus any odd stuff I come across)<br/>- Music (I like to listen and I can play a few instruments: saxophone, piano, drums, a little guitar)<br/>- Computers (Programming, web stuff, whatever catches my interest)<br/>- Video Games (Bow to my mad Halo skillz)<br/><br/>I'm currently single, and sort of looking. I'm not all that religious, but I do think there's something more to life that I just can't define in any terms. I'm also trying to find some sort of creative avenue to take with my life, so I'm tinkering with a plethora of ideas (including writing a few games of my own) to curb my creative urges I can't satisfy elsewhere.<br/><br/>I guess that's it, I can't think of anything else to say.                        </div>

                            Hello, Iâ€™m Nicholas Freney. Iâ€™m 25 years old, and currently an undergraduate English major at the University of Nevada Las Vegas . I hope to put together an rpg.net column within the next year, and write my own story-game. The story game will be nothing fancy, but I figure it be fun to try to write one. I have been seriously involved in gaming for about two years. Before that, I only collected White Wolfâ€™s Mage the Ascension books and played the occasion game of Conspiracy X. <br/>
<br/>
 I like Hip-hop, decent comics, and anything else that catches my interest. I have several learning disabilities including Dysgraphia, which makes life as an English major interesting. I promise to do my best to be clear, but if you have trouble understanding me feel free to say something. I have no firm religious beliefs, and see people as more important then ideological beliefs.                        </div>

                            Hey all!<br/>
<br/>
I'm Shannon VanDenbos, a 31yo male, living in the great state of Minnesota in the You Ess of Ay.  I've taken crap for my name ever since I can remember.  i work at a couple of lame part-time jobs at the moment.  I'm still trying to get back into my chosen field as a computer technician/builder.<br/>
<br/>
I've been playing RPGs for 15 years or so, and my experience includes Shadowrun, D&amp;D, d20 Modern, oWoD, and nWoD.  Other hobbies include reading, movies, and posting on RPG forums.  I'm an atheist, for those who care about such things.                        </div>

                            I'm Julia, I'm 36, I live in Greenfield, MA, I'm originally from Memphis. I ended up in Western Massachusetts by way of college, where I majored in Religion. After I graduated I decided to stick around twon for a few months, but I fell in love with one of my housemates and never left. We've been together 11 years, married for 8, and have two daughters, so it was a good idea not to leave town. <br/>
<br/>
I work for pay and I hate my job, so it's not worth broadcasting. This year I'm trying to get an apprenticeship as a homebirth midwife, which is what I've always wanted to do, but didn't have the ovaries to try.  During the summer I peddle homemade herbal body products and soap at our local farmer's market.<br/>
<br/>
I've only been playing rpg's for a tad over a year, and for some godforsaken reason I decided to try to write one tentatively called "Steal Away Jordan". I think some of the lovely and kind people I play with have mentioned my work-in-progress here, and maybe someone here playtested it at JiffyCon in November. (Thanks!)<br/>
<br/>
So in my short time playing I've played PTA (a Buffy the Vampire Slayer spinoff set in Cleveland), DITV, 1001 Nights, and Sorcerer for several sessions each, and playtested a few games, too.                        </div>

                            Hi, I'm new too.<br/><br/>My real name is William Austin Schoonover (pronouned with a SK sound, not a SH) I'm 32, married, no kids (but we're considering some)<br/><br/>I'll get this out of the way first, I'm the Art Director for Steve Jackson Games.  That means I currently live in Austin, Texas.<br/><br/>I was born in St Joe, Missouri (just like Walter Cronkite) an was raised by conservative protestants in a tiny town North of Kansas City.  My mom's a gamer, but doesn't know it.  I've been playing boardgames and cardgames all my life, but didn't get a chance to even try out RPGs until the 90s.  I was, however; exposed to the entire "D&amp;D is of the devil" propaganda, not allowed to trick or treat, and couldn't watch the Smurfs or HeMan at my grandma's house because they were "EVIL!".  I still consider myself to be a Christian, but have a sorta Buddhist take on it.<br/><br/>I've done four years of "college", but don't have a degree.  When my best friend in the whole world graduated from college, I married her and we moved to St Louis.  I finally acted on my lifelong dream to be a radio DJ and went to trade school, which ended up taking me to Truth or Consequences, New Mexico where I was the morning guy on an AM country station.  TorC is a great place (if yer not a gamer) but my boss was quite possibly the craziest person I've ever personally met, so I went back to KC and got a soul sucking producer job in corporate radio.  After five years of that I jumped at the chance to work anywhere in the game industry.<br/><br/>That's probly enough history...<br/><br/>Things about me... I collect cool looking bowling balls, currently 30, but I don't bowl.  I play LazerTag about once a month, and I read all the time.<br/><br/>I haven't really gotten my feet wet yet here because I haven't been able to try any of these games out, and all my prior RPG experience is bad.  I hope to change that, and contribute a bit more to the discussion in the future.  If you want to blame anyone for my presence here, it would be Misuba and the Sons of Kryos.                        </div>

                            Seeing T or C mentioned above gave me just enough of a nudge to post on this thread, because I live in Las Cruces, NM.<br/>
<br/>
I am 58 years of age.  Graduated from high school in 1966, college in 1970.  Grew up and attended school in upstate NY.  I have lived in NY, Arizona, Maryland and NM.<br/>
<br/>
Friends introduced me to D&amp;D somewhere around 1980.  Within a few years we migrated to Dragonquest, which I still play today with an entirely different group.  Our host for gaming admits to having "a few years" on me.<br/>
<br/>
My wife and I keep two dogs and three cats.  I inspect buildings on behalf of insurance companies for a living.  Our small city is growing rapidly.  The local politicians, for the most part, eagerly court the developers.  That sucks; we can possibly delay it, but not likely stop it.  I have two dirt bikes that I never ride and several guns that I sometimes shoot.  NM is good for dirt riding and shooting.<br/>
<br/>
I haven't ever played any of the games that are usually discussed here, but keep wanting something different from our usual games.                        </div>

                            As my handle would suggest, I'm Scott Dorward.  I'm forty-one, and was born and raised in Hong Kong (with a few years out in Switzerland).  Since leaving there in my late teens, I've lived in New York, London and Dundee, before settling in Milton Keynes around sixteen years ago.  Don't believe all the bad things that people say about Milton Keynes -- some of them aren't true.<br/><br/>Like a disproportionate number of roleplayers, I work in IT.  I have one of those jobs that doesn't really fit into a neat description, but I do stuff involving servers and networks, most of it interesting, some of it involving travelling around Europe, and I get paid for it.<br/><br/>On the whole, I'm pretty boring.  I'm currently single, living alone apart from a cat, and I play a lot of games, write fiction occasionally and spend too much time watching films.  Writing this is making me wonder what the hell else I do with my time.<br/><br/>I started gaming in school, around 1983 or so, with AD&amp;D, and may have given up had I not found Traveller and then Call of Cthulhu.  These games made me fall in love with RPGs, and I played consistently through to the early nineties.  When I moved to Milton Keynes, I lost contact with all the gamers I knew in London and ended up not gaming at all for ten years.  About five years ago, a friend of mine convinced me to start running games for her and her partner, and I've been playing ever since.  <br/><br/>The explosion in indie games over the last few years has made me more excited about gaming than at any time since I was a teenager.  My patience for complex rules that simulate things that don't interest me, or for overly detailed backgrounds that make me feel constrained from making stuff up is low; focused, short games play to my strengths as a player and GM, especially as my memory isn't what it once was.<br/><br/>These days I'm a member of the Milton Keynes RPG Club, which has turned into quite a lively and diverse gaming community, where you're as likely to find a game of Dogs in the Vineyard or InSpectres as you are Dungeons &amp; Dragons or Exalted.  We hold a one-day convention every six months, called Concrete Cow (Milton Keynes is famous for a herd of concrete cows situated in a field in Blue Bridge), which is gradually building a name for itself on the UK con circuit.                        </div>

                            I'm Michael Crow<br/>
<br/>
I'm 29, and live In Hutchinson(Minneapolis), MN with my wife Kim. We were just married on 12/13 in Jamaica.<br/>
<br/>
When I'm not gaming or trying to design games, I'm a Medical Lab Tech. I hav a degree in Medical Technology, Electronics Technology, and in the past have worked as a Biomed Tech. I also worked for a time in a research lab @ the Unversity of Minnesota. Kim is an occupational therapist.<br/>
<br/>
I started gaming aroung 1990 with D&amp;D, then TMNT and other Palladium games to follow. I have been a playtester for multiple game including CCGs,Boardgames, and RPGs. Being a tinkerer, I have always been messing around with game designs of one sort or the other. The last few years I have been writing a lot of gaming reviews and in the process have come arcoss indie games. I found that there were a lot of indie games I liked, some I don't just like traditional games.<br/>
<br/>
When I'm not working or gaming I like to play Discgolf,camping, reading, watching tv (Jericho,Hero, BSG, Dresden...ect), and going to movies. I just started using Liver Journal, and like reading other peoples gaming stuff and having others read mine. I also enjoy endless and sometimes useless debates on games.<br/>
<br/>
I guess thats about it.                        </div>

                            My name is Paolo Robino. I'm 39. I currently work as R&amp;D manager in a company that produces color concentrates for plastics (aka masterbatches). When I mention my previous career, people seem baffled: in their opinion, no one sane of mind would sell his own pharmacy to become an employee in a company. They keep asking me medical advice, though. I live alone near Vicenza (Italy), have a (new, non-gaming) girlfriend, love to read non-fiction and listen to jazz and strange covers of pop music. I'm mentioned in the credits of Unknown Armies, 2nd edition, among the "Rumormongers". This fills me with pride, and shows how wrong my priorities are.                        </div>

                            Hi! I'm Chris Engle. I'll be 44 in a few months. I've been with my wife going on 20 years. We live with our present cat (Matilda Turd Cat - she bites) on an old farm outside Bloomington Indiana. Terri and I both work for Indiana University which gives us enough money to pursue our other interests - Puppetry and Game Publishing. I was born in Louisville Kentucy and raised in Southern Indiana (my family were some of the first settlers out here). I got a BA in Criminal Justice from IU and my Masters in Social Work from the University of Louisville. I spent years working in rural community mental health with a three year stint in private practice. Then I got a job at the college counseling center. I started out a nominal Anglican with Calvinist leanings but in 1986 was introduced to Sufi Islam. I converted to Sunni Islam in 1996. I'm fairly certain I have an FBI file due to that - which annoys me to no end. <br>
<br>
I started gaming in 1976 with the Avalon Hill game King Maker. The next day my borthers and I start playing D+D (the white box version). We soon fell in with a bunch of old miniatures gamers so I was indoctrinated by followers of Donald Featherstone and Jack Scruby. When I was in college in the early 80's I learned about Paddy Griffith and the experiemental games of Wargame Developments. I worked on the odd game but nothing serious until I was almost out of grad school. That is when I came up with the idea for the Matrix Game. Between 1988 and 1992 I wrote over 60 articles for various newsletters (MWAN, PW Review, Lone Warrior, and NUGGET, Shadis #6, and my own newsletter EGG). While I've always played role play games I've tended to self identify as a miniatures gamer so I've spent a lot more time in that world than in this one. That started to change when I saw that Matrix Game worked very well to do murder mysteries, spy games, political games and horror stories. Around 1998 I started building up to publish games like that. Meanwhile overseas Matrix Game are used by the British and Australian armies as planning tools.<br>
<br>
People say that gamers are not professional enough. I felt that way too so I've taken my time in getting Matrix Games ready for market. I learned how to do accounting, I've experimented with a lot of different production techniques. I've tried to build up public awareness and my network of contacts in the industry. I have a plan. If it works I hope to have 100 titles in print by 2012. It is in the realm of possibility but it will be a lot of work. Inshallah it will work.<br>

I saw Mike Underwood listed above. Hey Mike! I've also seen Robert Clark-Early and Ryan Johnson listed as well. They've been very helpful to me. Thanks for the tip on digital duplicators Ryan! Best machine I've ever bought. <br>

                            Hello.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Paul Weimer, sometimes known as Jvstin.  A couple people on this board know me. :)<br/>
<br/>
I run the long running Amber PBEM Strange Bedfellows (http://www.whiterose.org/twiki/bin/view/Bedfellows/WebHome).  I also am a regular at Ambercon US (although I missed this year)and The Black Road.<br/>
<br/>
In the last year or so, I've been slowly breaking out of a box and a rut, learning and growing with new systems and ideas. I've joined a group of "Indie Gamers" up here in the Twin Cities, and am interested in using and playing Independent Games.                        </div>

                            Jae Walker here, and I am very afraid I win "oldest", as I'm turning 53 in September. Besides my name, I go by "GamerChick", "JaeGamer" and "Countess" on the internet. I'm a recovering Catholic, occasional pagan and inquiring Buddhist still in search of my spiritual path.  Female, unwillingly single, no kids, two cats.  I live in East Lansing, Michigan, USA, in the heart of the palm, where I've always lived.  My family is dead, and I had nothing to do with it. Really.  Honest.<br/>
<br/>
I was in IT most of my adult life, until it nearly killed me.  After six years of temping and desperate job hunting, I finally secured a full time job back at the University as a secretary for a terrific boss.  Couldn't be happier, and I have health insurance.<br/>
<br/>
I remember when Chainmail first came out in 1975, but I was too busy finishing my college degree (BA in Theatre &amp; English - would you like fries with that?) to pursue it.  I finally started gaming in the early Eighties.  I've helped found a club (and am currently president-for-life-or-till-I-find-a-patsy), organized and run conventions of various sizes, taught GMing, playtested various games, co-created and ran the RPGA's Living Force campaign, got Nathan Fillion to come sit down at a Firefly game (no really, I have a photo to prove it), and know people at every level of the industry and hobby.  Yeah.  I really love gaming.  It's like that.<br/>
<br/>
In the few moments when I'm not working, sleeping or doing something gaming related, I read voraciously, collect (and watch) horror movies, SF, anime and the occasional chick flick.  Never met a vampire movie I didn't like. I'm a passionate "Firefly" fan. I have a stereotypical Irish tropism for alcohol, but it doesn't rule my life. (Why did the Good Lord create whiskey?  To keep the Irish from taking over the earth...) But mostly I'm doing something related to gaming...<br/>
<br/>
I'm a feminist* through and through, and I've made it my mission to seduce as many of my gender as possible into the gaming side of the Force.  The hobby needs more chicks.  It needs more people of color too, but as I'm all Irish, all the time, I've had less success seeking, finding and luring. I fear I lack cultural context.<br/>
<br/>
I fell in among the Indie gamers mostly by accident, but developed the addiction when I attended the GenCon workshop led by Jared Sorenson.  Dayum... they made me *think*.  I'm learning new ways to have gaming fun, and applying things I've learned to the old games too.  (I persuaded my D&amp;D GM to add Fan Mail to the game...)<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad to be here and eager to learn all I can.  And share what life has taught me, if anyone is interested.<br/>
<br/>
* Feminist = Someone who holds the radical notion that women are human beings.                        </div>

                            I'm a 27-year-old single Korean who moved to the States in 2006 to earn a J.D. degree. I also earned a B.A. in Korean law at Ewha Women's University, which is actually just a few blocks from Yonsei. *waves to fifth_child*<br/><br/>My two previous stays in the U.S. were 7 months in Tennessee as a newborn and 1 1/2 years as a child in Connecticut. The latter period is when I picked up weirdly good English, which I apparently speak without a trace of an accent. No one can figure out how I did it, least of all me. <br/><br/>Currently I'm living and studying law in D.C. Seems studying law is <i>all</i> I did since becoming a grownup. In my free time I read fantasy and history, dabble in amateur scripting (mostly PHP and mIRC), and keep a blog. And of course, I play roleplaying games. I'm especially a fanatic for Forge games.                        </div>

                            I'm a 29-year-old Irish writer-type-thing. I've been freelancing for various rpg companies since I got very, very bored with (and, mercifully, fired from) programming. For the last few years, I've been writing full-time for Mongoose Publishing on various lines (d20, Babylon 5, Conan, Paranoia etc). <br/>
<br/>
I was on the Forge back before there was a Forge, in the GamingOutpost days, but got burned out on theorising and so missed the whole indie games movement. I'm poking my nose back in now, partially as a way to kick my Warcrack habit. <br/>

                            I just turned 40, and live in Oxford, UK, with my wife and assorted small mammals. You may have come across a couple of scenarios I wrote for the Cthulhu by Gaslight supplement <i>Dark Designs</i>, a long time ago. I'm currently working on some Fudge/FATE-based rules for Lovecraftian horror gaming. I also love Jorune, Dogs in the Vineyard, Paranoia, and a bunch of other games.<br/><br/>I make a living by editing and proofreading medical research, and writing about it too. I'm currently trying to teach myself typography, layout and design to round out that skill set. My time is somewhat limited, but as Gary Sumpter will tell you, I will sometimes work for free if I find the material interesting enough. It doesn't hurt to ask, so long as a polite refusal won't offend you.<br/><br/>I also play the drums, and you can check out my band The Black Hats, at <a href="http://www.myspace.com/blackhatshome" rel="nofollow">our MySpace page</a>. We're a bit new, so no "proper" website just yet.                        </div>

                            Hello all.  I'm Matthew Sullivan-Barrett and have been lurking here for a while now.<br/>
I live in Tacoma, Washington, just south of Seattle.  I'm very much looking forward to GoPlay NW in June.<br/>
I'm a computer programmer for cash.  I game most every Saturdays, play video games most every day, and maybe every three months I'll try to pick up sketching again.<br/>
<br/>
I'm 35, and have been divorced for around 8 years.<br/>
My daughter is 12.  She's terribly bright and creative kid, and has developed great joy in really awesome manga style drawing!  She's a big sweetie, and pretty much the brightest star in my life!<br/>
My SO is also 35.  She's a Speech and Language Pathologist, and while not a gamer is very supportive of the hobby and enjoys socializing with my gaming friends outside of the game.  She also rocks.<br/>
<br/>
I was born in central Oregon, kind of out in the country.  My family's mostly educators, and my folks definitely had hippy leanings.  I got into D&amp;D there, hooked by the cartoons adverts TSR had in the back of comic books.  Mostly lonely fun, but it fired up some creative juices.<br/>
<br/>
At around age 10, my parents took on jobs teaching in a little mining town called Tembagapura in Papua (then Irian Jaya), Indonesia.  So that's where I spent my middle school years.  The town was very isolated, in the middle of the jungle high up in the mountains.  With no TV and not enough kids for most sports, it was pretty easy to get some RPG games going.<br/>
<br/>
At age 14, my folks moved to Kobe, Japan, where I attended high school.  That was pretty awesome too, but it was much more of a struggle to get some gaming on.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, at age 17 we settled down in Washington.  I've been here ever since, which makes this the longest stretch I've lived in one spot.<br/>
<br/>
My transition to Story Games went from Ars Magica to Feng Shui to Wushu, at which point I've now gone all-in with the exciting things coming out of the indie RPG communities.<br/>
<br/>
The three other guys in my gaming group are not quite as excited about always trying new stuff out, but the games we've tried have mostly been successes.  Wushu has taken over as our game of choice, with two current games using it and one more being planned.  We're halfway through our first PTA season, which is also going well.  We didn't have as much luck with Polaris, and one player melted down.  I still love Polaris deeply, though.<br/>
<br/>
I enjoy reading about design, especially in practical terms, but have not found a spark that moves me to try my hand at it yet.  I would very much like to, but don't want to force the issue.<br/>
<br/>
So, this has exceeded the length of post I'd expect anyone to read about me, by some margin.  Thanks for the indulgence.                        </div>

                            Awesome! An introductory thread!<br/><br/>My name’s Tariq Kamal, and I’m 26 years old. I’m Malay Muslim, and I live in Kuala Lumpur.<br/><br/>When I was ten years old, some neighborhood kids introduced me to a system home-brewed from Steve Jackson’s <cite>Fighting Fantasy</cite> novels. The rules were incoherent, game-play was disjointed, we had no idea what we were doing, we all outgrew the system within a year and a half, and really, the only thing I still think was cool about that whole game was that we made pretty, pretty maps.<br/><br/>Most of my friends went on to do other things, like excel academically, become doctors or lawyers, or start a rock band.<br/><br/>I stayed obsessed with gaming. It’s been an interesting ride — I never had an easy time trying to find a gaming group, so in the end, I decided to make my own <del>from hapless bystanders</del> with my non-gaming friends. Oh, and my wife, who treats my obsession with a combination of slight exasperation, amusement, confusion and (especially after getting <cite>Truth and Justice</cite>) enthusiasm.<br/><br/>At any rate, that’s all there is to it. Apart from that home-brew system, I’ve had a bit of playing experience with the following: <acronym title="old world of darkness">oWOD</acronym> <cite>Mage</cite>, <cite>D&amp;D</cite> 3.5, <cite>Star Wars</cite> d20 and <cite>Truth &amp; Justice</cite>.                        </div>

                            I'm Joe: 40, GWM, work as a statistician/programmer in pharmaceutical R&amp;D, grew up in Chicago and now live there again with my partner of 6 years, Nick.  I used to play D&amp;D back in high school and college, tried out some other systems like Champions and GURPS, then got into the WoD.  Most of my experience with the latter was through on-line play at GarouMUSH.  I stopped playing games when I got my "real job".  Over the last few years, I've started playing boardgames again, mostly thanks to my partner's brother-in-law, who's a big, big fan of games like Settlers of Catan, Puerto Rico, etc.  <br/><br/>In recent years I've been reconnecting with some of my old gaming buddies from college, and we've been trying to get back into RPGs.  We're working on an Ars Magica saga, and I plan on introducing them to SGs as soon as I get them figured out myself!  The biggest limitation is time: work takes up a chunk, family another, non-gaming friends another, and my partner is just not into RPGs.  Yet.  I still have hope!  If only I hadn't subjected him to an evening of D&amp;D last year...<br/><br/>Other pastimes: reading (duh), knitting, cooking, baking.                        </div>

                            My name is not really Lachek Vojiczek Butalek, but that name (handle, actually) is original and means something, whereas my real name is similar to "John Smith" in Swedish.<br/>
<br/>
I'm 30, well 29, well just about 30 I guess (grumble). I maintain PCs for the Faculty of Humanities at our local university, which has taught me that Humanities faculty are among the most and the least knowledgeable people in the world. The phrase "angels dancing on pinheads" has been used. So has simply "pinheads".<br/>
<br/>
I lived the first 2/3rds of my life in Sweden. I started reading Lone Wolf Choose-Your-Own-Adventure books when I was 10, which naturally led to roleplaying as soon as I could figure out the rules. When I was 16, I joined a group of likeminded and eventually our gaming group grew to a dozen people - despite the fact that we lived on an island of only 14000, an old conservative farming and fishing community. Now I live in a half-a-million large North American city and can barely find enough people for a biweekly game. Shame.<br/>
<br/>
In the late 90s, MUSHes rather than MUDs forever shaped the way I would approach roleplaying - probably the sole reason I haven't joined in the mindless wailing of the choir of undead World of Warcraft players. MUSHes taught me to emphasize story over character achievement, and that the real killer of fun isn't having your character fail, it's not getting a chance to play at all. It's also where I met the woman that was to bring me "across the pond". I moved to Canada to marry this wonderful woman, and now have two kids - an 11-year old moody pre-teen emo stepson (and fellow gamer) and a 2 year old son who likes to smash windows, climb bookcases, and endlessly bring me my copy of Burning Empires (ooh, pretty colours!).<br/>
<br/>
I found indie/story/Forgeish games through podcasting (thanks Paul, Judd, Ryan, Chris, Jason, Remi, Clinton etc), which has greatly increased my interest in gaming and game design in recent years. To me, these games fill a space that other games never quite managed to fill, and fit very well with my current lifestyle and schedule.<br/>
<br/>
When I don't work, game or hang out with my family, I usually think about work, games or hanging out with my family. When I don't do that, I sometimes pretend to read an actual book made of paper, watch movies, make stuff from old Linux-powered PCs, manage my website (http://www.hammergames.org), post on message boards such as this fine example right here, and sometimes even have time to work on my game(s) - usually late night / early morning, when everyone is sleeping and with only the coffee pot as witness.                        </div>

Wa'alaikum Salam! What, experiences as a gamer or as a Muslim? ;-)<br/><br/>Seriously, I don't remember anything gaming-related that seems unusual right now. Well, there was that one time where I was playing a Batini in a <acronym title="old World of Darkness">oWOD</acronym> Mage game in the Digital Web, but the less we talk about that the better.                        </div>

                            My name's Jonathan Lambeth and I'm about to turn 30.  I live in the area of Southern California known as "the 909" with my three kids and beautiful wife.  I work as a Mechanical Engineer for Boeing, but my degree is in Physics.  I started gaming in junior high with whatever version of DnD was around back then, but I didn't seriously begin until college.  My love of Star Wars snagged me into playing the old d6 system.  After my gaming group broke up I discovered the first iteration of the Forge (I think it was called the Hephaestus Forge at the time), and have been lurking around ever since with the occasional post.  For at least the last six years I have desperately wanted to play any one of the awesome indie games I have read so much about.  Maybe I should move to North Carolina or Portland!                        </div>

                            I'm Steve Barker, 31, British and I fiddle with all manner of game design projects.  I don't work at the moment due to a chronic health problem which also doesn't leave me much energy for game design but I do what I can.<br/><br/>I haven't done any role playing at all in about 7 years due to the usual work and relocation factors, as well as the afore-mentioned health problem which has ruled the last 5 years of my life.  Still, I find myself being drawn back into the role playing arena by the innovation I'm seeing in these here new-fangled story games, and the overlaps I'm seeing in some of their mechanics with the board games I am more usually playing (I can occasionally be seen at <a href="http://www.bgdf.com/" rel="nofollow">the <i>Board Game Designers Forum</i></a> as well).<br/><br/>Outside of gaming there isn't much to see of me, except I help with some of the behind-the-scenes work at my friend <a href="http://www.arcanumvisual.com/" rel="nofollow">Lisa Jonté</a>'s female artists collective <a href="http://www.never-done.com/" rel="nofollow"><i>Women's Work</i></a>, and am an occasional sidekick on <a href="http://www.webcomicsnation.com/divalea/divaleashow/series.php" rel="nofollow"><i>The Divalea Show</i></a> podcast, hosted by comics artist and commentator <a href="http://divalea.livejournal.com/" rel="nofollow">Lea Hernandez</a> (that podcast is on hiatus, by the way, while Lea and family recover from a devastating house fire last year).                        </div>

                            Why would I want to introduce myself?  Jimminy Crickets compared too many on this list Iâ€™m an under educated buffoon.    <br/>
<br/>
Letâ€™s see, Iâ€™m 33, not married, have no children and have about 40 college credits.  I live in Omaha Nebraska and I am a photographer.  I have my own web site which I finally got set up a week ago, www.AndrewKolbPhotography.com .  I donâ€™t even have my new business cards printed yet.  So I guess you could say I am 2/3 self-unemployed.  Hehe. Thatâ€™s my joke for today.<br/>
<br/>
I have been gamer since age 8, so about 25 years.  I canâ€™t tell you the number of RPGs Iâ€™ve played; probably 40+.  Itâ€™s like an illness.  I was giddy with joy when I got Bug Hunters and completed my collection of Amazing Engine books a couple weeks ago, and right now there is a package on its way from Canada with the expansion book for The Price of Freedom.  Did you even know there was an expansion book for The Price of Freedom?    I didnâ€™t until this very morning!<br/>
<br/>
I consider myself a game designer although none of mine, except one, are ready to play test and that one never will be; itâ€™s tainted with personal failings that really have nothing to do with the game itself.    My games probably are not true â€œStory Gamesâ€™ although they are of the â€˜rules lightâ€™ variety.<br/>

Thatâ€™s about it<br/>

                            I'm Joe Porrett, 38, single.  I work as an office monkey for law firm in East Lansing, Michigan.  I've been know to strum an acoustic guitar for time to time.  My current obsessions include Guitar Hero (1, 2, 80's), Flight of the Conchords and Sim City DS.  <br/>
<br/>
I've been a gamer since 1982, cutting my teeth on the old red box D&amp;D.  I've played numerous games over the years.  These day I play mostly what would be termed "indie games,"  but I have a soft spot for NightLife and Talislanta.<br/>
<br/>
The most recent rpgs I've played: <br/>
<br/>
Breaking the Ice - Played a few weeks ago with my friend Ed.  BtI never disappoints.  I've played it twice and they are two of the most memorable games I've ever played.<br/>
<br/>
Nine Worlds -  I ran 9W for about 6 months until GM burn-out kicked in.  I hope to return to it because it is an amazing game.  It's cool though; it gave one of the other guys in my group a chance to run a game, a Psychic game that uses psuedo- Dogs in the Vineyard rules.<br/>
<br/>
I'm gearing up to run InSpectres for the first time.<br/>

I'm a game programmer working at Activision; formerly employed by Take-Two, Electronic Arts, and Microprose. My specialties are gameplay programming, AI, general software architecture, and tools development.<br/>
<br/>
My gaming life started with the Magnavox Odyssey, Feudal, and Basic D&amp;D. Through the 80s, 90s, early 00s I played D&amp;D, a smattering other RPGs, various war and board games, 40K, a couple of CCGs, and a great number of computer games.<br/>
<br/>
I decided to go GenCon Indy for the first time in 2005. Uninterested in playing board games, minis, traditional RPGs, CCGs, and wondering what I was doing at GenCon, I stumbled across a booth selling something called indie roleplaying games. It provided a "Eureka!" moment, as I've always wanted more storytelling in my gaming and I studied improv acting for a few years and decided I was more interested in gaming.<br/>
<br/>
Most recently played: Spirit of the Century. Other hobbies include <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.hanare.org/zmm_200608/5%20Intermediate%20Students/slides/DSCN1033.html" rel="nofollow">kyudo</a>. Most of my interest in game design has been in computer and video game design, particularly strategy game design and the grand dream of interactive storytelling. As I gain more experience with PnP roleplaying as a player and GM, I am thinking more about RPG design and designing "my" game.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to be at GenCon next week. I can't wait to check out (and support) the Ashcan Front, the Play Collective, and all the new seeds of the indie games explosion.                        </div>

                            Greetings, Story Gamers.<br><br>I'm Rich DiTullio.  I am 33 years old, married to Amber a lovely gamer chick, and have an 18 month old son named Teddy.  To pay the bills, I put my PhD in Molecular Biology to work fighting a disease of the lung using a mouse model.  Started with D&amp;D 23 years ago coloring in my dice with crayon, drifted through White Wolf and Palladium with brief side trips for Tales From the Floating Vagabond, and now I stare hungrily at the various story games wishing I had a local group who loved them too.  I did have a Burning Wheel group for a bit, Gm'd by Jake Norwood of Riddle of Steel fame no less, but alas that is no more.  I'm currently running a BW one on one game with my wife that is going fairly well.  Oh, any in Burning Wheel circles would know me as Verrain.                        </br></br></div>

I'm 33 and a computer programmer specializing in military technologies. I've done several displays for jets and choppers, and am currently working on the training software for a missile launcher. I only wish the jobs would be as cool as they sound.<br/>

                            Hi, my name is Matt Weber (oh noes!  another Matt W!), and this is my first post on SG.  I guess I'm coming a bit late to this party, but I hope not too late.<br>
<br>
I met (and gamed with) Moderator Andy at GenCon recently, and know or have met several other SG people in real life.  In fact, I went to college with and used to live with Ben Lehman, who got me into Indie RPGs a few years ago.  (Thanks Ben!)  Before that, I played mostly traditional-but-not-D&amp;D-games, like EarthDawn, and also a number of homebrew games written by people in the Brown college gaming crowd.  That group is still a big part of my life emotionally and socially, and I go back up to New England for a boffer LARP called Aralis run by a Brown alum, but nowadays I reside in New York City.<br>
<br>
Favorite games today include Riddle of Steel and Burning Wheel, but I've enjoyed almost all the indie games I've played, which is a fairly long list at this point.  I'm radically anti-rules-fudging and anti-GM-Fiat.<br>
<br>
Outside of gaming:  I am 25, white, an atheist Jew, and I have relatively minor orthapedic physical disabilities.  I was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 1981.  Before transferring to Brown, I attended Simon's Rock College in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, for two years.  (There's at least one other SGer who went to Simon's Rock...)  My majors in college were math and French Lit., and I recently finished a Master's program in Math Education.  I worked for a year as math teacher in the Bronx, and am currently looking for another teaching job as of this posting, though hopefully I will have one within a few days.<br>
<br>
Although I enjoy reading sci-fi and fantasy, as well as movies and TV shows, as much as the next geek, my major hobby outside of gaming is music.  I sing, compose, and play piano (poorly :-) ).  I'm seriously considering trying to return to graduate school to pursue an M.A. in composition if the high school teaching thing doesn't work out.  But I like the idea of being a high school teacher, because (especially in private schools) I will be more likely to have the opportunity to do things other than just teach math.  I might get to use my French skills, or my musical knowledge, although of course my secret dream is to start an RPG club.<br>
<br>
Anything else you want to know, just ask.  I hope to jump in on some regular threads here within the next day or so.<br/>
<br/>

                            My name is Matt Schlotte, if that weren't obvious. I currently live in Portland, Oregon with my wonderful wife and two daughters. I was born in San Diego, lived too long in Oklahoma, changed my perception of reality multiple times and the way I live my life three times in Massachusetts before moving to Oregon, wherein I eventually got married to above wonderful wife and she bore our two exciting daughters.<br/><br/>I am only now wrapping up my Bachelors degree in History with a smidge of Econ, due to at the traditional college age I was doing the college parties and knew any academic career would have been a sham at the time. There is a Masters degree in the future but that is next year.<br/><br/>I too was an active Jew at one time in my life but that has not been the case for a long time. There are many other things I used to do such as playing bass, writing music, sky diving, rock climbing, smoke, read different spiritual texts, work at jobs I hated, live in a tent, hitch-hike across the country and more. Now I spend time with my wife and kids and have a blast at that, while focusing more on a few interests that have remained with me since my early days, namely history texts, anime, comics/manga,  and the very occassional video game or miniature table top gaming (not mentioning RPGs since that isn't what this thread is about). The past times are enjoyed pretty closely in that order.                        </div>

                            I'm James Drake Hargrove, a 30-year-old part-time computer hardware technician, full-time mortgage application screener, and recovering drug addict. I was selected to participate in my Grammar School's Gifted Education program (where I first played D&amp;D -- for a grade, no less). In Junior High, I was a participant in Duke University's Talent Search program, outscoring 90% of the nation's High School seniors in language comprehension and logical problem solving. In High School I became a budding substance abuser and was eventually ejected during my Junior year. I complete my required curriculum and received my Diploma via an alternative education center for troubled youth -- a month before my High School class graduated. <br/><br/>After High School I went on to become a full-fledged drug addict, spending some time in the county clink, and running with full-fledged felons (from former motorcycle gang members to full-on drug manufacturers). Life was pretty much a miserable series of petty crime (and some not-so-petty-crimes) until 1997 when I cleaned up, moved to Topeka, KS and worked a series of security jobs until my relapse in 2001 and my subsequent move to California in 2002. In California, I cleaned up again and worked under contract for the Department of Defense via Day &amp; Zimmerman Servies until 2003 when DZS lost their China Lake contract. Another relapse and multiple moves across the country followed as my physical health and mental welfare deteriorated drastically. <br/><br/>Somewhere along the way, Politically Incorrect Games published Formless as a free product (per my stipulation that it remain forever free). Other than that, the exact details are pretty foggy due to excessive drinking binges at Fort Lewis and subsquent physical deterioration. When I left the area, I was suffering from alcohol-induced jaundice and swelling of the liver, which wasn't diagnosed until. . . <br/><br/>I moved to Colorado Springs in November of 2004 and cleaned up again. <br/><br/>Since that time I lost my (admittedly crappy) car, burned through a small number of menial jobs which paid next to nothing (and sometimes nothing), and ate many meals at the local soup kitchen for lack of finances to buy my own food. Last year, a good friend and general contractor hired me part-time to work as a general laborer. Early this year I managed to land a job with a local mortgage lead generation company. Since then, I've managed to survive multiple lay-offs and generate enough money to pay some of my bills on time, feed myself again (Ramen, baby!), and cover the necessities of living with a tiny bit left over for the occassional RPG purchase (fun <i>is</i> a necessity). <br/><br/>I've done some volunteer work at the aforementioned soup kitchen and some other local charities this year. I donate to organizations that helped me avoid a tremendously painful death when I can afford to do so. Emotionally, I'm 100% better than I was three years ago. Physically, I have to live with a lot of my past decisions but am not much worse for wear. Mentally, I'm probably more stable than most Earth People whom I know. Spiritually, I've learned a lot about honesty, open-mindedness, and willingness. I'm "cash register" honest today (i.e., if somebody gives me too much change, I give it back).<br/><br/>Mostly,  I'm extremely greatful that I'm here and able to post this response today. Thank you to all of you who helped me find the will to live. Some of you know who you are, some of you don't, but you will <i>all</i> be in my heart for as long as I'm kicking around on this big, blue, marble. Today, I'm making an effort to do for others what you did for me, so that others can experience your good will and, hopefully, pass it on to somebody else.<br/><br/>Who am I? I'm the best person I can be.                        </div>

                            Greetings,<br/><br/>I've been lurking on this particular site for a good six months now. I don't post often, but I love to read what is going on. I got into the whole story games thing when I read about <i>Don't Rest Your Head</i> on rpg.net.<br/><br/>Personally? I'm a laboratory analyst and do work in both bioanalytical research and FT-IR spectroscopy analysis for QC at 3M. I live in Minnesota and other non-RPG hobbies include the requisite board gaming (Euro games especially) and animal care. I love caudates, the salamanders and newts, and other amphibians and take great joy in caring for them and potentially photographing them in the wild. Most other animals are awesome too, though I'm partial to cockatiels and dogs (especially mutts) when it comes to my non-semi-permeable skinned companion animals. <br/><br/>Never worked on an RPG, just like to play them. I don't think I have the skills and mind for producing one of my own. I can't even modify the ones I have very well. <br/><br/>It's great to post on this site, it has such an awesome community!                        </div>

                            So who am i, who knows, but i can point to some facts anyway... IÂ´ll order this as a series of "nested flashbacks", and perhaps youÂ´ll get a picture...<br/><br/>IÂ´ve been lurking around for a few weeks here at S-G, and this would only be my second post. The reason is the fact that i see a lot of deep thoughts circling around, even in the form of jokes; youÂ´ve got to have something good to say when matched against that background... So in those weeks iÂ´ve followed Graham W. lose faith and being brought back to "teh awesome"Â´s faith, picked a lot of thoughts about games that now i "get" better, watched Gen Con from a thousand miles ( in a mix of awe and dismay, due to the comparison of the size of the gamer community here and there ), perceived how accesible, real, discussable are the names of the designers of some great games; and on and on of interesting stuff. <br/>( Byproduct: Load of cash just about to be sent to IPR in exchange of a big piece of the indie cake ).<br/><br/>I got here mostly following the diaspora around, and specially after I ventured into the Game Chef for my first ever (in)complete take at making a RPG. The logic is "That was cool, i needed more of that, i come here". Great kudos there to Mr. Dogui, in both cases an important part of the fact of "entering".<br/><br/>Re: Forge, indieness, and RPG theory, i always saw something more than fun in RPGs. Fun is a great thing, but there had to be something else that was ticking me this hard. IÂ´ve made my attempts at explaining or debating this hobby of us and never found much feedback; so when someone in our boards mentioned a pdf called "Design patterns in roleplaying" or something like that, i read it and followed the breadcrumbs to The Forge. <br/>I digested that all, and still do, even bringing up topics from years before; got into CostisickÂ´s blogging, into Ben LehmanÂ´s "this is my blog" series of explanations of theory, and all that jazz. And i liked it too...<br/><br/>"Our forums" there means "www.deRol.com.ar", and that ".ar" means i hail from the lovely Buenos Aires city, and that this is not only an attempt to convey some meanings but also a practice in writing them into a foreign language ( Hola amigos ). The community down here is interesting, thriving, but mostly small, endogamic, and dulled out in endless d20 and bitching to each other. Roleplaying games are much newer to us as a whole, the boom for them being in the nineties ( with comics, ccgs, and all other forms of geek consumerism; something directly tied to the peso to dollar ratio of those days now gone ); and the "old guard" of enthusiasts has already phased out and replaced by a more stablished, but less proactive bunch. ( All this is MY opinion, of course ). In that context, indie-, story-, or whatever-games have a hard time reaching out; as the ones who would run them are few and spread... But that may change, albeit slowly.<br/><br/>Add me in the picture: See 1995, see a nerdish kid last year of elementary school; a kid with a lot of comic/cartoon stories in his head and interested in reading and learning about those "comics" things. The teacher of the kid having made a "class library" of voluntarily lent books and comics; and among them The Killing Joke. Yes, Alan Moore, Brian Bolland; Batman, the Joker origin; gritty, thoughtful... When i finished it, i had to search a few hours for the pieces of my brains spread through the room; moments later i wanted more... And ended up with many numbers of a geekish magazine about comics and related items, and among those related were RPGs, a little explained. When the year later a mini mini con was held at my high school, i was teleported into the head of an X wing pilot and got completely hooked up to this thing to this day... From there, you can picture using the booming "internet thing" to find forums to discuss about it, and after failing converting my friends into gamers, and not finding other gamer places yet, a long history of PBP Star Wars d6, only truncated by the 9/11-induced change of atmosphere in those forums ( i remember a guy posting "I wish we turn their deserts into glass" ) and some of that annoying "real life" thing...<br/><br/>The reason to name my teacher is that now iÂ´m following her path and becoming a school teacher; and that as a queue to tell you that last year i adventured into Brazil to be the first non-Brazilian to attend the IVth Simposium of RPGs and Education: something that interests me a lot. IÂ´m surprised of the non-connection of this two communities made-of-awesome, brazilian RPG theorists and education researchers and indie/story/-gamers; and i hope i become such bridge in the future: i believe shooting sacred design cows could make a hell of a change in the way games are considered in light of their educational value... But more about that on different posts, i suppose.<br/><br/>Anyway, thatÂ´s quite a bunch of facts about me... Thanks for the welcome, then...                        </div>

                            I'm Rob, 44 year old white ango-saxon male, born and living in Toronto, Canada.  Youngest of 4 children of generally happy family complete with yard, dog and cat.  Now a condo dweller with no kids, no yard, no dog and no cat.<br/><br/>Poli-Economics degree and thereafter a job in the civil service I had for 6 years before I realized "criminy, I'm following my dad's footsteps" (talk about a blind spot).  I'm a policy analyst developing and revising laws for consumer protection and public safety and trying not to turn into an embittered cynic after 20 years in public service.<br/><br/>Used to computer game quite a bit but dropped it as absorbing too much time.  Have always read tons ~ my older sister had copies of Lord of the Rings, you can blame her and a household where most rooms had bookshelves and everyone read.  Being an adult means (a) reading; (b) playing cards; (c) debating politics.  Try to read different sorts of non-fiction as well.   Cards became RPG's, and my job means I can't debate most of the politics I know about publicly.<br/><br/>Got into RPG gaming via miniatures I was getting for wargaming with my dad (who never "got" RPGing, but also never had any concerns about it, when you're the 4th kid and the first 3 have turned out okay, parents tend to be a bit laid back).  Been gaming since high school and some events put on for gamers at the Toronto harbourfront area, and running a D&amp;D game for some friends since 1986 through every edition of it.  So every Thursday night I get to tell 5 people "here's the law", and about once every 5 years I get to tell 13 million or so "here's the law" (though the 5 have to take me more seriously than the 13 million).  That also means I'm a world designer who probably knows way too much about the ecomonic and judicial systems of every culture.  Also game less frequently with others trying out different systems (e.g., Universalis, Ryan S.'s E6 variant of D&amp;D).<br/><br/>Athiest, red tory politically, not married but thoroughly attached to a grade school teacher who tolerates my hobby in exhange for me tolerating her infatuation with Winnie the Pooh.  Cat person but allergic to them.                        </div>

                            I'm Ben, 32 year old white male living in Newcastle in the north east of England. I work for a bank to pay the bills, I've been living with my girlfriend for the last five years and we have no children or pets. I come from a family of staunch atheists and I'm extremely liberal in my political outlook. Grew up under Thatcher and would rather vote Satan than Tory.<br/><br/>I train regularly in submission wrestling and mma and I enjoy watching may sports, I watch very little TV that isn't sports. <br/><br/>I read a lot, I've Spook Country, The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay, and Crooked Little Vein lined up next. I read a lot of comics, like most of us on this side of the pond, I got into it reading 2000AD and was at the right age to follow all the main writers over to America pre-Vertigo. It wouldn't be too much of an exagerration to say that reading Doom Patrol changed my life. <br/><br/>I know pro-wrestling.<br/><br/>I like listening to electronic music and have long since lost track of what the kids are listening to.<br/><br/>Began gaming aged 9 with a copy of the Fighting Fantasy gamebook, Island of the Lizard King. Moved onto tabletop rpg-ing the following year with AD&amp;D and roleplayed religiously throughout the remainder of my school days, mainly MERP, Cyberpunk, Paranoia, Rifts, Heroes Unlimited and Marvel. Came back to the hobby in my early twenties and played a lot of WoD. Came back again early this year to play a bunch of indie games.<br/><br/>Currently spending most of my spare time writing comic books and an rpg.                        </div>

                            I'm Jason Ellis, born 1973, living in Queens.  Had kind of a hippy upbringing in rural southern maryland, came to NYU in '91 to become an actor.  Acting ended up on the back burner after I was distracted by running around in a band, enjoying some great roleplaying campaigns (thanks Lukzu) and trying to get rent money going.<br/><br/>Hooked up with a lot of new roleplaying friends thanks to nerd.NYC in 2001 or so.  Met Jenskot then, in line for Wrestlemania 20, and over the years he filled my head with stories of all the fun people he knows and the indie game movement in general. Spent some quality time internet arguing with Thor Olavsrud and others about game theory at nerd.nyc a few years back, and learned a good peck of neat forge ideas from them in the process.<br/><br/>I know a whole lot about comics, computer games and professional wrestling, a good deal about theater, art, and music, a passable amount about computers, primatology, and brain science, a little bit about roleplaying games, but almost nothing about knowing when to shut up.<br/><br/>I like to perform and I like to ask questions.  I love game strategy.  I love cooperation, I love people, and I love kicking people's butts.  Its rare that I meet someone I don't like, although it happens.<br/><br/>More than anything else, I usually define myself as a music making guy.   You can find examples <a href="http://www.myspace.com/worldofjasoncraft" rel="nofollow">Here</a>, <a href="http://www.worldofjasoncraft.com" rel="nofollow">Here</a>, and <a href="http://www.worldofjasoncraft.com/harryheretic/harryheretic.html" rel="nofollow">Here</a>.

                            I'm 34. I write for and design games for a living. I also do freelance IP development outside of RPGs. Before writing full time I worked part time as a literacy instructor, computer skills teacher and tech support guy, mostly in the nonprofit sector. I'm married, with two kids, acquired by marriage. I have a degree in Cultural Studies/Philosophy (I concentrated on both analytical and continental approaches to morality and identity) from the same Uni as Mo Turkington, who I used to LARP with about a decade and a bit ago. I was originally recruited by White Wolf to do some work on Mage. Now, over 20 books and God knows how many IPs/lines later, things are going petty well.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike many gamers I am not a big minis/board/CCG guy, though I do play on occasion. I like old school Battletech quite a bit.<br/>
<br/>
I did a lot of political activism when I was younger (and still am, but parenting and work have changed what I do). As a result of one related incident I had plastic surgery to fix the damage done by a murder attempt in 1993. If you met me, you wouldn't be able to tell. Like 50% of nerds martial arts is one of my hobbies. I have a junior teaching license in Okinawan-derived kempo and have dabbled in a bunch of other things. Right now I crosstrain informally with a taekwondo club and do kung fu. I want to get more submission grappling experience, but it's petty damned expensive around these parts.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from gaming, martial arts and being a father and husband I like the same crap as everybody else.<br/>
<br/>
I'm a lapsed Buddhist (Thich Nhat Hanh's liturgy), but that has nothing to do with my hobbies. My father and his father were also Buddhists and I picked it up from there.<br/>
<br/>
If you're reading this there's a strong chance you already know my opinions on a number of things.                        </div>

                            Hi<br>
<br>
I'm a daddy RPG player and DM from Cerdanyola del VallÃ©s, behind Barcelona at Catalunya (eastern Spain) where I live with two ladies (http://flickr.com/photos/lobisome/863234990/) and two kitten (http://flickr.com/photos/lobisome/119745573/in/set-72057594097696685/).<br>
<br>
Just guess which one I'm married with O:-)<br>
<br>
But I digress...<br>
<br>
I'm almost 37 and I started roleplaying almost quite 20 years ago and I even founded a quite big and active RPG association named "Els Bergants a Syl GarÃ´th". My RPG evolution started with Middle Earth RolePlaying to GURPS passing through Ars Magica, Cthulhu's Call, White Wolf's "Fantastic Five" (you know: Vampire, Werewolf and such). With GURPS I decided to stop learning new systems, but my head got collapsed and I never played a GURPS game but got a VERY interesting collection of GURPS supplements.<br>
<br>
But these days are long past and today I'm a daddy player wannabe (AKA no-time-to-spend-a-whole-day-RPGing) whose last RPG hope is PBEM and Indie Games. As I've seen some kinda indie examples on spanish RPG market, this vitality about systems, market and community around these Indie Games is a new world for me.<br/>
<br/>
I'm preparing a fantasy-victorian Story Bones (http://www.pigames.net/collaborative/index.php?action=read&amp;page=293) PBEM game using Quest (http://www.foreverpeoplerpg.com/Cheap_Seats_Quest.txt) email-formatting-rules (but merging email with wiki as I told here: http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=916&amp;page=2#Item_13) but there are a couple of games that will be my first choice as soon I got the opportunity to play a table-top RPG session again:<br/>
- Dogs in the Vineyard<br/>
- Burning Wheel<br/>
<br/>
Regards from Catalonia<br/>
Juan Vicente MaÃ±anas Abad.<br/>
<br/>
PS: I'd also add that, once I read this stuff about GNS model I realize that I started as a simulationist (GMing MERP and such) but today I feel more as a narrativist as, maybe due to my lack of spare time, I REALLY prefer the shared story part from RPG over all.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Hi.  I'm Kevin, I'm almost 30, I live just outside Boston, MA, and I'll be married in about two weeks.<br/><br/>I grew up in and around Buffalo, NY, and got my BA in English from the University of Rochester.  I spent about a year working as a paperwork designer for a biotech company in Cambridge, MA before going to BC Law School.  I'm currently a commercial litigator working at a mid-sized firm in Worcester.  My most interesting job was the summer I spent as a law clerk in the Prosecutor's Office at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.<br/><br/>I did a bit of theater in college and law school, would love to get back into it, but never have the time. <br/><br/>My older brother played D&amp;D while he was in high school, so that got me interested.  In junior high I cut my teeth on Red Box basic D&amp;D, gradually moving up to 1E AD&amp;D.  Played a bunch of AD&amp;D, Shadowrun and D6 Star Wars in high school, and ran an intermittent Marvel Superheroes RPG campaign.<br/><br/>I played a bunch of stuff in college, including V:tM LARP, AD&amp;D, GURPS, and Heroes Unlimited.  Once I left college, it's been difficult to find the time to play anything.  I've played a little bit of D&amp;D 3E and Champions, but that's about it.<br/><br/>Poking around online, I found the Forge, which introduced me to Burning Wheel and the like.  Since then, I've become interested in porting more "story-oriented" techniques (like flags, conflict res, etc.) into more "traditional" RPGs, whatever the heck that means.                        </div>

                            I am a 41 year-old columnist and writer from Clearwater Florida.<br/><br/>My column "Close to the Edit" just resumed after a year-long hiatus on RPG.net. I write primarily for myself, but occasionally other people find it interesting. I have been most "known" by my association with Cyberpunk 2020 and Action! System. I am also the official body model for Fat Messiah Games and the official jackass of the story-games forum.<br/><br/>I have been divorced three times, have two children, and also one grandson.<br/><br/>My first game was a copy of the blue D&amp;D intro box in 1977, my second was the original edition of Traveller in that same year. I have played games as diverse as Arduin and as eclectic as Sorcerer. I am also ostensibly writing my own SF game, called Heisenberg.<br/><br/>I find myself a bit awed by how far the hobby has evolved, and the speed at which it continues to evolve, most especially here. I think they keep me around only out of morbid curiousity.                        </div>

That and many other things.<br/><br/>I've worked as a journalist, a photographer's assistant and sound engineer predominantly. I co-founded a (very) small multimedia company and acted as director there. I've had digestive problems since 1984 but starting in 1998, I became <i>very </i>sick with an undiagnosed, severe illness. I lost everything in the process. <br/><br/>A couple of years ago I finally learned I have celiac disease. I am feeling better now and starting to get back on my feet. I'm currently self-employed, doing the odd mercenary job for old acquaintances in the music business.<br/><br/><b>My interests</b><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Arts</span>. Pretty things, entertainment, low-brow, high-brow. I've learned that you can only go so far inllectualizing everything so I'm trying to keep it more simple. Before 1998, I used to sing in blues, 70s prog and metal bands. I'm trying to see if I can pick up again, despite my age. I've lost a lot of range.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">People</span>. Before I got sick, I might have put arts before people but not anymore. I try to be nice. I hate people who are deliberately mean. Not unpleasant folks or folks who are hard to deal with but "calculated meanness". I have character flaws but I mean well, always. I can pull your leg, though. I don't take things too seriously, especially not roleplaying games.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cats</span>. Especially my own. I find I can relate to cats in some strange way. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Roleplaying</span>. I have been roleplaying since I was 9, started with the "Orange Box" (French version of Basic D&amp;D). Me and my friend had to learn to roleplay by ourselves and we introduced lots of people to it. It's kind of cool knowing you created a whole branch of roleplayers like that. As far as theory and things like that... I'm interested in the basics but I'm not "aligned" with any particular philosophy. I designed/homebrewed a lot of games in French, especially pre-2000. Quite a few were amusing in retrospective. These days I mostly use a Story Engine hack, D&amp;D 3.5 and my beloved Everway.                        </div>

                            I'm Peter Aronson (no surprise there!), I'm 50, and live in Phoenix, Arizona, but am originally from Massachusetts.  I have a BS in Computer and Information Science from UMass Amherst, and an MA in Geography from SUNY Buffalo.  I work as a Software Designer and Programmer for ESRI, creating Geographic Information Systems Software, which means I'm actually doing what I went to school to do -- how weird is that?  I like my job -- it provides lots of interesting problems to solve.  I occasionally write science fiction, and fantasy and have a shoebox full of rejection slips around somewhere from trying to get it published.<br/><br/>I'm been happily married to Casceil, who is a Staff Attorney for the Arizona Supreme Court, for 18 years.  We met at a science fiction convention.  She doesn't game except for an occasional board or card game, but she does encourage my gaming (after all, it could've been golf!).  We still go to science fiction conventions together.<br/><br/>I have two scary-smart teenage kids -- Jenny and Alex -- both of whom game, and were in fact responsible for me getting back into RPGs after 10+ gap, when they encountered demos of the Wildside Gaming System*, and got interested.  (*Which we quickly discarded in favor of about anything else!)  They've also gotten me interested in Anime and Manga, and I give them books from my science-fiction collection.  We also have a couple of cats we rescued from a shopping center parking lot, who then took over the house.<br/><br/>I got involved in war gaming (Tractics, Sea Power, Avalon Hill, SPI board games and the like) in junior high school, and ended up hanging around the MIT Strategic Games Society (which always had more members who were not MIT students than were).  Then, in 1973 or 1974, Kevin Slimak came back from a convention at Lake Geneva with a playtest copy of the original D&amp;D.  Many games resulted.<br/><br/>I soon started a correspondence with Gary Gygax, which led to a couple of articles being published in The Strategic Review and The Dragon.  Later, I contributed occasionally to The Wild Hunt (A&amp;E's, younger, East Coast sibling, which was sort of run out of the MITSGS, since that was where Mark Swanson and Glenn Blacow ran their games).<br/><br/>I mostly ran and played D&amp;D in the MITSGS-style, which was based on the original 3 books of D&amp;D plus Greyhawk (the supplement, not the setting), and featured alternate magic systems, critical hits, and very tactical rules.  However, we tried Runequest, Empire of the Petal Throne, Metamorphous Alpha, Villains &amp; Vigilantes, Traveler, etc.<br/><br/>I fell out of gaming when I married and moved to Phoenix, but as I mentioned, got back in when my kids got interested.  These days I play a bit of D&amp;D 3.5e, a bit more of True20, and play around with other systems (lately it's been FATE/SotC, Sorcerer and OVA, but that can change without notice).  I like the forums here as they have an interesting blend of theory and practice (even if a background in a social science has made me a bit skeptical of theory) and are usually reasonably polite.  <br/><br/>I post on a number of forums as Father of Dragons (a bit of a joke about my kids).  I'm occasionally an editor at www.chessvariants.com, and have been known to design a chess variant or three.                        </div>

                            Hey I'm Tom, yet another of the NC crowd.  Seems to be a lot of us.  I'm 43 and married to a great woman, have 3 fantastic kids (at least two fledgling gamers!), am a research biologist in RTP.  I've been gaming off and on (mostly off) since D&amp;D first came out (purple box, red book) mostly with Rolemaster and MERP.  I rediscovered gaming both RPG and boardgames recently.  And this cool "Story Game" thingy in the last few months thanks to podcasts.  All you podcasters rock!  Thanks.  I'm ready to jump into this with one foot and a couple of toes.<br/>

                            Hello all. My name is Osmo Rantala, I'm a finnish student, my current physical manifestation has accumulated 17 Earth years of age and I enjoy roleplaying games, storytelling games (especially the narrative RPG kind), board games, some console games (FF7 stole my heart away), art, the making of art, fiction and the making of fiction.<br/>
<br/>
Recently I have started designing games of my own (that is, I have started designing games with real potential, as opposed to just being practical copies of games I have enjoyed), and I hope this community will be helpful for doing just that.<br/>

Have a good day, everyone.                        </div>

                            Hi folks!  I'm Chris McNeilly, 31, and go by donbaloo anywhere else on the internet.  I'm very happily married (closing in on 3 years now) to a beautiful and brilliant gal, Melani.  She took my gaming interests well into stride and adopted them for herself which was really cool.  No kids yet, though we look forward to it some day down the road, and as for now our three dogs keep us company.<br/><br/>I'm an ecologist for the National Park Service down on the North Carolina/South Carolina line.  I've been in this mood for a few years where I've seriously considered the path of my career and am wondering whether to jump ship into something else.  No real ideas on what yet though.  I graduated from North Carolina State University back in '98 so I have to at least offer up the obligatory "Booo, Jason Morningstar" for working for the Tarheels.  But I don't really mean it...its just a contractual agreement I was roped into upon receiving my diploma.<br/><br/>Lately my wife and I have been spending most of our time mountain biking, skeet shooting, or working in the garden (though that's almost completely wrapped up by this time of year).  It wouldn't be at all uncommon for you to find me shooting basketball, hiking, camping, or trout fishing either.  We don't watch broadcast television, cable, or satellite but its not because we're too good to sit on our lazy rears in front of the tube....its just that our reception stinks and we don't feel like we'd get our moneys worth from service style TV.  So we supplement with plenty of movies and now, several different shows as they're released on DVD (thank you Netflix):  The Office, 24, Deadwood, Lost and now we have Heroes in our cue.  I'm not above a good video game either...and neither is she, assuming we're talking about Guitar Hero!  She's like the plastic guitar version of Slash/Eddie Van Halen!  A typical evening would include us both reading a little before bed.  But not the same book at the same time, unless of course its Harry Potter <a href="/forums/search?Search=%237&amp;Mode=like">#7</a>.  We did indeed read that out loud together.  It beat wrestling for it (she's pretty tough) or having a Guitar Hero faceoff (she would have chewed me up and spit me out).<br/><br/>We're pretty simple really and just live out here in the country.  No neighbors in immediate site but plenty of friends around, which is nice.<br/><br/>As far as gaming history, I started playing D&amp;D with my dad and his friends when I was about 5 or 6.  I can't wait to do the same for my kids some day as it really was a special thing.  Continued with D&amp;D for the next 24 years or so, through every iteration of it, and never even really knew there was anything else out there.  I've gamed with my same close friends forever so its not like I was being introduced to new stuff.  Finally started getting a bit burned out and found RPG.net a couple years ago and OH MY GOD!!  There's a metric crapload of games out there!  Haven't really played much in that time period though outside of tinkering with Burning Wheel off and on, and staying way to active on their forums for a nonplayer.  :-)  Starting to get the itch again though, so I'm spreading the rash to the old group again.<br/><br/>I found this site through some podcasts and through some rantings about this site on another site.  Checked it out and it seems like a pretty laid back place.  I'll most likely be a lurker as my lack of varied gaming experiences doesn't tend to add a whole lot to discussions but every now and then I find I have something to say.  I look forward to hanging out around here.<br/><br/>(To tomg above:  if you're the Tom (Griff, Griffeth,etc. ?) from the Charlotte area that I met at MACE last November, then that's just weird.  I meet you for the first time, about this time last year, don't speak again for a year and I sign up here and BOOM, you're right here signing up as well!  Pretty cool, if that's you that is.)                        </div>

                            Well, as I have started to post here (once or twice), I might as well introduce myself.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Svante  Landgraf, I'm 27, and I've been living in Sweden all my life.<br/>
<br/>
I have a masters in mathematics. Currently I'm studying literature and philosophy as well as teaching maths at the university. I'd like to work as a writer or a graphics designer. I have no idea how to make that happen.<br/>
<br/>
I recently published <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="www.kaleidoskop.se/terone" rel="nofollow">my first game</a> (in Swedish) through <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://stores.lulu.com/dimfrost" rel="nofollow">Lulu</a>. The last few years I've been gaming once a week, mostly American indie games, homebrews or indie-ish adaptions of more mainstream games (Planescape/SotC, for example).<br/>
<br/>
I love games (all kind of games: rpg:s, card games (Magic), board games (Carcassonne), video games (Guitar Hero and Fire Emblem)), literature (Pynchon, Borges, Auster), comics (Invisibles, Planetary),writing, posthistory, ontological terrorism, maps, hourglasses and eighteenth-century typography.                        </div>

                            Hi. I'm Scott Bennie.<br>
<br>
47 male, Canadian, born in Abbotsford BC. Got a bachelor's degree in education from UBC, but got sucked into computer and RPG design instead of teaching.<br>
<br>
I started gaming at V-Con in 1977. It was D&amp;D of course; my first character lasted about thirty minutes before a giant rat bit him, and he died in one blow. Regardless, I enjoyed the game immensely and wanted to play some more, so I did. After an insane "I can write articles too" moment, I was first published in Dragon in 1981. I wrote a number of books for TSR and Hero during the late 1980s and early 1990s. I also contributed to a number of APAs. Computer games sucked up most of my time during the 1990s, I produced/designed numerous titles for Interplay during that decade, earning my geek cred badge by working with the entire cast of Star Trek during several games.<br>
<br>
After 2000, I was cast out of the computer game business and fell like a star back into RPGs. I wrote _Testament_ for Green Ronin in 2003, and _Villainy Amok_ for Hero in 2005. My most recent book is _Gestalt: The Hero Within_ for Blackwyrm, which was released at Gen Con,it's a gooey, 400 page, fourteen-years-in-the-making, no apologies old-school campaign supplement for Champions.<br>
<br>
Despite being pretty traditional in my tastes, I've always looked with excitement the ability of the hobby to tell stories. I think, at its best, it's an artform with educational and transformative power that might make positive contributions to people's lives. I believe artistic expression can be found in both traditional and new approaches to RPGs, and that the worst thing we can do as gamers is to advocate or embrace One True Ways that turn the communities we build into gated fiefs ruled by the virtual equivalent of strata councils.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond that, I recently returned to my roots as a liberal evangelical protestant, which means I pretty much don't agree with anyone's theology or politics. And I lecture too much, and can get way too bloody self-righteous and long-winded for my own good. I also suffer from CMT, and recently had surgery to correct diabetic related retinopathy, so my health and vision suck. Fortunately gaming usually helps keep life fun and introduces me to a lot of good people, and thus I keep going.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Hi, I'm Clint Krause.  I'm 25.  I've been married to my wife, Cassie (an elementary school teacher), for almost 2 years and we're expecting our first child in February. I'm an independent game designer (3fold, Don't Walk in Winter Wood, Roanoke, Urchin) stuck somewhere between the SG/Forge aesthetic and my trad-gaming roots.  I'm also a working musician (drums &amp; percussion), which gives me a lot of free time to work on games.  I have a BA in creative writing and am currently working on my master's in liberal arts.  <br/>
<br/>
Gaming-wise, I grew up playing Rifts, Palladium Fantasy, and MERP (as well as millions of terrible homebrews of my own devising).  I didn't really get into D&amp;D until 3rd edition came out.  In college, I started surfing rpgnet, which got me into Wushu and the idea of indie publishing.  I like my games right in the middle-ground between new-school and old-school.  My goal as a designer is to become something like a festering mutant hybrid of Kevin Siembieda and Luke Crane.  <br/>
<br/>
Aside from gaming, I love music . . . I listen to lots of Metal (right now I'm on a power metal kick:  Dragonforce, Iron Savior, Hammerfall, etc . . .), but I also love reggae, jazz, and lots of hybrid musical styles (my favorite band is 311).  I also love reading and just hanging out with friends.                        </div>

<br/>
I'm Diogo Curado from Lisbon, Portugal (born and raised). I'm 23 and finishing (hopefully) my masters degree on Information Systems and Technology Management, I graduated in Statistics and Information Management. Not working at this time, but working on it (what a cute little word play).<br/>
<br/>
I pratice Kung Fu and Kendo (Japanese fencing) and enjoy travelling and generaly discovering all the things in the world I don't already know, wich starts in music and finishis in whatever is on the other side of "that corner".<br/>
<br/>
I started playing about 7 years ago with Vampire, The Masquerade and "moved" on to other WW games, recently I've (finally) discovered the joy in D&amp;D and other kinds of games, like Dogs In The Vineyard and Capes. Currently my gaming crown jewels (in no particular order) are Vampire: The Masquerade 3rd Ed (yes I like the game, live with it), Exalted 2nd Ed, Don't Rest Your Head, Capes and Dogs In The Vineyard.<br/>
<br/>
All the best,<br/>

                            Hmmm, I'm not so good at writing about myself in narrative style, which is why I had someone else write my bio for Norwescon, so I'll just do it in bullet points.<br/>
<br/>
-I'm 34.<br/>
-I studied history at Central Washington University, but didn't graduate.<br/>
-I did get a two year dassociates from Wenatchee Valley College.<br/>
-I'm originally from Wenatchee washington, and i really hate it there.<br/>
-I currently live in renton Washington a suburb outside Seattle.<br/>
-I've been married for thirteen years. My wife is a program co-ordinator at the University of Washington School of Dentistry (she feeds and waters dentists). She's also an avid gamer, and writes a blog, a geek culture column, and a sex advice column.<br/>
-We have six cats, several fishtanks, and are currently between hedgehogs.<br/>
-We share a house with a good friend.<br/>
-I was a cook for several years, then a student, and then a nightclub bouncer for eight years until I burned out completely on service jobs.<br/>
-I currently work as a caster for Privateer Press. I like this job a lot. It's nice to work for a company where everyone understands my obsessions on at least some level.<br/>
-I'm and athiest and lean left politically, but I'd rather chew razor blades than talk about religion or politics.<br/>
-I went to culinary school briefly, and learned a lot from working in restaraunts, but I feel my best education as a chef comes from trial and error in the kitchen. I consider myself an amazing chef. It's the one thing I allow myself to be truly arrogant about.<br/>
-I watch pro-wrestling, but gave up on the WWE last year due to stupid plotlines and sexist crap. i get my wrestling fixes from NWA-TNA and various indy vids on youtube. I'll talk about the game about wrestling i'm working on in a different post.<br/>
-I'm a music geek with wide and varied tastes and a lot of inflammatory opinions about it. I find I can now talk nicely about gaming, but i don't know if I'll ever be able to do that about music.<br/>
-I have a livejournal where I talk about a lot of stuff, and sometimes about nothing at all. you can find it on my profile.<br/>
-My wife says I have to say that I'm dead sexy, well, so is she, sexier by far than I am.                        </div>

                            Let's see.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm married to Ogremarco and he told me I needed to join the forum.<br/>
I'm 36<br/>
We've been married for 13 years and together for 14.  <br/>
We have six cats, three fishtanks and will soon have another hedgepig.  <br/>
In addition to gaming, I write, knit and read absolutely everything I can get my hands on.  I also cross-stitch.  <br/>
This spring my knitting group and I are planning on knitting a life-sized Dalek.<br/>
I have an AA, a BA and am a thesis and paying up my student loans enough to graduate from getting my Master's in Russian Feminist History.<br/>
I actually SPEAK three languages (English, French and Russian).  <br/>
I can read and write two more (Ancient Greek and Latin)<br/>
I work at a major university, babysitting dentists, but I'm considering a return to the tech field to save my sanity.<br/>
I was a bouncer and a bartender for 7or 8 years. <br/>
I also collect comic books and all things Nightcrawler. <br/>
I write Geek Girls Rule! for http://www.mediagauntlet.com, I also write the column "Valerie Strangiato:  Advice for the Sexually Inquisitive."   Geek Girls Rule! also has a Wordpress blog. <br/>
I spent several years in the Tech industry once before, which was why I went back to grad school for history.<br/>
My list of jobs includes:  Clown, Hunting Dog Trainer/Kennel Help, Picture Framer, Phone Survey, babysitting, Hotel night desk clerk, shipping and receiving, bookstore cashier, and more I'm forgetting.<br/>
I also like wrestling, but can't watch WWE anymore.  TNA is also starting to get on my nerves with the sexist bullshit, but at least some of their girls look sturdy enough to be taken seriously. <br/>
I love music, and Ogremarco and I frequently clash over our tastes in music (I married a music facist).<br/>
I'm pretty sure that my bloodstream is at least 60% coffee.                        </div>

                            I said some of this in an earlier post, but figured I'd join in with the introductions. I'm Michael Erb, a journalist in West Virginia. I am the education reporter for The Parkersburg News. I'm married, have two boys ages 2 and 6, and I'll be 33 at the end of the year.<br/>
<br/>
I write two gaming columns, one for the newspaper and one for another publication, doing reviews of non-electronic games as well as a "Dad's Eye View" column  for a local parents magazine. <br/>
<br/>
Other than gaming, my hobbies are writing, comic books, poetry and just about anything sci-fi or fantasy. I got heavily into board games about 3 years ago, though I've played RPGs since I was about 10. <br/>
<br/>
I grew up in Williamstown, WV, and met my wonderful wife while we were attending West Virginia University in Morgantown, WV. I ran out of money while going to school so I got a Board of Regents degree before we moved to Beaufort, SC, and I went to work as a copy editor for The Island Packet near Hilton Head, SC. I worked there for more than 3 years, eventually becoming the education reporter for that publication. After the birth of my first son being 13 hours from family just got to be too much, so we moved back up to this area, and I went to work for the News. <br/>
<br/>
We just bought a new house in Williamstown and are still getting unpacked. I'm looking for a new job because of the cost of the new home, but it makes me ill to think of not writing for a living, so we'll have to see how that one goes.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that's all I got for now.<br/>

-Lived 14 years of my life in the states and I don't see myself ever going back for long.<br>
-Will be married for two years this coming February.<br>
-Graduated with a degree in History from Wesleyan University.<br>
-Can speak English and Spanish well, Korean somewhat and a very limited smattering of French, Norwegian and Arabic.<br>
-Am a good cook and homebrewer and good food, good beer and an internet connection are all the material things I really need to keep myself sane.<br>
-Currently my favorite RPG is SotC and am currently trying to make an RPG that can do historical fiction/gritty low fantasy (think George Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire books) as well as SotC does pulp.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            My real name is Darren, and I'm 38.  I live in Kansas City, MO with my girlfriend Denise, and moved here over 3 years ago from Florida.  I grew up in Massachusetts in a little town on the border to New Hampshire.<br><br>I have a BA in English and have a work background as an Administrative Asst.  The company I worked for closed it's doors in June, so I've been working as a temp while I search for permanent employment.<br/><br/>I spent some time in the SCA in college, where I also developed a love for fencing and racquetball.<br/><br/>I have a passion for cinema, which I attribute to my Dad, an immense DVD collection, and an unhealthy affection for Mystery Science Theatre 3000.  I also read a lot of comic books and graphic novels.  I've been known to watch some anime, but I'm pretty shallow - it has to be extremely pretty to catch my eye.<br/><br/>I don't like spicy foods (I'm half-Canadian in ancestry, so salt is an exotic spice), and I don't drink often; when I do it's usually something fruity with an umbrella in it.<br/><br/>I have no pets at present, but I'm very fond of dogs and cats.<br/><br/>I enjoy computer and console games.<br/><br/>I was introduced to gaming by way of the old D&amp;D boxed set that came with numbered chits instead of dice.<br/><br/>I've discovered that the game genres I love most are swashbuckling, wu-xia, espionage and superheroes.  The games I enjoy most are: Seventh Sea, Nobilis, Mutants and Masterminds, The Adventureas of Baron Munchausen, Qin, Weapons of the Gods, Spirit of the Century, Spycraft, Top Secret, and Castle Falkenstein.<br/><br/>I wanted to love Exalted, but the game was too crunchy, and although we saw each other for several books, the relationship ended when we realized we weren't right for one another.<br/><br/>I was a tremendous fan of Mage: The Ascension's previous editions.  I've avoided the new edition in case I might enjoy it. <br/><br/>I have no interest in writing or publishing a game, but will be happy to be a consumer.                        </br></br></div>

                            The roleplaying started started at around age eleven. I got the Swedish game Drakar och Demoner (Dragons and Demons, as (almost) all Swedish rpg before 2005 a Basic roleplayng clone). It said from age twelve on the boc, so I didn't get to worried when I didn't understand how to play. Instead me and my friend Kristoffer played with just a six sided die. I played the hero, he GM:ef for a lot of years until other games started to drop in.<br/><br/>At the university roleplaying turned fun again. White Wolf games, Swedish art-house larp, Swedish freeform and rpg-cons. People started to make their own games. Now I am 28 and it seem - which is rather bisarre, I think - like roleplaying just gets more with age.<br/><br/>During the last two years I have lived and worked in Turkey. I mainly moved there to follow the woman of my choice. Because of this I have played very little during the last two years. Right at this moment I am in Sweden again for a few months. I will go back to Turkey again and before that time I will try to do quite a bit of roleplaying.<br/><br/>I am also a master of science and engineering and have an unfinished bachelor degree in comparative literature (on the Swedish pronographic novel 1967-71).                        </div>

                            Hi! My name's Elizabeth. I'm 25 and currently living in Columbus, OH, though that should change this spring. I'm a single mom, and I have more hobbies than could possibly be construed as healthy: I'm learning to play the guitar, I design jewelry, I love to cook, I self-publish <a href="http://www.catharsismagazine.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">a quarterly literary and art magazine,</a> I design games, and sometimes, I even find people to PLAY games with me!<br/><br/>I'm a voracious reader, and like graphic novels, turn-of-the-century English lit, and weirdo non-fiction. I want to write a game about the Black Panther movement in the 60s, if I can ever reach down inside my white-girl self and find the balls. I'm also a big fan of Simon Bolivar, and my favorite US president is the tragically misunderstood LBJ. I also like children's lit.<br/><br/>Oh! I'm a <a href="http://www.elizabethshoemaker.com" rel="nofollow">photographer</a> by trade. Portraiture is my first love-- weird portraiture especially-- but if it is visible to the human eye, I will figure out what makes it compelling, and then take a picture of it.<br/><br/>What else..<br/><br/>I have mutant pinky toes, I refuse to eat anything that's blue, I'm voracious when it comes to travel and new experiences, and I make a weird face when my nose is cold. Oh, and I could totally kick your butt at Super Smash Bros.<br/><br/>I think that covers it.                        </div>

                            Halo! I'm Mike Stevens, 28 and live in San Jose, Ca.<br/>
<br/>
Up until October, I worked as a video game tester for 6 years for a big name 3rd party publisher and just yesterday got a job as a editor for a comic book company. My heritage is mostly European, and on one side of my family, it can be traced all the way to the Mayflower.  At this point, I'd tell you about my non-gaming hobbies but all of them tend to be intertwined. I've been a fan of games ever since I was three years old, when my parents got me a Colecovision for Christmas. I began playing RPGs when I was in 5th grade- my first one was TMNT and other Strangeness, followed up by Robotech in Jr. High, Cybergeneration and Deadlands in High School. <br/>
<br/>
I play all kinds of games be it card, board, role playing or video. I mostly got out of CCGs after the death of Doomtown, although I'm rather proud how I managed to foster a few regular groups who played the game in the bay area until the game died an untimely demise. Because of my volunteer ambassador programs I was involved in, I eventually worked with a local anime convention and managed their tabletop gaming dept, making it a haven for all games, not just Pokemon and D&amp;D, for five years before one of those ugly volunteer power plays came about.<br/>
I enjoy MST3K, collect way too much Anime, Comics and have enough video games (both ones I worked on and didn't) to choke a Chocobo. I also enjoy telling stories, and occasionally write comic scripts that an artist friend and I collaborate on.<br/>
Right now, I've been playing in the same group as Neko Ewen and running OVA.<br/>
<br/>
I'm considered the "zombie hunting" guy by my friends, mostly due to my love of Resident Evil games (I don't own or see too many zombie flicks out there, honest) and if not that, the original jolly green giant, Cthulhu.<br/>
<br/>
This being my second post here on Story Games, I look forward in posting a bit more.                        </div>

                            I'm Brennen Reece. 32 years old. Married to Sarah, who paints wonderful watercolor portraits. I currently teach guitar at a music store in Auburn, Alabama. Until four years ago I worked as an art director for a small advertising agency, before that in reverse chronology I was a: graphic designer, interactive design specialist for Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, medical writer, antique restoration specialist, film student, barista, scenic artist, propmaker.<br/>
<br/>
I love (&amp; play) jazz, blues, and country fingerstyle guitar. I'm fond of Henry Miller, Tom Waits, Federico Fellini, Hammer Films, Mario Bava, and Edward Gorey. Everything I design utilizes the Golden Ratio, or at least the Fibonacci Series. My favorite sans serif is Univers, with Akzidens Grotesque a close second. I prefer Jan Tschihold's reworking of Garamond, Sabon, for my serif typeface. You'll never catch me using Arial or Times New Roman.<br/>
<br/>
After spending my twenties as a literature and film snob, I'm enjoying some more literary escapism: China Mieville, Neil Gaiman, Robert Heinlein, and lots of old vampire and haunted house stories from the 19th century. I also like REALLY bad horror movies, and really good ones.<br/>
<br/>
Food is my drugs. My wife thinks I'd eat at an Asian restaurant every day if I could...the truth is, Asian is the only ethnic alternative in Auburn. I'll drive an hour for good pho. I also make a mean paella.<br/>
<br/>
I don't like American beer or American football.<br/>
<br/>
I run a Gothic horror campaign online using Fantasy Grounds. Somehow, all my players are Canadian. If you're Canadian and want to play in an online Gothic horror campaign, let me know. The game started out as a heavily-housefuled True20, moved to a heavily-housefuled Simple20, and we're now switching to FATE because I kept yelling "AMEN!" on every page. I can't wait for the generic FATE 3.0 book to come out...nudge, nudge...                        </div>

                            Ok time to stop lurking and post - well at least post on this post - thanks for the bump....<br/>
<br/>
I'm Greg ..... I'm really old (41) and have been a "gamer" since the late 70's......<br/>
<br/>
I am of western European descent (mostly Scotts Welsh and Italian and possibly Dutch) and have lived exclusively on the West Coast of the United States. Currently Reside in Seattle and work for Privateer Press in the Shipping Dept. (Hi Ogre)<br/>
<br/>
I have been into Science Fiction/ Fantasy as long as I can recall, I can blame it on my Dad if I want but I really love the genre so I won't. I really like old pulp/serial era stories and am not ashamed to say I get a kick out of good wrestling now and again. (Hell Buffy I often called soap oprea with combat.....and hell how could that not e fun sometimes.......). I guess if anything I can say that I have always been more of a collector then a doer ----- but I really do love gaming and am glad that a friend of mine has talked me into not just collecting and reading them as I have for more years then I want to admit to. <br/>
<br/>
I have the luck to be involved with a woman that may not understand or want to be involved in gaming but encourages me to do what I like and want me to be more social with my friends......<br/>
<br/>
I enjoy cooking and according to her do pretty well at it and in the past have considered it as a possible career but being a vegetarian limits me a bit. When we saty wioth friends I "pay" for our stays by cooking so I guess I can trust her opinion. <br/>
<br/>
I have often tried my hand at game design and have really gotten the bug again ..... would like to try Game Chef in 2008 if it happens and I can do so.......<br/>
<br/>
I am a trained Make-up artist(love working theater) and cosmetologist (yes I have done hair too).....<br/>
<br/>
I wold list the games that I have owned and played but that list would be long - maybe I will do that on my live journal or facebook page....<br/>
<br/>
I would love to do more playtests (I have done some in the past - recent) and have written reviews professionally......well semi ---- well I got paid for them ......<br/>
<br/>
anyway that is me well at lest a little -<br/>

                            Wow, this is a long thread.<br/>
<br/>
As you may or may not be able to tell from my mysterious handle, my name is Jesse Coombs. I'm 28. I live in Sacramento, CA, which I like and think that people put down a little too much. I'm a receiving manager at Barnes and Noble, and I'm fantastic at customer service and retail, and very flaky at school, which apparently is not for me.<br/>
<br/>
My "education" for the last half of my life has been a steady mixture of pop culture, movies, indie rock, and comic books. Playing rpgs with friends is one of the best things ever, and having a bad experience is like dragging my teeth on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
I'm always broke, and usually looking for a girlfriend. Those two things almost always go together.<br/>
<br/>
One day I'll open my own movie palace, but until then...I work.                        </div>

                            Hi, my name is Antoine Fournier. I am 32 and born in Toulouse, France. I studied History then Applied Arts then Computer Science.<br/>I met Marie in my fifth college year and we've lived together since then. We married in 2001. We have a two years old girl named Jeanne who's cuter, smarter and taller than any 4 years old boy in town.<br/>We moved from Paris two years ago and came back around Toulouse where we both used to live until 2000. We live now in the countryside in a 200 years old farm that I inherited from my father.<br/><br/>Marie and I work at home together as independant graphic and web designers. I want some day to draw full time on my own comics or on illustration works.<br/>Drawing is my main obsession. With RPGs too of course. I started to draw suddenly when I was 20 and while I love it, it didn't come naturaly to me. There will be probably more on that soon in an appropriate thread as I'd like to mix drawing comics and story gaming. Some day I will.<br/><br/>On the RPG side : I started to play RPGs at 12 with Red Box D&amp;D. Then AD&amp;D, MERP, Warhammer, Cthulhu, lots of french games, WoD, etc... One day I was forced to admit I wasn't enjoying myself as much as I used to do. There was the Internet. I searched there for answers.<br/>I've read the Forge since 2002 and Story Games since it exists. My first post here was on november 16th 2007. They call people like me lurkers... So, yes : it was about time I introduced myself.<br/><br/>I usualy play with Marie and our friend Jérôme. Sometimes with some others friends who were all my pals (and rpg buddies) in highschool. I wish we could play more often together.<br/><br/>My current loves are the Red Box Hack (which needs another title now), Beast Hunters, Spirit of the Century, Dread, Trollbabe and Sugarfighter Black.<br/><br/>Preparing for game mastering has always been a big stress but thanks to Graham W's "Play Unsafe", <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5044&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">it seems not to be anymore</a>.<br/><br/>Regarding RPG design, I have some ideas about a gamist card-game and story-game hybrid. I'd like to test it as soon as I can make a prototype version of the cards.<br/><br/>I already wrote too much.                        </div>

                            It's probably time that I gave a formal introduction.  My name is Ram Lama H.  I'm a cartoonist from Wichita, KS.  I've had the honor of meeting a few of you at GenCon2007, where I was a part of the Ashcan Front.  My ashcan was the Path of Journeys, something of a fantasy heartbreaker that I came up with by putting Everway, Dogs in the Vineyard, Burning Wheel, i ching, and neopaganism in a bag and shaking vigorously.<br/><br/>I currently have two webcomics up and running.  The first is <a href="http://www.achanceinhell.smackjeeves.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">A Chance in Hell</a>, a fantasy/horror comic inspired by a condition called visual snow that I suffer from.  The second is <a href="http://www.illustratedramblings.smackjeeves.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Illustrated Ramblings,</a> an editorial comic and one of the rare examples of paid journalist cartooning.  I'm working on the former because I want to feel prolific again.  The latter is published weekly in my college newspaper.<br/><br/>I was first introduced to gaming at age 11 by my childhood mentor, who originally played DnD in the 70's and 80's and came out of retirement just long enough to teach me the rules so I could start DMing for my friends.  My first experiments with game design were in middle school; "so, that's how DnD works... what if we wanted to play a game in space?" and "so, that's how dice work... what if if we use these other dice in this other way?"<br/><br/>I'd love to open up shop doing freelance illustrations, but I haven't been able to beat my website into shape yet.  More importantly, I have to beat my personal demons into shape.  I still have a bit to do before I feel comfortable and competent, but I've made a lot of progress in the past six months.<br/><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Photobucket" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v606/Doplegager/20080103009.jpg" style="border: 0px;"/><br/>"Our promises are only as genuine as the delusions that they are based on"</div> </div>

                            I'm Alexander Cherry - I made <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=227&amp;page=2#Item_21" rel="nofollow">a post here on March 1, 2006</a> about myself. I figured it's worth updating myself:<br/><br/>I'm 28, going to be 29 this upcoming year. In theory by August I'll have a double bachelor's degree in mathematics and economics. Thanks to econ I've got a nice helping of game theory on my plate. And no, I have no idea what I want to do with those degrees. <br/><br/>I consider myself agnostic probably bordering on atheist, and more-or-less consider most religion kind of the enemy (I'm always taken aback when someone who shows themselves to be thoughtful and intelligent turns out to have a religion).<br/><br/>I live in Phoenix, Arizona, where I feel it gets a bit chilly in the winter (note to you crazies who live where it snows, 'a bit chilly' is different from 'inhospitably cold'), and it rains too much here.<br/><br/>I'm taking numerous improvisation courses and could be considered to be a member of at least one improv theatre troupe here in Phoenix, which seems to be becoming sort of a mecca for improvisers out west. Which is awesome for me. <br/><br/>I'm a motorcycle rider that's never taken the test to drive a car. Legally, <a href="http://www.bikerworld.co.uk/roadtests/victory_v92/vegas.jpg" rel="nofollow">my two-wheeled contraption</a> is the only thing I can drive. <br/><br/>While abroad in Spain, in June, 2007, I started having convulsions - an apparently common symptom for having an oligodendroglioma, a brain tumor that grows between the cells. On June 18 I had surgery to have enough of it removed that I could be symptom free, and on December 20 I had even more removed to keep it from growing back.  I might live until I'm 50.<br/><br/>I enjoy reading fiction. Not so much non-fiction. I pride myself on living a paperless life (it's a pun that basically means no newspapers). <br/><br/>As the original post says, I'm a game publisher through the <a>Twisted Confessions label</a> that I created myself. I've put out the awesome game <b>Fastlane</b> through Twisted Confessions and through the <a href="http://www.nopress.net" rel="nofollow">No Press Anthology</a>, <b>Snowball</b>. Also it seems page hits makes my <b>Creeks and Crawdads</b> homage to be the talk of the town. I miss doing more game design, and hope to make myself do some soon. I'm really hoping to get the twisted confessions imprint re-done as an ambigram.<br/><br/>I'm always on the look out for more roleplaying games, ideally to play. In games, I crave mechanical structure and support, especially interaction with the mechanics while hanging out in the Shared Imaginative Space. Without that I can't say things feel enough like /games/ to be games. If all it asks me to do is make scenes, but I can't interact with the mechanics while playing, I feel unfulfilled. Otherwise it's just freeform play, which is not enough of a game for me to want when wanting to play a game.<br/><br/>When a child, I went to an independently run school for "gifted" children. As a result, I don't quite 'get' most references to school grades and the like (we didn't label our classes by number) and most of my knowledge of the American high school experience is taken from movies and books, etc. I had a graduating class of 3.<br/><br/>I found D&amp;D when I was 6 years old, and while it never quite satisfied me even then, voraciously reading the books (as I could not find people to play) was surely a formative experience on my life. As a socially stunted person, I found it very difficult to gather people together to play, a struggle I continue with to this day. <br/><br/>Eventually I branched out into the palladium books, TMNT especially, then Robotech. After that, Rifts. My current rpg bookshelves seem to be the envy of most who view them, although I have a Wall of Shame comprised of the old World of Darkness splatbooks. I picked up Werewolf before Vampire although I'd known about Vampire - a girl I had a crush on asked me about it once. <br/><br/>"Design" started for me as a kid when I created conversion materials between my favorite games. After that, my mom decided to punish me by taking my books away, so I figured 'okay screw that, I can come up with something on my own'. And so, I did.<br/><br/>I find myself seeing red when coming across pointless, obfuscatory number/word trees as in FUDGE, etc. (especially when cluttering up game texts, when the words are just labeled with the numbers). These cause me more frustration than benefit. <br/><br/>Found the Forge in 2003 through an invitation to the Indie Rpg chatroom. I made huge rpg purchases those days.  These days, price tags above $20 make me wary, and above $29 make me wonder whether I should go somewhere else to get a better product - especially if the price tag seems directly related to things that don't really add to the in-play experience, like a hardcover or interior art.<br/><br/>Since there seems to be a common thread of relationship status in here, I'm single and have been for quite some time. I'm not good at meeting people, unless you count the internet, making a social life kind of un-possible. Yay for social phobias?                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paulie</cite>I am Paul Wilson, 27 and a am analtical chemist from Wellington, New Zealand.</blockquote>
Heh. My wife is a biogeochemist, and we're going to be moving to Wellington in (hopefully) just a few months. She's got a job there, and we're working through the visa stuff now.<br/><br/>Anyway, on-topic...<br/><br/>Howdy, I'm Chris Fletcher.<br/>I'm 35, married to a really groovy woman for the last 11 years, although we've been together about 15 years. She plays rpgs too, although it's a bit more a case of being something we can do together, instead of her being really into rpgs.<br/><br/>I started playing rpgs some 20 years ago, with the Red Box D&amp;D set. Since then I've played so many different games, I can't remember them all. These days I tend to like the small press stuff more, but I still play D&amp;D too. I don't consider myself a "gamer" although I do enjoy playing rpgs. I tend to prefer systems on the lighter side, and a lot of the reason I play is for social stuff. I've been known to hangout with a buddy that's playing some videogame, and just enjoy being with him and sharing in the experience of him playing. Sure, participating is fun too, but I don't find it to be a requirement.<br/><br/>My better half has a Ph.D. but I'm not really that well educated. I grew up pretty poor to start out with, and I've been adopted a couple of times. Self-educated from 3rd grade until I went to college about 8 years ago. I went through an interpreting program and graduated as an ASL Interpreter (American Sign Language). Worked in school systems from Kindergarten up through University.<br/><br/>Back in September I told my wife, "I've left my life on hold long enough, and it's killing me. I've spent the last 20 years doing marginal jobs and the only kind of creative outlet I get is through rpg stuff. I want to go back to school and get a B.A. or a B.S. or _something_. Just to prove I'm really not as stupid as I feel. I want to try and get it in something that might be useful in some fashion, but even if it isn't... I want to get something." She asked me what I was thinking of, and I had to admit...art.<br/><br/>Nope, I haven't spent years drawing stuff. Half the time I look at paintings and I'm bored stiff. I do firmly believe that a person that has sufficient motivation can learn to do almost anything. Might not do as well as the "naturally gifted" folks do, but they can come close. I've got a good sense of what I like in art (my wife says it'd be classed as "popular art") and my plan is to go through and get my education as an illustrator. I figure I can transfer those skills to a computer after I get the good solid foundation stuff down. My eventual hope is to do graphic design for the regular job, and use my art abilities to do rpg stuff and my own projects on the side. So far my art teachers have been quite encouraging and even though I'm behind the curve compared to a lot of the kids in the classes, I'm pleased with my progress.<br/><br/>By nature I'm quite friendly, by nurture I avoid people. For anyone that's ever seen Clerks, there's an amusing bit when the two characters are talking and one complains about not going to a party. The other guy says, "But you hate people!" and the first guy says, "Yeah, but I love gatherings. Ironic, isn't it?" That's kinda me. I tend to lurk more often than not. A lot of it comes from the fact that I'm just not interested in arguing about stuff. I try to be helpful when possible, otherwise I just watch. More often than not it seems that "discussions" are really arguments, and I'm confident that someone else will be along to make whatever point I might feel should be made.<br/><br/>I shave my head, lift weights and run, have both my ears pierced, and a tattoo. I'm also co-owner of the cat, although my wife bitterly complains that she thinks the cat likes me better.<br/><br/>If I were to stake some sort of claim of being "different", it's probably the animals I love. Platypuses are at the top of the list, followed by monkeys (and apes too) and then my final "top" love (my wife claims it's an unholy thing) is for the hairless cat. No the cat we've got isn't a hairless one, but it is a shelter rescue cat. <br/><br/>I'm a bit of an oddity when it comes to games, in that the community associated with the game is almost as important to me as what the rules look like. It might not make sense to a lot of other folks, but that's the way it is for me. I figure that rpgs are at least somewhat social, and if I don't like the folks that I keep running into that are into the game, then it's just not a game I should be interested in.                        </div>

                            My name's Shane Ivey. I've lurked here for ages but didn't get around to signing up until a few days ago. I was 36 when this thread started and am 38 now. Married nearly 15 years and we hope to take our first international trip together this fall to visit the U.K.; I've been a couple of times and love it there, and my wife's a longtime Anglophile and can't wait to go. We have three kids, ages 12, 11 and (in twelve days) 9. The notion that roleplaying is mainly for maladjusted sad-sacks amuses me. We live in Birmingham, Alabama.<br/>
<br/>
My wife has played RPGs a few times and had fun but isn't an enthusiast. My kids love them as long as the rules are either uncomplex or handled by somebody else. I strongly wish WOTC would take the opportunity of a new edition of D&amp;D to make it a palatable gateway game for smart kids, the way AD&amp;D was for me, but I can't say I have hope for it.<br/>
<br/>
I started gaming in 1979 with the Basic D&amp;D set that had the dragon on the cover staring at the wizard and the guy in platemail holding a bow. (I know -- a D&amp;D character in platemail holding a bow? What kind of madness was that? And these were 1D6 arrows where you didn't get a Strength bonus to damage; crazy artists.)<br/>
<br/>
Over the years I played mostly AD&amp;D at first, then left AD&amp;D before 2nd Edition and played mostly RuneQuest 3, Palladium FRP, Champions, Cyberpunk and Call of Cthulhu. Loved Cthulhu most of all those but ran and played more RQ, Cyberpunk and Champions. I also played a good bit of the Ringworld RPG way back when and used to own it and the supplements, but they accidentally stayed with a friend when I moved from Sacramento at age 20 and I never saw them again. Same thing happened to my autographed original run of Uncanny X-Men from the Dark Phoenix saga through "Days of Future Past"; it still hurts.<br/>
<br/>
For several years I played on a couple of MUSHes very heavily, first the short-lived Danse Macabre (a medieval vampire MUSH; I didn't give a flip about the vampire stuff but loved the medieval intrigue) and longer on the Middle-earth-themed Elendor (I ran Mordor for a while in the late '90s).<br/>
<br/>
I run RPG company Arc Dream Publishing and also work for boardgame publisher Avalanche Press, and occasionally help my mother manage rental properties that my grandmother owns. I used to do a lot of freelance work but my schedule was so rough that I constantly missed deadlines (sorry, Green Ronin!) and gave it up. I founded and technically still own RevolutionSF.com, but I haven't had time to do much with it myself lately.<br/>
<br/>
Before working on games full-time I was a magazine editor for the University of Alabama at Birmingham, a copy editor for the Birmingham News, and a webmaster and writer for Hecklers Online, a dot-com that crashed spectacularly in classic dot-com fashion. Before that I attended law school for a couple of years in Brooklyn and strove mightily to become an FBI agent, and was *this* close to making it but got redlined out because of that time I took LSD. My wife is a tremendouly popular DARE officer, but she hasn't yet asked me to come be an object lesson.<br/>
<br/>
Apropos of not much, I haven't yet played Spirit of the Century but hope to get my group to play it soon. Most recently I ran <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://revolutionsf.com/iveymojo/aces.php" rel="nofollow">Aces and Eights</a>, which was a huge departure in terms of the level of crunch that my group and I usually can tolerate these days, but we ended up having a lot of fun with it. Our next games will probably be Savage Worlds with pirates, a Rome noir game using HeroQuest rules, and probably Traveller before it's my turn to GM again.                        </div>

                            I'm late to this thread.<br><br>I'm Viktor Haag. I'm a forty-two (well, this is my forty-second year, anyway) father of two children, and husband to a woman who I met in a local volleyball league eleven years ago. With the small exception of the first four years of my wife's life, where she lived 100 kilometres from our current location, and a year of my life when I lived abroad in Europe, we both have spent our entire lives including childhood, education, and work all within a 30 kilometre radius here in Southern Ontario, Canada.<br><br>I am a baptized conference Mennonite (largely non-practicing) with modern and slightly agnostic sensibilities. My wife is a slightly less non-practicing Catholic. Our children are currently being educated at a Catholic school simply because it's closer, newer, cleaner, and seemingly safer than the Public alternative. When they enter high-school, this trend will almost certainly reverse itself, and instead of walking one direction for 10 minutes to get to school, they'll walk the other direction for 10 minutes to get to their Public high-school (because it's closer, newer, cleaner, and seemingly safer than the Catholic alternative).<br><br>I am, by trade, an explainer of technology, almost entirely by the written word. I suppose this makes me a "technical writer", but I don't write user manuals, and I haven't for years. For the last 6 or 7 years, nearly all the writing I have been doing explains a portion of my company's technical architecture to other technical folks within my own company. My wife is, by trade, an early childhood educator who expressed a desire to stay at home and manage our household when our second child arrived, and to all appearances hasn't spent a single moment in regret over that decision. This makes her, and by extension me, and our children, very lucky people (in my opinion).<br><br>For exercise I play basketball on a fairly dedicated, but pickup, basis and have done so for about 10 years. Prior to that, my efforts were devoted to competitive volleyball. In college, I played (recreational) competitive soccer, touch football, volleyball, and basketball. I have, occasionally, studied Judo, Karate, Aikido, and Tai Chi. Despite all these physical exertions I generally think of myself as a not-very-active person especially when compared to my parents and their siblings who seem physically grafted to their bicycles, hiking, and skiing gear, not to mention their farming and woodcutting implements.<br><br>For leisure, I read, watch movies and sports, and a little television (although, these days, almost all of my television is watched either on DVD or time-delayed off my PVR; I hardly watch anything live any more), and also tinker around with my various bits of computing equipment (almost entirely Macintosh OSX machines). I do not play computer games, much to the confusion of most of my friends.<br><br>I have been playing games of all other sorts (card, board, role) since early childhood, roleplaying in particular since my teenage years. My "regular gaming" has been spent playing with the same general group of people for almost 25 years, nearly all of us family men and professionals. A few years ago I formed another regular group of players including my wife and a couple we're friends with. We have played fairly regularly for four or five years, but have had long hiaitii when our friends decided first to make a year-long world hiking tour, and then subsequently, to have a baby (which has just happened: welcome to the world, Moira!)<br/><br/>At least once a week, our family plays boardgames (of which I have an embarrassingly large collection to go with my embarrassingly large collection of rolegames). Fairly regularly I write about the boardgames I've played, the books I've read, and various other topics that catch my notice on <a href="http://viktor-haag.livejournal.com/" rel="nofollow">my blog</a> which you are all free to visit and read, if you'd like.<br/><br/>Occasionally I make contributions to this forum, but really not often enough.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Greetings!<br/><br/>I'm DainXB on the Internet, Harold Michael Lybarger in official correspondence (the 'Harold' is silent <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>).  Everyone I know except for my sister and my neice calls me 'Dain' in person, including my in-laws and the people at work.  (All because 'Dain Bjornsson' was the name I chose for my SCA persona, years ago.  Complicated yet uninteresting story, there...)<br/><br/>I'm 45 years old, and live in St. Louis, Missouri.  The work I get paid to do is Casino Surveillance, although my two previous jobs were in the burglar/fire/process-control alarm industry.  Working in Surveillance is almost, but not exactly, completely unlike what you see on that 'Vegas' show on TV. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  In a roundabout way, though, I fight crime for a living, which I think is cool.<br/><br/>I'm married, and one of the lucky ones; my lovely wife Jill is a gamer girl, and all-around girl geek.  We met in college through a combination of the SCA and Archon, one of the local St. Louis science fiction conventions.  She currently runs the Dealer's Room for Archon, in fact.  (Come visit us in October!)  Mundanely, she is the Assistant Manager of a Teavanna store.<br/><br/>I attended college at the University of Missouri, Rolla, and at Southeast Missouri State University;  Computer Science with a minor in History.  I am a practicing history geek as well as a science fiction and fantasy geek.  I'm also a fan of mystery novels.  My other hobbies include comic books; model rocketry, video games; building PCs; and lately, cooking.  <br/><br/>I've been obese all my life, but in the past two years, I have managed to lose 150 pounds and keep it off, and I am inordinately proud of that fact.<br/><br/>I am an atheist, my wife is a neo-Pagan.  <br/><br/>I started in gaming with board wargames ('Sorcerer', from SPI, to be exact), and got into RPGs with a copy of Blue Box Basic D&amp;D, ordered from an ad in the back of Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine.  I've been a gamer ever since.  I co-wrote a couple of 'Space 1889' articles for 'Challenge' magazine (GDW's house organ) before they folded.  I'm hoping that those two events are not causally related.  I also contributed material to the 'Dark Conspiracy' supplement 'Proto-Dimensions'.  Some day, I would like to get back into print.<br/><br/>--<br/>DainXB                        </div>

                            I am usually known as James, though I've been called worse. I also usually use the nick of "Twilight" or "Yonagi" in some manner or another on various boards. For those of you keeping score, I also happen to be 32 and married. My wife is kind enough to suffer through my role-playing ADD; I have an incessant need to purchase and study rule sets from different systems just to see what they're like.<br/><br/>I've been gaming for about 20 years or so. I started with Moldvay Basic, moved on to Star Frontiers and kind of evolved to different systems from that point on. As I get older, I find myself wanting simpler and simpler systems. That could be attributed to my cantankerous nature or perhaps I don't like being told how a game should be played. <i>In a Wicked Age</i>, <i>Wushu</i> and <i>Sorcerer</i> all qualify as my current interests. Aside from tabletop role-playing, my wife and I also run <a href="http://paragon.invisionzone.com/index.php?" rel="nofollow">Paragon</a>, a forum based elemental wolf RP. Naturally, I think it's freeform RP at its finest, though I am absolutely biased. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I also used to be found on <a href="www.harpers-tale.com" rel="nofollow">Harper's Tale</a> as Seamus. And I collect worthless bits of information.<br/><br/>Worthless trivia regarding James? I used to be left handed, much like, supposedly, a majority of the members of the Kerr clan. I have been rehabilitated to using the right, though I still use the left to eat and open doors and the like. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

I am a Graphical Designer (with an informal specialization in Multimedia Design), and I plan on taking a M.F.A. in Interactive Design and Game Development within the next couple of years. I'm an ammateur writter, a hardcore reader and I like to draw (I draw mostly within a Manga style I like).<br/>
<br/>
I have been gaming for about 13 years (10 of which I have been GMing), but I have liked fantasy and medieval stuff for as long as I can remember. (Some of my favourite toys as a child were capes and swords.) I was "initiated" to the gaming world by my cousins (who are in their middle thirties now), playing ADnD (I'm still mostly a DnD DM and player).                        </div>

                            OK, so, I'm totally new here on SG, but I will introduce myself, I hope to stay here for a while and get some valuable knowledge :)<br/>
<br/>
I'm Magdalena Wilamowska (yes, it's a female name), I'm 22 and I'm from Poland, Europe. I live in a medium-sized city for polish standards. I study english and IT, but I think I still suck on both. I like reading books, especially fantasy books, my favourite author is R.A. Salvatore and I like the whole world of FR. I like watching films with humour and action. I love cats, I have two, and I also have a dog. Oh, and I look like this (I'm the girl on the right):<br/>

I'm into RPG for more than 10 years now and I think I will always love it :) But I'm still quite new in story games, though I play for couple of months now. It's nice to meet you all :)                        </div>

                            Greetings All, I am also new here, and figured it proper to follow this seeming tradition of introductions.<br/>
<br/>
I am Dustin P. Wilson-Henry, 22 from Bloomington, Indiana; a college town whose university was not the one I attended. I work as a production sound mixer for a video and film production company. I have been playing RPGs farther back than I can properly remember, but always felt like the games were not delivering in the play I desired. My favorite games at the time of this writing are Spirit of the Century, Bliss Stage, and Reign;playing them with my group, on the other hand, is out of the question as they are all d20 fanatics due to fear of change. I am also an aspiring designer, with many ideas bubbling about that need more development.<br/>
<br/>
I look  forward to getting to know you and learn from you and maybe help you in turn.                        </div>

                            Greetings.<br/><br/>My name is Tomasz Pudło (nickname kaduceusz) and at the moment I live in Krakow, Poland. I'm 24 years old and it's been been eleven years in gaming for me now. I've started with WFRP and other RPGs I've played for a longer time include MERP on FUDGE, EarthDawn, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dzikie_Pola_(RPG)" rel="nofollow">Dzikie Pola</a> (a polish RPG about 17th century nobility), Deadlands and Eberron played with kaduFATE (my own version of FATE system). As a curiosity I add here that I won Polish Game Masters Challenge in 2006 (yup, we have such a thing!) and polish best known RPG scenario contest (it's called <a href="http://www.quentin.rpg.pl" rel="nofollow">Quentin</a>) in 2007.<br/><br/>At the moment I am, let's call it, chief editor in polish biggest RPGs portal - <a href="http://polter.pl" rel="nofollow">Poltergeist</a>. We try to get polish gamers get to know some of those new-and-brilliant games - actually most of the polish reviews of indie games were written by me. Some translations are on their way, too :-)<br/><br/>I have played a couple of the new ones, including Burning Wheel/Empires, Shock:, Universalis and Dirty Secrets.<br/><br/>Outside gaming I am about to graduate in technology of chemistry. Being a student I listen, read, dance, live on 140 m^2 with 6 other people and work at night shift in a hostel.<br/><br/>Yup, that'd be it.<br/><br/>And BTW: Does this thread have a google map or sth? Because it definitely should :-)                        </div>

                            Interesting... It seems we newcomers are younger than the average age in here. I have always found interesting the fact that gaming is kind of ageless... You can be 12 or 25 or 65 and still enjoy the hobbie a lot. Of course, most people enjoy it diferently as they age, but still...                        </div>

                            Well, my name is Graham, and I'm from London. No, not that London, but a smaller one on the other side of the pond. Our bridges may not be quite as magnificent, but at least they haven't been shipped to Arizona.<br/>

On any given 3am you have a maddeningly decent chance of finding me thrown awake by my muse and working away at one or another game design. As a result, on any given 10am you have an almost equal chance of finding me selling antiquarian books while drowning my tiredness in caffeine. One of these days I hope to move my work desk across the street to the library and get some use out of those fancy papers the university sent me.<br/>
<br/>
I am avidly amateur, designing as my whims take me. That means many of my creations use unusual mechanics and I'm prone to exploring concepts that would be difficult to market.<br/>
<br/>
I warn you now, catch me in the right mood and I can be rather wordy, but I always try to include something helpful somewhere in there.                        </div>

                            Well, I only started reading this thread to see what I might have written about myself two years ago, but seems like I haven't written anything. You see, the last few years I have been in "retreat", kind of. Been living a very quiet life with my two children and my wife, and almost no social life outside the family.<br/><br/>As I write this post, I believe it is a sign I'm easing out of my retreat. Hope so.<br/><br/>I'm a 45 year old Norwegian, author, storyteller, poet and gamesmith. Have written both traditional rpg's and others, a lot of them, since 1986. <i><b>Fabula </b></i>is one of the traditional ones. <i><b>Muu </b></i>is traditional in system, but avant-garde in theme (was, when it came in 1990). <i><b>Pervo </b></i>is notorious (rightly so) for it's enthusiastic violence and bad behaviour, and has very little system to talk of (but is traditional through and through). <i><b>Livets Høst</b></i> (Autumn of Life) is a more recent design, and the one I'm most proud of. It is not traditional, neither in method nor in theme (it's about old people dying and reminiscencing).<br/><br/>My last design was a a game in a series building on my experiences with Livets Høst, called <i><b>Løpe fra døden</b></i> (Running from Death). The series is planned to consist of nine contemporary rpg's for grown ups. I also wrote a new "roleplayingpoem" called <i><b>Jesus loves you</b></i> last weekend, a strange title for a game written by a man who reads the bible as fantasy. It's a simple game about caring and salvation and happiness.<br/><br/><i><b>Roleplayingpoems </b></i>are my invention, by the way. Read more about it in the blog: <a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow"><b>Norwegian Style</b></a> ( a couple of my minor games are posted there, in English). To write rpg-poems is a great way to experiment with method and theme, and gives you the chance to get instant feedback on your design (most gamers have 15 minutes to spare for a new game). And it's fun! We made 13 such poems last weekend, and played them all. Try it out!<br/><br/>OK, that was me crawling out of my shell, kind of. I hope to write many roleplaying games in the future.<br/><br/>Have a nice day!                        </div>

                            Hello!<br/>
<br/>
I'm Dana Johnson.<br/>
<br/>
I'm female, I was born in 1970, and I starting playing RPGs in 1981 with the blue-book <i>Basic D&amp;D</i> set (first game used chits in styrofoam cups!) along with my brother.  Moldy old favorites include <i>Classic Traveller</i>, <i>RuneQuest</i>, <i>Call of Cthulhu</i>, <i>Pendragon</i>, <i>Over the Edge</i>, and <i>Champions</i> (yes, I have a copy of <i>Strike Force</i>).  More recent systems of interest include <i>Unknown Armies</i>, <i>HeroQuest</i>, <i>Sorcerer</i>, <i>Burning Wheel</i>, <i>The Riddle of Steel</i>, <i>Wild Talents</i> and <i>Seven Leagues</i>.<br/>
<br/>
I just got <i>Thousand Suns</i> and it put a smile on my face, although really it should be black with a little red stripe on the cover, for maximum verisimilitude.<br/>
<br/>
I've lived in 9 states and I have a degree in math/physics, but I do computer goobery for money.  I live in the frozen tundra of Minnesota, and have lurked around various RPG newsgroups/mailing lists/forums for a long time, usually as either AnyaTheBlue or more recently UnlikelyLass, or some variation of both.  I tend to lurk more than post, though -- I tend to be 'bursty'.<br/>
<br/>
I like to draw.  I do not fight crime.<br/>
<br/>
Hm.  Anybody else feel like they're writing a personal add when they write these things?                        </div>

                            Hi, I'm Keith aka the new guy...<br/>
<br/>
Once upon a time in the early 70s, I went with my father into his favorite hobby store to pick up a small (5.5X8.5) rules booklet about this new game based on one he already played... That was my first exposure to RPGs.<br/>
<br/>
Outside of that, I've tried to lead a full life. I'm a few hours shy (as well as thesis defense) of a doctorate in biomedical engineering. I'm going to stay that few hours shy for a long time - I burnt out on school and decided to become a professional chef. I've also done quite a few different things to pay the bills: graphic design, programming, sales... So my current "job" of being a stay-home dad isn't exactly unwelcome at this juncture. ;)<br/>
<br/>
I have a rather untraditional family - but since this be teh intarweb I won't speak of them further except to say that a family that games together stays together.<br/>
<br/>
Sex, Religion and Politics are subjects I won't get into. Unless you start talking to me in person... and then it might happen. Might.<br/>
<br/>
I'm originally from Indianapolis, so I know a number of great places off the beaten track within walking/spitting distance of GenCon. Currently, though, I live in sunny Lake County IL - an equal drive to Lake Geneva WI and downtown Chicago... which also speaks volumes about me as well.<br/>
<br/>
Top 5 Movies: Thank You For Smoking, SLC Punk, Velvet Goldmine, Sin City, Shawshank Redemption<br/>
"Top" 5 Bands/Musicians: Leonard Cohen, Current 93, Claude Challe, Morphine, Angelo Badalamenti<br/>
Top 5 Comics (mostly dead): The Invisibles, Planetary, Transmetropolitan, Books of Magic/Hunter, 1602<br/>
"Top" 5 Authors: Chris Hyatt, Mantak Chia, Neal Stephenson, Charles Stross, JG Ballard<br/>
<br/>
TV: the rest of the family are reality addicts, but I have problems in seeing human tragedy as entertainment. We tend to like watching shows on DVD rather than as broadcast. I have a love of Yo Gabba Gabba, Charlie and Lola, and a number of other kids shows.<br/>
<br/>
Radio: umm, what's that? ;)<br/>
<br/>
I can't think of anything else to add at this moment...                        </div>

                            It’s been some months since I signed in, but, as they say, “better late than sorry”.<br/><br/>[Or was it “better him than never”?]<br/><br/>I began role-playing at the age of 12 or 13. I had already been exposed to non-rpg <i>D&amp;D</i> derivatives, like the computer game <i>Wizardry</i> on the <i>Apple ][</i> (a pure dungeon crawling game) and <i>Fighting Fantasy</i> gamebooks (I think it was <i>Deathtrap Dungeon</i>), or films like <i>E.T.</i> (although I did not understand what I saw, it unavoidably primed me). I put the pieces together I lifted the resolution system and general ideas from the <i>Fighting Fantasy</i> book, built a ridiculous dungeon on a piece of paper, invented some (pathetic) characters and got some friends on a rainy afternoon to run it. It was a semi-disaster, but I was hooked. Next I got <i>D&amp;D</i>, a friend got <i>Dark Eye</i>. Then <i>AD&amp;D</i>. Next came <i>Call of Cthulhu</i>, <i>Warhammer FRPG</i>, <i>Runequest</i>, <i>Star Wars</i>… and that was just the start.<br/><br/>These last years I became more and more tired with published rpg and periodicals. I progressively stopped buying them, quietly slid of the mainstream rpg universe and stopped paying attention to rpg-related news. But never stopped playing or mastering. I attended LARPs (Belgian style) 3 to 5 times a year during 3 or 4 years, then stopped because the novelty quickly wore off to reveal the monotony.<br/><br/>By accident I very recently discovered Indie games, story games. I regret I missed them at the start and I am trying to catch up.<br/><br/>That’s it.<br/><br/>Oh, yeah: Ajax isn’t my real name.                        </div>

                            My name is Frederik Jensen and I spend way too much time on the net :-)<br/>
<br/>
I'm a Dane, born in Denmark, living in Denmark and I only fight crime in my imagination. It is usually very peaceful around here, except when young fanatics set fire to people's cars and when the police shoots criminals on the corner.<br/>
<br/>
By now I'm an avid story gamer, meaining I really enjoy getting rid of the all mighty GM and have everyone sit around the table on equal terms and make up great stories on the fly about complex situations. I believe in story games as a great way of gaining understanding and empathy about how other people perceive the world. I'm always amazed when people around me show me that the world is not as plain and simple as I have made myself believe.<br/>
<br/>
I'm a software architect in the day time in a great company. <br/>
<br/>
At night I play games, read and post on story games, and work on my hobby project: The story game Montsegur 1244. I spend my weekends at my summer house, where I also do game weekends for close friends a couple of times a year. And then sometimes I go to game conventions and help set up games, workshops and other fun stuff.<br/>
<br/>
My roleplaying history begins with "choose your own adventure", then on to Dungeons and Dragons (red basic set), Drager og Dæmoner (that Sweedish stuff), AD&amp;D, AD&amp;D 2, Call, GURPS, Star Wars, Torg, and then away from traditional sim game systems and into Danish style, one-shoots scenarios. Passing over Ars Magica, WFRPG and later D&amp;D 3, before finally discovering story games like Dogs, Roach, PTA and latest Bliss Stage.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I still have many gaming years ahead of me, as I'm nowhere near having played all the great games out there.<br/>

I'm Craig J. Brain. I'm a 38 yo gamer posted to Canberra, Australia, but working overseas at the moment. I've been gaming since about 1978, and have since  had a couple of goes at publishing and editing products on the indy side of the house.<br/>
<br/>
I prefer sci-fi gaming, and love post apocalyptic settings, but also love some of the older games such as DragonQuest and Traveller. I have just picked up Spirit of the Century and am new to story games. BTW I like SoTC, but have only played a single game of it for an hour.<br/>
<br/>
Warmest regards,<br/>

Like most people I'm always 'working on a game' although I'm trying to make the push to get my latest effort out there.<br/>
<br/>
I live in Oxford, England with my girlfriend of 6 years, have graduated from Essex University with a Computer Science degree and I'm currently programming computer games for a living, which is nice.<br/>

                            I'm Dave Kneeland and I am 29. I've been gaming on and off for around 17 years but lost touch with it terribly in the last 8 years or so. I've just recently reconnected with an old gaming buddy which sparked my interest.<br/>
<br/>
I am a Residential Services Supervisor for a Children's Home in Maine.<br/>
<br/>
I cut my teeth on 2nd Edition Dungeons and Dragons, and have played many different games in between now and then. My main interest lately has lead me to GURPS as I have started thinking about creating my own game world.                        </div>

                            I'm Kristian and recently turned 33. Like a few other people I just scrolled past, I'm a Canadian living in Seattle, and I'll be married later this summer. <br/>
<br/>
I work at the UW in the fisheries department, which lends itself nicely to lunchtime trips to Half Price Books, Zanadu Comics, and if I feel like braving the bad part of The Ave, The Dreaming (Comics and Games). I have lived in Thunder Bay ON, Calgary AB, and Ames IA before chasing the woman of my dreams to the west coast.<br/>
<br/>
I hadn't thought about my first gaming experience for many years, but it came to my head the other day, and I'm sure some of you may get a chuckle out of it, so I'll share:<br/>
<br/>
I was about five or six years old and had a nine or ten year old DM showing me the ropes. I made a character that had a sword, a dog, and a horse. My character was riding happily along when a group of men stopped me. I tried to fight the lead man and remember cutting off a limb or two before the other men stopped me from killing him. They just wanted to give me a new horse and dog because the ones I had were 'bad' somehow. So after that, with my 'better' animal companions, I ventured into a cave. My dog and I ventured into a room with a door that closed behind us. Out came a group of giant rats that started to swarm us and very quickly overcame my trusty companion. I think I managed to kill a handful of the foul beasts before being overrun and killed.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't touch a roleplaying game again for the next 15 or so years.<br/>
<br/>
After figuring out that ten year old GMs aren't the best you can get, I've gotten back into gaming and am having a blast. I'm currently playing in a Reign and D&amp;D Eberron campaign, and running WFRP.                        </div>

                            Hey there. I'm Rachel Walton. I'm 27. Born in California, grew up in New Jersey (which I staunchly defend against all the haters), and now live just west of Philadelphia. I went to Houghton College in western NY and double majored in History and Art (ceramics). I've been married to xenomouse (but I call him Phil - you can too) for 5 years. No kids yet, but we do have two cats and two chinchillas. I work a Trader Joe's. You're welcome to talk to me about our cool products outside of work, but if you come up to me randomly to complain about TJs, expect a dirty look. And a sucker punch. It's rude. <br/>
<br/>
I'm slowly working towards becoming a potter professionally. I do both artsy hand-built pieces and functional wheel-thrown stuff. I'm currently working on mastering the tricky one-piece goblet.<br/>
<br/>
My interests are pretty broad. Gardening, cooking, camping, reading, and just hanging out top the non-gaming list. I love horse-back riding and fencing as well, but I've not had the pleasure of either in quite some time. I like a lot of different music, but I'm almost always in the mood for NIN or anything by Chris Cornell (of Audioslave and Soundgarden fame - his solo stuff rocks too). "The Departed" is the best movie ever. My favorite current shows are LOST and Battlestar Galactica. Favorite authors right now include Kurt Vonnegut, Ursula K. LeGuin, and Donald Miller. <br/>
<br/>
I first started RPGs with 2nd Ed D&amp;D in highschool, but long before that, I was the creative mastermind behind many detailed play-worlds for my friends and I, from vampires, to lion hunters, to underground drug gangs with little baggies of cocaine, er...flour (yeah, I wasn't a typical 9 year old). When we discovered ElfQuest, we loved it so much that we created our own club for it, reading comics, constructing forts, and playing elves. <br/>
<br/>
I GMed for the first time in college. Last year I introduced a whole new group to D&amp;D which we eventually converted to Burning Wheel. BW is the meat and potatoes of my gaming right now. I love it. So I run a weekly BW game for 9, because I'm insane, and I play other games when I can. Other games I've recently enjoyed include In a Wicked Age, Ganakogok, The Mountain Witch, and Dresden Files.                        </div>

                            I can't believe I haven't filled this in before now!<br/>
<br/>
My name is Neil, I'm 37 and I live with my wife, two kids and a d6 cats in North Shields which is near Newcastle in the north east of England. Newcastle is officially 'too far away from anywhere else to be useful' and 'legendarily freezing cold' - neither of which is wholly true. For years I have been known online as Vodkashok (its a B5 reference...honest) but I am starting to rehabilitate myself into using my real name more because ... well, I'm an adult. My name will do!<br/>
<br/>
I have an honours degree in Marketing Management and I am currently retraining to be an adult educator. When I first started work I worked as a warden in a hostel for homeless people trying to settle into housing - probabtioners, children leaving care, mental health patients in the community. Oh what fun! I decided to leave that job when I was shot at one too many times and began work with an organisation that helps homeless teenagers develop independence skills. That was fun until the stress of it all started to bite. Since then I have worked for Newcastle Uni Students Union as their education researcher, their student development officer and finally their Marketing Manager. My job entails a whole slew of random tasks - research, promotion, graphic design, printing and usually everything else that no-one else can be bothered to do. Its fun, but after 13 years I really REALLY need a new job.<br/>
<br/>
My wife, Christine, is an adult educator and assessor and she used to run her own IT training company. She is an inspiration to me because she has never stopped learning throughout her life and now, well, she is like a walking qualification and damned good at what she does. Lara, my eldest (10) and Emma, the youngest (8) are both little dynamos, currently obsessed with Dr Who. One of my 'must-do' things this year is to get back roleplaying with them, as their adventures with A Faerys Tale last year were Epic! The cats are ... well, maleable. We have one, officially, and then two more that use the house as a hotel and two more that seem to like to see how far the official one, Sammy, lets them in. I'm convinced that he has parties in the house when we aren't in. He's that sort of cat.<br/>
<br/>
As for my non-gaming pursuits? Well, I've got about 12,000 comic books in my loft and I've been collecting them for decades now. I'm a team book addict so its all Avengers, JLA, JSA etc. as well as a load of random crap. I love the wacky world of professional wrestling and I've been to Wrestlemania now four times (Seattle, New York, Los Angeles and Chicago). In my time I have been known to do a lot of cooking, but not so much recently and a fair bit of comics fanfic writing - again, not so much recently. Apart from those and gaming, work and the girls, I don't really have much time for anything else! Well, I do watch TV - Heroes, BSG, Pushing Daisies and Dr Who are the mainstays at the moment although I do seem to be developing an addiction to Deadliest Catch which is disturbing. Oh and football, of course. Watching Newcastle Utd - its like flaggelation of the soul. I read quite a lot as well, but nothing spectacular. A lot of history books at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
Gaming wise I have an excellent community of gamers around the North East. We number around a dozen and between us, in various combinations, we have two rpg groups, a board games group and a WoW guild. Its very much a sort of 30-somethings self help group with academics, accountants, computer geeks, engineers and all manner of other people involved. Very good stuff. Over the years I have also ran a number of CCG communities both within the UK and worldwide and that network of gamers still exists, which offers another outlet for gaming and geekdom through a community that I maintain.<br/>
<br/>
Currently I am going through the final motions of my game of Napoleonic adventure, Duty &amp; Honour, playing in a truly excellent game of Primetime Adventures and preparing for a storygamed-up 4e campaign when it comes out.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

                            I'm Grant Davis. I'm 35 for one more month. I live in Houston, TX with my girlfriend of 6 years. I work for an aerospace firm in software. Right now I'm working on the space side and I find it very rewarding. I have a Master's in Computer Science and I'm making rumblings about a second one in Finance. I like disco (yeah, I said it), though I don't get out dancing these days. I listen more than I read; Moby Dick is slowly emerging though the CD player in my car. I dabble in the Japanese language and media. Mostly I'm about the gaming, though, and I can talk about that elsewhere.                        </div>

                            I'm somewhat solicitous of my privacy online, at least to the extent of mentioning my name - so I'll omit that bit.<br>
<br>
I live in New York, not far from NYC proper. I recently completed a master's degree in developmental biology (doing research in a breast cancer laboratory at Hunter), and I'm currently paddling water while I take some undergrad courses I need in order to apply to dental school. I'm also keenly wishing I were rich so I could just blow off professional school and pursue PhD after PhD for the rest of my life; I'm currently eying environmental science and astrobiology and epidemiology. Just to get started. I would've gone to med school, but sadly I echo Bruce Baugh in living with massive immune problems - a residency program would have ended me.<br>
<br>
Been RPing since I was about nine, having been introduced to a homebrew/drift of DnD2e. From there I went White Wolf for a while, just in time for some of those awkward teen years; eventually I grew despondent over the sickening social chaos that tended to follow RPG groups and gave up the hobby. I found the Forge in the latter years of college, and while I've never found anyone to play with them, I've surely grown very fond of reading the games that've come out of there.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Hullo. <br/>
<br/>
My name is Adam Riemenschneider. I live in Shoreview, MN, which is a northern suburb of the Twin Cities (although I still consider myself a Minneapolis resident *in spirit*). I'm 32 years old, and am an indie game publisher (www.othercourt.com). I work in a luggage shop mostly full-time, and am a lead bartender at the only Goth/Industrial club in Minneapolis, Ground Zero. I attended college for many years, but stopped short of graduating; English Major, Creative Writing Minor. I am also a musician, performing the functions of lead vocalist, bass, and song writing (though I find playing bass and singing lead vocals at the same time to be nigh impossible). <br/>
<br/>
I like motorcycle, knives, and firearms. I was raised Roman Catholic, but am an Atheist. In my life, I've been a bouncer, a library desk clerk, a payroll accountant (for the Sheriff's office, no less), a home security dispatcher, a customer service rep, and a delivery driver. I like Libertarian ideals, but think there ought to be a sort of safety net which the government provides. I dislike the Big Brother society that America is becoming, and hope that things get better, instead of getting worse. I am addicted to coffee. <br/>
<br/>
I've played RPGs for about twenty years. Really, I'm a "vanilla" gamer... I prefer traditional RPGs a majority of the time, but like board and story games now and then, to fill the gaps in scheduling and whatnot. I've been a Forge member for a little while, but not long enough to say I fully understand GNS Theory. They haven't lynched me for it, so I guess it's all good. <br/>
<br/>
That's about it.                        </div>

                            My name is Jonathan, but everybody calls me "Jono".  I'm 28 and just moved from Chicago to Mountain View, CA (it's in Silicon Valley) to work for Mozilla.  I'm searching for a new gaming group in my area.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.evilbrainjono.net/cgi-bin/blog/showblog.cgi" rel="nofollow">I have a blog</a>, frequently updated with stuff about gaming but also politics, computers, comics, adventures, et cetera.  I occasionally draw a webcomic called <a>Yuki Hoshigawa and the Scariest Thing in the World</a>; it's a sort of shojo-cyberpunk-office comedy.  It's been several months since I last updated it, but I hope to fix that soon.<br/><br/>Before Mozilla, I was a computer programmer for a four-person startup software company in Chicago called Humanized; before that I was a research assistant at Argonne National Laboratory, and before that I taught English to junior-high school kids in the mountains of rural Japan.  I speak Japanese pretty OK and I like a lot of anime and manga, although the obsessiveness of American otaku-fandom culture scares me.<br/><br/>I was a Physics major in college.  I have a tattoo of Maxwell's electromagnetic field equations on my right shoulder.<br/><br/>I'm just getting back into Aikido after several months away from it; I've been doing it pretty seriously since fall 2000.<br/><br/>I volunteer for the Obama campaign.<br/><br/>I'm friends with Ben Lehman in real life; I met Paul Czege briefly at Forge Midwest in 2007; I might know more people here, but not know that I know them.  Hello!<br/><br/>When I was thirteen I saw some high-school boys playing AD&amp;D 1st edition in the cafeteria; they wouldn't let me join but I watched enough to get the basic idea of what they were doing, then went home and immediately created my first RPG, which I called "Master Plan".  Inspired by equal parts Lord of the Rings, the Legend of Zelda, Phantasy Star, the dungeon-crawl board game "Hero Quest", my brief glimpses of what the D&amp;D players were doing, and my own deranged imagination, it was a very, very silly game.  100% Gamist; early version even had Save Points in them.  Japanese console RPGs have Save Points, I reasoned, so why shouldn't my game? I played it with my cousins; the two PCs were a slime-monster wizard named Globble D. Gleep and a dragon who rode around on a piece of magitech construction equipment.  They were on a quest to save the world from an evil corporation full of undead real-estate salesmen and undead lawyers, who could only be killed by Holy Hydrosulfuric Acid.  The game used lots of d12s and mostly revolved around intricate dungeon maps full of traps and logic puzzles.  The campaign fell apart right as they were assaulting the flying death-ray airship fortress.<br/><br/>After that:  basic D&amp;D (Rules Cyclopedia style), miscellaneous Palladium games, AD&amp;D2 (a lot of messing around with the Spelljammer and Planescape settings; boy they were cool but I had no idea how to run adventures in them); a little Rifts, a little Shadowrun, more homebrew systems where I never quite got the campaign off the ground because I was much too obsessed with trying to create The Perfect Rule System; a few really horrible failed attempts to play GURPS, absolute failure at running Call of Cthulhu, a couple sessions of Vampire that were pretty OK, some attempts to adapt Planescape to D&amp;D3 which went pretty well all things considered, and then an absolutely disastrous D&amp;D homebrew-setting game which was so bad that the first and only session permanently destroyed friendships and convinced me I had to reconsider everything I thought I knew about GMing.  Almost played Exalted but walked out during character creation; a Google search for the phrase "Exalted Sucks" in the winter of 2006/07 led me to the Blog Diaspora and thence to The Forge, which completely blew my mind.<br/><br/>Since then, I've played Dogs in the Vineyard, Trollbabe, Shock, Bliss Stage, The Mountain Witch, The Shadow of Yesterday, 1001 Nights (once), Hero Quest ( the Glorantha one this time) and some playtests of several unfinished games including, most recently, The Emperor's Heart -- and loved them all!  For the first time since Master Plan, gaming is fun and satisfying again, rather than frustrating.<br/><br/>Nice to meet you.  (I wish English had a better equivalent to "Yoroshiku onegai shimasu...")                        </div>

                            Um. I don't think I've ever done this before, so here goes?<br/><br/>My name is Anna Kreider, but I tend to use this alias out of habit. I'm 26, have been married for almost six years. Two years ago I relocated from the United States to Canada and have been enjoying Canadian communism ever since. (I have to say that, since the nice mountie has a gun pointed at my head.) I have a bad habit of being sarcastic with a completely straight face, which sometimes gets me into trouble but is terribly amusing none the less.<br/><br/>I went to school for five years to get a Bachelor of Fine Arts in photography so that I could enjoy a very boring career as a medical secretary. Filling out forms in quintuplicate has been very motivational to get myself out there, and I've had a number of freelance projects including illustration for a few games, some portraiture, and web design. I'm also releasing a game at GenCon this year, much to my chagrin because I have to finally admit that I might actually be a game designer. <br/><br/>It is my fondest hope to some day NOT work in a Dilbert strip, but for now I put up with it because it motivates me to be productive.<br/><br/>I'm hopelessly addicted to RPGs, especially any RPG made by Squaresoft. I used to be addicted to Dark Age of Camelot before I kicked the habit, but am realistic enough to admit that I am just saving myself for Warhammer Online. My husband and I have a board game addiction and have an entire closet full of excellent games that I don't play enough. Also, I'm a gigantic movie buff.<br/><br/>I lurk on the Forge and post intermittently over on Knife Fight. And... uh... that's about it.                        </div>

                            Hey all,<br/><br/>I'm new. My name's Dave, I'm 26, and I'm a Japanese - English translator currently living in Yokohama. Contrary to what that might make you think, I hate anime and manga. <br/><br/>What I love is RPGs, particularly Dungeons and Dragons, believe it or not. I started off with Basic D&amp;D, moved onto 2nd edition AD&amp;D, then after a long extended detour through the World of Darkness and then various more "worthy" games I realised that I got the most satisfaction out of 2nd edition AD&amp;D and went back to that. I do occasionally foray into MERP and HARP, though, and recently I've been playing a bit of Homebrew ORE and getting somewhat excited about it. But 2nd edition AD&amp;D mixed with a bit of BECMI D&amp;D is home to me. <br/><br/>I write a <a href="http://monstersandmanuals.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">blog</a>, like most people do. <br/><br/>Nice to meet you all.                        </div>

                            Hi, I'm Ben, and I'm a gamer. [Hi, Ben.]<br/><br/>I'm 34, and I was born and raised in New York, and currently live on Long Island. I listen to very loud music and play way too many computer games. I probably watch too much TV. I've been playing RPGs since about 1988, and can't get enough of them (I had a bit of a hiatus for about 6 years, but I've jumped back in and started 2 new groups that are running concurrently now).<br/><br/>The short answer is that I've been doing artwork &amp; character sheets for games  for about 8 years now (The longer version goes on to state that I've been doing character sheets for as long as I've been gaming, but I've only been getting paid for it since 2000 or so). Some of my stuff has made it into games written by Ron Edwards, Clinton R. Nixon, Jared Sorensen, Paul Czege, and Brennan Taylor. I'm currently working on adding Luke Crane to that list.<br/><br/>-- Ben Morgan<br/>ad1066@optonline.net<br/><a href="http://ad1066.deviantart.com/" rel="nofollow">http://ad1066.deviantart.com/</a><br/><a href="http://www.spookybeans.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.spookybeans.com/</a> </div>

                            Hello there.<br/>
<br/>
My name's Anders Bohlin, I'm 26 and I live in Piteå, Sweden. My plan is to become a music teacher so I've spent the last six years studying (more or less...). Before that I was a conscript in the Swedish Navy for 11 months and somehow managed to only get on a boat three or four times in total (I was with the Naval Control so my primary duty was to sit in front of a computer and hit F9 to clear new and unnecessary messages from our surveilance software).<br/>
<br/>
During summers I have the privilege to work as a guide and musician in a church that was built in the early 1200s. It's been updated every now and then until the the late 18th century so it's full of things that were fashionable at their own time. Somehow it all comes together very nicely. Even though I'm mostly into old rock and psychedelia and such, I spend my summers singing renaissance and medieval music. It's great fun and great music.<br/>
<br/>
I've been roleplaying steadily since the middle of the '90s. I was first introduced by a friend of a friend and later my cousins in the early '90s. At that time roleplaying was viewed as pretty dangerous in Sweden - there'd been a lot of negative media coverage and the Swedish game Kult (Kult: Beyond the Veil now with French 7th Circle) was more or less the thing that removed RPGs from toystores and such. Hence my first gaming product was a fantasy bestiary, the "Monster Box", for 'Drakar och Demoner' (originally a translation of RuneQuest, more or less stripped of setting). At least three times I promised my mom that it wasn't a roleplaying game in it self. "I just want it for the art!" I said. And... that was kinda true. It had some great art... but naturally we used it to play anyway. Some d6 got to replace the d20 from the original (gosh, I created GURPS by myself!!).<br/>
<br/>
A few years later I visited London and found RuneQuest Deluxe (RQ3 boxed set) in a second hand store that otherwise only had clothes. Naturally I got it, and played it with my friends and... after that I've been in it. And mom's no longer worried. ;D<br/>
<br/>
What about now then? Well... 2007 really blew me away. It started with a con game in January that was just magical which really set the tone for the whole year - I was hungry for more. So when Easter came I went to Gothenburg (a 20 hour trainride) to attend Sweden's biggest con. There I got to play an off the cuff game of Dead of Night and... yeah... something just clicked. We had an awesome session in 3½ hours including prep time. Quite different from the Blue Rose game I'd run at a local con a month earlier where I spent more than 3½ hours on just writing up the characters. I was hooked. <br/>
<br/>
During '07 I also got to play a short campaing using TSOY, 1001 Nights, some Swedish indie RPGs and of course my own creation. A special mention about the Panty Explosion campaign I was in too: we started in June and played 17 session in the main campaign and a 4 session spin-off during the course of ten months. And man... despite everything being over IRC and text only, it was awesome. Our group is very spread out so the internet is the only way for us to game together regularly and it's been working terrific. And of course, we've started a new campaing. :)<br/>
<br/>
All in all, that year made gaming so much better for me so... huzzah for dirty hippie games. I'm a wanna-be hippie anyway so, I guess it's just natural.<br/>
<br/>
Uh... yeah. So as you can tell, I don't know where to stop so I'll do it right here.                        </div>

                            My name's Timothy, and I work as a librarian in Queensland, Australia. I'm 35, and married. My wife and I met in the library.  She was taking out some sci fi novels (this is back before she joined the library) and I was cheeky to her and told her she had them in the wrong order, and she argued back that publication order's not the right order according to the author, because the new ones were prequels and things just went from there. She saw how much I enjoyed my work and changed careers, so she's now a library assistant. She's a gamer of the hack and slash computery school.  For our engagement present I bought her the collector's bound edition of "Dragons of Autumn Twilight" and we hope the Hickmans will sign it at Gen Con this year.  We have no children. We have two cats, named after the witches in "Wicked", one of who is trying to fall asleep on my arm as I type.<br/><br/>I first gamed using the Fighting Fantasy Paperbacks, then Red Box D&amp;D in primary school. I'm more of an Ars Magica gamer, although I played a lot of Amber and Pendragon in Uni.  I write a fair bit of Ars Magica as my main hobby.  I have a history degree and I find the difficult and intricate research fascinating.  It is a bit tricky to source material from Australia, but electronic document delivery is coming on in leaps and bounds, which makes it easier.<br/><br/>Other than that I cook (vegetarian), read, fool about on the web and play tremendous and ridiculous amounts of Gal Civ, where I try to limit myself to the prohibitions in the Geneva Convention to make the game tougher.                        </div>

                            My name is Franck Michaux, 36 years old and I live in Connecticut. I was born in Paris and English isn't natural for me so please be patient. I work as a programmer and hope to fit into American corporate life. I married a lovely New Englander two years ago and we're about to have our second offspring around December. <br/>
<br/>
I started RPGs when I was twelve with the obvious Basic D&amp;D which kept my friends and I amused a year or so. Then we fortunately discovered the prolific French RPGs scene whose many games entertained us and, I believe, made us better people too. I was a play tester sometimes. A few American games mad it through too, like Amber. Though I regret the time when I was a careless student who could spend dozens of hours playing this or that every week, at some point I got lured into other activities like free parties and whatnot. I didn't play much after the nineties. I didn't analyze this shift then but I must admit that I had probably reached a limit in the type of fun I could experience with RPGs. Or maybe I just needed a break. Would I have known about story games back then it could have changed things.<br/>
<br/>
My knowledge of new forms of RPG is only through websites, forums and podcasts. I wish I could find a group of players interested in experimentations, still looking for it. I'm a bit afraid of how difficult it might be for me to play in English but I'm not terrorized either. I miss role playing fun a lot now.                        </div>

                            I'm Rp Bowman.<br/>
<br/>
I'm a 37-year-old Hispanic-Caucasian Male with weight problems and money problems. My wife weeps to see how I dress on a daily basis and I'm also very grumpy.<br/>
<br/>
I live in Colorado Springs, CO with my wife and a whole bunch of debt.  I've always wanted to self-publish, but I have always made the choice to pursue other responsibilities before indulging in this bit of vanity. Well, okay, I helped my wife with her Happy Childhood zine and put out a few minor games through that method, including the trashcan edition of Panels years and years ago.  I even won a minor award for game design, but that's about it.<br/>
<br/>
I've worked for the County off and on for years and I'm a grumpy, fat, greasy truck or courier (in a Hawaiian shirt) driver when I'm not doing that (meaning I'm gone from home for long periods, every now and then.) I regularly volunteer for the wrong political party and work as an election judge for... someone else's precinct on the other side of town, usually. I try to dislike all genders, races, ages, classes and sexual orientations with equal disdain, but sometimes one of these horrid groups gets past my guard and I find myself charmed.<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to get a story games group going with someone else on this site, but we're the only two people in town really showing any interest.<br/>
<br/>
I used to be pretty good at comedy and horror games, but whether I still am or not, I love to GM. I like games with a level of cute that sickens a lot of players and I hate bragging. That makes me a very poor salesman. <br/>
<br/>
My wife likes old Italian horror movies (especially anything with Paul Naschy) and sundry horror comics, so that tends to seep into my games a lot. She's also a freelance event planner, so I get to make up party games for her niftier projects every now and then.<br/>
<br/>
My favorite games of all time are Prime Time Adventures, Castle Falkenstein, Paranoia, Teenagers from Outer Space and a couple of different board games I won't go into here. In general I avoid any game with strong doses of amnesia, gothic angst or military glory.<br/>
<br/>
I'm also unreasonable fond of the BBC series, Doctor Who (and its spin-off, The Sarah Jane Adventures.)                        </div>

                            I'm Kawa. I'm 19, currently going to college in Central Florida (Florida Institute of Technology) getting my degree in applied mathematics. I'm originally from New York City though, so you can imagine the culture shock! Anyway, I started gaming when I made my way down here, starting with in an insane D&amp;D Modern game where I met my future fiance, best friend, fellow player, and chef. ^^ My favorite systems so far have been BESM 3rd Edition and D&amp;D 4E. I care for said boyfriend, five lovely fish (a male and female betta and three Schwartzi corydoras), and various dying plants, including one not-dead-yet well-beloved orchid. My 'day job' (if you can call it that) is doing research; using mathematical models to understand ecology (population dynamics). I also love music (I participate in the music ministry at my local Catholic parish, as well as the college a cappella group), football in the European sense (I'm currently typing this while watching the nail-biting wonder of the Turkey vs. Germany Euro Cup game) and food (well, figuring out what tasty things I can eat despite my severe poultry allergy).                        </div>

 A Native Philadelphian, I have recently turned 21 and am not quite happy with my job in video gaming retail. Hopefully I will be attending the Art Institute the winter and I am the owner of two wonderful cats.<br/>

My experience with gaming is very limited and only extends to D&amp;D and the OWoD games of Vampire, Hunter and Changeling and a bit of Exalted. I'm terrifically excited for the new Hunter, I want the new Changeling something fierce (Stupid paychecks not being enough). Scion I am completely enamored with and I am irritated that I can't really find anyone in relative closeness to  play with.<br/>

Other hobbies besides playing table top games include, drawing, amateur voice acting, trying to figure out Macromedia flash.                        </div>

                            I'm Daniela, born 1974 in Temuco/Chile, living since 1975 in Germany (my German parents had to go back these times).<br/>
I recently moved to Oldenburg (very north of Germany) from Stuttgart, to get a new job as a professor for database and internet technologies there.<br/>
<br/>
I started my rpg career quite late (age 23) and quite unusual. My first five games within my first year were Pendragon, Starwars, a self-built space odyssey campaign, Immortal, and Dendarii D6, playing in the Vorkosigan universe by the books of Lois McMaster Bujold -- who happens to be my favorite author -- with Starwars rules. Later we switched to TriStat and finally to GURPS. Since then, I played (both sides of 'the screen') around 40 different games.<br/>
I love to try out games. But even more, I love good stories, and I hate it when game mechanics get in the way of a good story.<br/>
<br/>
Before 2001, my favorite game was Mage: the Ascension. I considered the system quite unintrusive, loved the flexible and creativity-driven magic system, and, as a GM, avoided many fights because of the not-so-flexible conflict system.<br/>
<br/>
Then came Engel. It's a German rpg in a post-acopalyptic SciFi-Setting (though the characters think, it's mythical), and it comes with D20 system (only for selling purpose, don't try this at home) and the Arkana, which is based on inspiration cards. This changed my way of role-playing. Dramatically.<br/>
Arkana isn't too different from the Everway tarot cards, however, they did two major changes: first, they tailored the motives and words to the settting, and secondly, the player now explains what happens, based on the card.<br/>
Suddenly, I loved conflicts and epic battles, even as a GM. And I realized that these inspiration cards give me everything I need in a game.<br/>
<br/>
So, I still try out new games, particulary fresh new indie ideas. I even support and promote them (if my time allows it). <br/>
<br/>
But for my personal rpg fun, I'm through with dice.                        </div>

                            Wow, this is a long thread.<br/><br/>So. Introductions. I'm Laurent Castellucci, 36.  I actually got my start gaming with D&amp;D - before there was basic and advanced. It was a box with a dragon on the cover, facing off with a Knight and a Wizard. My parents picked it up, thinking it looked interesting. I had no one to play with, so I ran my sister and my dad through adventures. (Incidentally, since he had read <i>Chanson de Roland </i> he played the best Paladin I've ever seen.<br/><br/>I've played my share of games. (Lots of the old 80s classics) and then moved on. I keep drifting back.  A few years ago I found HeroQuest while looking for a new system (and had briefly dabbled with The Window). I loved the idea of it, and after encountering Mike Holmes on the Forge (while looking for more) I liked his take on it more and more, even if it meant sometimes beating on the system to try and get it to do things I wanted. (I am hoping for better from HQ 2.0, but the little I've heard makes me think all it will do is be a little easier to try and shift around.) <br/><br/>A disastrous love life and job situation of late put me off gaming, but now I'm working in PR, being underpaid, but at least can entertain the thought of indulging again. (Hell, I even have someone running an Amber game I will join, and am going to give running a game using HQ another try, since I can't be bothered to wait for HQ2.0 - I'll just warn them I might shift the rules slightly on them as I go.)<br/><br/>I sometimes act and write, used to dance and do some stand up, and just got back from The Dark Knight, which is a really good film.                        </div>

                            I'm Ryan. I live in Fresno, CA. I have a BA in Cinema from San Francisco State, but I work as a file clerk. It's boring, but extremely easy, and pays the bills. <br/><br/>I started off playing <i>Vampire: The Masquerade</i>, a decade ago, in high school. After playing a few sessions, I switched to running them. I've been playing ever since. I GM about 90% of the time, as I find running the games much more enjoyable then playing them. <br/><br/>I'm currently playing <i>Spirit of the Century</i>. We've played three or four sessions, and I estimate we will complete the campaign in about two or three more sessions. We'll be switching to <i>Burning Whee</i>l after that, with the intention of making that our more-or-less permanent campaign. I've been building the world in my head for a while now, and I'm pretty excited about it. <br/><br/>I stumbled on this site through the Forge, I think. Or, possibly, through a podcast. Probably Sons of Kryos, or Theory from the Closet. I'm honestly not sure. I found the Forge through the <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> website, which I found through RPG.net <i>DitV</i> got me interested in Indie games, which I hadn't known existed until I found <i>Dogs</i>. I ran a couple of Dogs one-shots, then went back to my Iron Kingdoms game, which uses the D20 rules. I was never fond of D20, even on the best of days. Finally, after three or four really boring sessions, I killed the game, decided I was done with D20 for good, and went on hiatus to find a game worth playing. Now, we've got a new group going, with one player who has never played an RPG before, and another who hasn't in years, as well as the two veterans from my previous campaign. Everything is going smoothly right now, and that makes me very happy. <br/><br/>I am kind of working on a game of my own, called <i>Last Girls</i>. It is a competitive role-playing game, with an emphasis on Gamist, Story-Now play. It is basically intended to be a simulation of a slasher movie, and should take about two to three hours to play, depending on how much the players socialize. I am aiming for it to be a zero-, or almost zero-, prep game, with a very shallow learning curve. It's just in the notes stage at the moment, but we'll see.<br/>By the way, a Last Girl, in horror film criticism, is the last person (typically a woman, hence the name) alive at the end of the movie. Typically, she is the first to die in the sequel.                        </div>

                            Wow, this thread is pretty long... and frankly, at parts, intimidating!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm Christine. I'm 21, and live in New York City. I'm going to be a senior in college in the fall, and my double major is English and Communication and Media Studies. I've set up my career path so I'm able to get my dream job once I'm out - as an children's literature editor at one of the major publishing houses. As far as marital status goes, I'm currently involved in a very long-term relationship, which will eventually lead to bigger and better things.<br/>
<br/>
As for gaming and such... I've never played a tabletop RPG. I've played loads of console and PC-based RPGs, but never one that was actually pen and paper. As a result, I've always been intrigued by them, but I quite literally have no one to play with. Therefore, I have lots of questions about mechanics and little nitpicky things, many of which I think I'll address on the forum.<br/>
<br/>
I went to Dexcon 11, my first convention, a couple of weeks ago, and it was loads of fun. Since I didn't preregister, and I could only go on Saturday, all of the events I initially wanted were taken (including a DnD4e game which ended up to be canceled anyway). I enjoy video games and board and card games as well. I guess my nature is inherently playful.<br/>

<br/>
I've been playing RPGs since I was 10. I'm a collector and a game-hacker with about 200 RPGs on my shelves and house rules for just about all of them. I live half-way between Ottawa and Montreal. I've run a dozen or so RPG fansites, and published my first non-fan product at the end of 2001 (a d20 supplement). I won an ENnie award for my third book that summer at GenCon, and now my wife runs the awards. I owned Ambient Inc's RPG publishing wing, and E.N. Publishing. Now I am a marketing director for an on-line school and I play games purely for enjoyment. <br/>
<br/>
Well, I'm also working on a few RPGs in the background, but nothing due to be published for another year or so.                        </div>

<br/>
I'm Danielle, most famous for being the spouse of Paul Czege. Paul got me into gaming about 7 years ago and we've been playing and attending cons ever since. I grew up in Metro Detroit and live in the same frikken town. I am an architectural historian by profession (more emphasis on the history than the architecture) and have been working for the city of Detroit for 9 very long years. I like puzzle games and board games and people won't play trivia games with me anymore (head full of useless stuff). I am an avid online comic reader, buy lots of indie comics and I try to draw my own comic/blog, lemonwedge.net (but I don't think its running yet).  I have 2 cats (much to the chagrin of Paul) and all of my relatives live out of state :-D                        </div>

<br/>
  My name is Tom Russell.  I'm a 35 yo programmer living and work in Eastern MA.  I do a fair amount of gaming and I've got a number of designs that I'm tinkering with.  I don't know why it's taken me so long to get an account here -- probably the fragmentation of the scene.  <br/>
<br/>
  Currently, I'm playing in a D&amp;D game with my wife and a Dark Heresy game with some other folks.                        </div>

<p>Hi everyone, I'm Andrew Brehaut, a 25 y/o software developer in Hamilton, New Zealand. For my day job I build share market related software using Django and Python. I am engaged to a lovely non-gaming girl who works as a speech and language therapist.</p>
<p>My main gaming fix since moving up here comes from a D&amp;D3.5 game i have joined, and a Dont Rest Your Head PBeM game i am running with some of my old group. I started out gaming with 'First Quest' for AD&amp;D 2e but quickly moved to Palladium Fantasy revised and then Rifts. After a 5 year break from gaming i picked up GURPS (Discworld and 4e) and CoC, and then I discovered story games through Have Games Will Travel. SotC / FATE has captured part of my brain and wont let go. I'm currently rereading SotC, and making my way through Burning Empires and Trail of Cthulhu.</p>
<p>Other interests include guitar, design, learning haskell / functional programming, and a scifi/fantasy.</p>

                            I'm James "Yasha" Cunningham, a 47 year old native Seattleite.  I am happily married with zero kids and one cat.<br/>
<br/>
I have been unemployed for a few months.  I am currently pursuing parallel career-counseling and neurological goals which will result (hopefully) in my being able to harness my brilliance and creativity for the benefit of humanity (although humanity will probably never realize that it has been benefited).<br/>
<br/>
I am currently obsessed with the American Crow, which has an intelligence rivaling that of the great apes.  The crows in my neighborhood know me by sight because I occasionally give them peanuts as I walk by.  In my more deluded moments, I entertain a scheme to jumpstart the natural language abilities of crows through peanuts and live music.<br/>
<br/>
When I post to message boards, I always seem to bring threads to a halt.<br/>
<br/>
I speak Esperanto and am intending to learn Toki Pona, a 118-word language that a French Canadian woman invented to cure her depression.<br/>
<br/>
Matt Wilson is mad at me.  Please tell him that I was only joking.<br/>
<br/>
My most spiritual moments have involved sound and music, so I pursue musical interests despite the fact that I seem to have little talent.  I own many musical instruments, none of which I play very well.  Sometimes I sit back and play my Electric Wind Instrument through a Filter Eko II (a Uruguayan looper pedal) into an guitar amp, and create wonderful, horrible noise.  I am interested in microtonality and sound design, and intend to write liturgical music for a ritual that I experienced in a dream (a Mass for the New Moon).<br/>
<br/>
At times, I am the Mystery Chef, living in my orbiting test kitchen and recording radio spots for my sponsor, The Gas Company.  Only my wife is able to see through this disguise.                        </div>

                            I'm Joshua James Hoade, but I am most definitely a Josh.  I'm 32 years old, but most people peg me at about half that.  I'm divorced and I have two daughters, high ladies of chaos, the both of them.  I have a B.A. in english/lit, but neither a master's degree or teaching were appealing to me, so I went back to school for respiratory therapy.  I work at Miami Children's Hospital as a ward secretary.  I should be finished with school late 2008 after which I will most likely trade my telephone and keyboard for a suction catheter and aerosol mask.  This will be a good day.  Outside of gaming, I enjoy writing and reading, football, basketball, rollerblading, movies, and more TV than might be healthy.  I love comics.  Love em.  <br/>
<br/>
I started gaming at thirteen.  The D&amp;D red box.  I still remember the art in that book, I loved it.  From D&amp;D I moved to robotech, TMNT, Shadowrun, and west end Star Wars.  Around high school, I stopped.  No gaming group and more other stuff to do.  Fortunately, in college I met Daniel Perez.  He introduced me to Vampire: The Masquerade and I was back in the fold.  I've been gaming with the same group now since '02, and no matter what I say about them, they're great guys and great gamers.  People join, personalities clash, we fight, leave, make up, come back.  One day we'll have a reunion, and it'll be like the Avengers Reassembled, (take that Bendis!)  We've been all up and down the genre spectrum playing mostly D20 and D10 world of darkness.  One year I hope to drag them all out to Gencon so that they can feel the awesome.  <br/>
<br/>
Now I find myself here looking to discuss the hobby I love.                        </div>

                            I'm Scott Oden (I know, snappy screen name, huh?), a long-time lurker but first-time poster.  I'm 41, divorced, no kids, no cats (alas), but I harbor a wicked love for parentheticals.  I've been a gamer for three decades; my gateway drug was the D&amp;D red box.  From there, I moved on to Traveller, Call of Cthulhu, TSR's Conan (now ZEFERS), d20/OGL, and -- most recently -- Dark Heresy and In a Wicked Age.  I've become quite taken with games that have more emphasis on character and story rather than number-crunching and mechanics, but I've had a hard time translating that interest to my gaming group -- a hardcore bunch of twinks and min/maxers.  I hope to find inspiration on these boards.<br/>
<br/>
I'm a novelist by day (and generally by night, too).  I have two historical fiction novels published in the US and the UK -- <i>Men of Bronze</i> and <i>Memnon</i> -- and I'm on the last bit of my third, <i>The Lion of Cairo</i>.  I count Robert E. Howard and Harold Lamb as my greatest influences, followed by Tolkien, Mary Renault, and Steven Pressfield.  When not writing or gaming I can generally be found with my nose in a book.  Or playing video games.  Or slacking.<br/>
<br/>
I have a website and a blog, but not the technical savvy to make the links show up here.  My website is www.menofbronze.com ; there's a link on it for the blog.  Be warned: I have a weird thing for Orcs . . .                        </div>

                            I'm Eric Tage Larsen.  I'm a 38 y.o. designer and illustrator in Manhattan.<br><br>I've lived in New York for the past 13 years but prior to that I'd lived all over the West, Mid-West and California.  I'm a graduate form the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena.  Since then graduation I've had work in Print magazine's Design Annual, Society of Illustrators and American Illustration.  For a decade, I was an American Painting and Sculpture specialist for a major New York gallery. (Tangentially, I'm one of the first people to write on the outsider artist Henry Darger and only found out recently that i'd made it on to the wiki.)  A couple of years ago, I decided to take my moonlighting more seriously and go out on my own.<br><br>I started gaming in the early 80s.  I was fortunate enough to not only have a group of latchkey friends that would play DnD around the clock, but I lived near a great gaming store in Minneapolis that opened me up to a wide variety of play.  I've only returned to gaming in earnest in the past few years.  I think working from home, alone, has probably spurred my interest in gaming - for its enforced social contract.<br/><br/>Indy-Story Games are also very new to me.  I really bit into the raw sociological examination that seems to be going on the exploration of new games.  I find that it fulfills very similar investigations i found in fine art and design.  Currently, i'm quietly slaving away on a few on game ideas i hope will create good play.<br/><br/>I enjoy comfortable drink, weatherly sailboats, svelte bicycles and questionable company.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>If any of you here would know me, it would be for acting as booth assistant to the IPR/Forge booth for 2008 at Gencon.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Heya all,<br/>
<br/>
I'm Veli Liikanen, a Finnish gamer. Born in 1979, married, with two little children. I reside in Mikkeli, Eastern Finland. I'm currently working in a youth reserch project, and more academic grunt-work possibly awaits me in the future. Aside from gaming, I'm into environmental NGOs and football (as in soccer).<br/>
<br/>
Tabletop rpgs have been a major hobby of mine since 1990 or so. Nowadays I try to play with my friends as much as possible (much of it online via Skype and Openrpg and whatnot), but I also spend decent amount of time just checking out the scene, online. We've been playing indie and story-games stuff for (maybe) a couple years now, and I've felt that I've become more and more interested all the time. So now (or couple of weeks ago) I signed up on this board. Pleased to be here.<br/>
<br/>
I've also participated in some <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.altgames.org/" rel="nofollow">game-blogging</a> with my friends, time permitting (usually it doesn't).                        </div>

                            My name is Antti Kirjavainen. I'm 31 (for about two more weeks). I live in Helsinki, Finland with my wife, two cats and a room-mate. Right now, I sit bored in an office with the title "software designer". Actually I work as a consultant in a software maintenance project dealing with work insurances. I used to study games (mostly of the video game variety) at the University of Jyväskylä (Finland). I still plan to complete my Ph.D. there as a sort of a hobby project.<br/>
<br/>
I've been involved with amateur theatre for quite a while now, mostly directing and handling stuff of the stage. I've also got a degree in applied drama. I write a <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.altgames.org/" rel="nofollow">blog</a> about games with two of my friends, vellu (from the previous post) is one of my collaborators.<br/>
<br/>
I'm a football (soccer) fan, I follow the premier league and the adventures of the eagle owls, the Finnish national team. I also make infrequent appearances on our company's firm league soccer team. I tend to get occasional strange cravings to watch NBA basketball. I consume tons of fiction, in the form of tv series, comics, prose and drama.<br/>
<br/>
Enough about me, who are you?                        </div>

                            While this thread is at the top and I won't be involved in any resurection, I'll add my details. I'm Richard Campbell and I have been reading and playing games for 27 years. That seems like a long, long time now. I started with the Erol Otus covered Basic D&amp;D and went through many, many systems trying to find one that did what I wanted it to do. Some of the ones I have fond memories of include Other Suns (I still love the way all future people will wear flares or tuck their leg-wear into their boots), Space Opera (long lists and tables), Chivalry and Sorcery, Daredevil, Justice Inc., Aftermath and Bunnies and Burrows. One of my best RPG moments was playing Bunnies and Burrows semi-LARP around my friend's smallholding. I had a bit of a thing for FGU games even though I never really understood them. It's not until recently that I found the indie/narrative thing and thought, THIS is the way I always wanted it to be!<br/>
<br/>
By day I am a reception (kindergarten?) teacher in England and reception teachers all have a 'role-play' area in our classrooms - all over England! All children use this term every day when they go to school! OK, it's not quite the same - but surprisingly, often there is a lot of what you might call 'role-playing' just as gamers would understand it going on in classrooms. We just obviously get to the point it's not the done thing any more and then we all become geeks. I also write music (in amateur-land) and keep cats and rats and I'm looking to do something more creative with my time, hopefully combining my educational 'expertise' and interest in gaming. Hopefully.                        </div>

                            Since the thread is fresh, I'll take a moment to post as well. I'm 34 and live in Clayton, NC, which is just southeast of Raleigh. My wife, dog, cat, and I moved down from Baltimore last year. I do system and application administration to feed my stomach and draw to feed my soul. Santa bought me red box D&amp;D when I was a kid, but Dad couldn't figure out the rules, so I just looked at the pictures. And that was pretty much the extent of my non-video gaming. <br/>
<br/>
This past year out of the total social vacuum of living in a new state I visited my FLGS and let myself be talked into trying D&amp;D. The pictures had changed since the red box, and the game was entertaining enough, but I thought I might be a little late to the party. <br/>
<br/>
I started consuming podcasts and blogs to learn about this hobby I'd only tangentially touched from other interests. For the past year I've been playing vicariously by listening to everyone else play and talk about play. Since I started listening about a year ago, all talk was about Gen Con. It seemed to be something of an experience, so I went this past month. I got to meet several of the podcasters and talk to some of you designers and even played a game or two. It was enough to make me want to explore a little more.<br/>
<br/>
I signed up here to consume even more and keep my eye out for events and people in the area and perhaps...perhaps even actually play one of these days...perhaps. It's great to see the names of so many of those I've listened to, or heard interviews with, or read about. I feel like I just snuck backstage. Please don't check my badge.                        </div>

                            Hi all!  I'm new to Story Games but I know a bunch of Story Games members in real life so I figured I would become a member and join in on the online fun.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Jim Sullivan and I live in Forest Hills, Queens, NY.  I'm 30 years old.  I'm married (6 years as of last Monday) to a beautiful, wonderful person named Evelyn.<br/>
<br/>
I started gaming in my early teens, stopped in my late teens, started again in my early twenties and have been loving it ever since.  When I'm not playing games or playstorming at The Imagination Sweatshop, I can be found rock climbing, painting war game miniatures, blogging about vegan restaurants, watching low-budget science fiction movies or playing nutball (minor league only - I just can't compete with Jenskot and Saif).                        </div>

                            Hello. I've been lurking around reading Story Games and The Forge for a while, but I just had to post on a thread and so I finally joined up here.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Michelle Taylor, I'm 23 and I live in Cambridge (the real one in England!). I work as a software tester.<br/>
<br/>
I'm currently running and playing fairly conventional games IRL (I run a weekly Exalted game in a kind of 'sandbox' style that I've got to work out how to wind up soon because most of the players can't make it during term time, and play a weekly D&amp;D4 game in a post-apocalyptic FR-derived setting which the DM describes as 'a sandbox on wheels'), and I also do a lot of online forum / play by post roleplaying (I'm running a Solar Exalted game which is limping along with one or two players taking an interest at any one time, a D&amp;D4 modern-day zombie game which hasn't really got started yet, and I'm playing in a variety of D&amp;D4 / Exalted / WFRP games).<br/>
<br/>
I've also just about finished playing my first game of Bliss Stage over internet chat (also the first game I've played online via chat) courtesy of Elliott Besler, and would like to get to run a game (either in the same way, over chat whenever enough people for a scene are free, or IRL) but I'm having trouble getting together players. (I thought about leaving a link to the recruitment page but this message is likely to persist long after it's irrelevant - whisper me if you're interested.)<br/>
<br/>
I also do a lot of LARP - we have a local weekly tavern night / adventuring system which I was part of the organising team for last year (we rotate organisers in and out each year to avoid burnout and ensure new ideas) and I also go play at various national-scale events like Maelstrom and EOS. I tend to call myself an immersionist but get frustrated at the assumption that this means I want to camp authentically in the woods and wear home-made underwear - poor physrepping doesn't concern me, poor ability to stay in character does.                        </div>

                            Hi everyone.<br>
My name's Craig Irvine and I'm a 31 year old habitual gamer. I live in Middlesbrough, England and work in the wonderful world of retail. I've been in a regular game group for the last few years but been collecting games since I was a kid meaning I've got a cupboard full of RPG books. Most of them should be eBayed but I'd sooner sell a kidney.<br>
D&amp;D is still the game of choice for my group but we break up our campaigns with a bit of WoD, the odd indie game and some Paranoia.<br/>
<br/>
The rest of my life revolves around playing footie and hockey (the kind on astroturf) keeping up with the British music scene and spending too much time on RPG.net.                        </br></br></div>

                            Hi, I am Nathanael Cole, aged 28, full-time tech slave and part-time psycho-nerd.  I grew up in Mobile, Alabama, moved to Atlanta at the age of 19, and have been living in the fabulous expanse of Portland, Oregon since 2005.  There's something in the water in this town which makes it feel brand new and exciting every day that I wake up, and keeps me making tiny changes to my routine whenever possible.<br/><br/>I studied linguistics in college, but quit because I hate classrooms.  I used to speak fluent Mandarin, but about all I can do now is order at restaurants, and that's only provided the staff doesn't speak Cantonese.  I game (I refuse to believe it isn't a viable verb) way too much for my own good, and think about it perhaps throughout 60% or so of my conscious life these days.  <a href="http://nathanaelcole.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">I even frequently blog about it, among other things.</a>  I was even blessed by my parents with nerdy initials.

                            I'm Dave Wilson.  I've been a lurker for some time, registered here for a month (as of my typing this, of course).  My first RPG experience was TSR's Top Secret, given to me and my brother back when we were in high school by my mom's boss, though I don't think she had a clue what it meant.  AD&amp;D hit hard my junior year in high school, and I played through college.  Also played Star Frontiers, and a homebrew sword &amp; sorcery game written by the brother of one of our players.  Upon leaving college, I drifted away from role playing.<br/>
<br/>
20 years later I'm big into boardgames, and listening to board game podcasts, and start listening to Have Games, Will Travel.  Thanks to Paul Tevis, I get curious about RPGs again, though I find I'm pretty weary of the sword &amp; sorcery schtick.  I still haven't played a role playing game since college, but I'm hoping to get a group started playing Primetime Adventures soon.  I've owned the game for 15 months; it's about time.  I also have a coworker interested in Dirty Secrets; we'll see what becomes of that.  I'm seeing a number of other games go by that look really interesting, but I'm going to work with what I have first.<br/>
<br/>
At this point I have some interesting restrictions on my gaming:<br/>
- Week nights only.  This restricts the length of individual sessions, because I still need my sleep for work the next day.  <br/>
- Minimal prep.  <br/>
- No swords &amp; sorcery (as mentioned above).<br/>
<br/>
I'm on the west coast of the US, SF Bay Area (Tri-Valley, for those familiar).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, there you go.                        </div>

                            I'm surprised to realize that I never posted here.<br/>
<br/>
I was born in 1972, which makes me 36 as I type this. I've been happily married for four years now. My wife is a professor of education, and we have a ten year old daughter together. I got my BA in philosophy and political science, decided that working in either field professionally would be awful, and went into IT instead. Now I manage a team of UNIX SAs, which means I'm doing politics anyway. You can't escape your destiny. Somewhere along the way I decided that moving was bad, so I still live near Ann Arbor.<br/>
<br/>
I've played lots of different games, with varying levels of frustration. I played a lot of Amber in the nineties, which led me on a course from "wow this diceless thing is TOTALLY GREAT" to my current passionate dislike of the Amber DRPG system and the idea of diceless gaming in general. I was stumbling around from bad idea to bad idea when I discovered the indy / story games scene and immediately sensed that there was something there I wanted to check out.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from RPGs, my main interests are computers, airsoft, and the Eve Online MMO.                        </div>

                            Aaron Hamric<br/>
Age: 25<br/>
Sex: Mannish<br/>
Occupation: Art Student/Game Designer<br/>
Location: Lee's Summit, MO<br/>
Credits: Playtesting pretty much everything ever made by Clint Krause, including his terrible games in high school(Ask him about losing to me every time in Wrath of the Axis) . Most recently I have playtested Clint Krause and Amy Garcia's Empire of Dust, and Chris Perrin's Messiah and Mecha games.<br/>
Current Projects: Brainstorming several different delightful games with my buddies at KNRPG. http://www.knrpg.com/<br/>
<br/>
I play a little bit of everything, from D&amp;D to Wushu and everything in-between. Personal favorites include Savage Worlds, Rules Cyclopedia D&amp;D and Aces &amp; Eights. I also like to collect obscure and/or "bad" rpgs. I have in my collection, World of Synnibar, F.A.T.A.L, Fantasy Wargaming, Ghost Dog the Roleplaying Game (how's that for an obscure license?)  among many others.<br/>
When I'm not doing homework, doodling or playing video games, I'm attempting to learn guitar and write songs so that one day, my dreams of rock-stardom may come true.                        </div>

                            I realized I still hadn't posted in this thread, so I thought I, y'know, ought to.<br/><br/>Name's up there, I'm a Swedish engineer of 24 years of age (keeps rising, though). I've been hanging on the Swedish RPG site rollspel.nu for years, under the username of Genesis (I thought it was cool when I registered. Hell, it even used to be something like ".o:~Genesis~:o." ...). I'm in the process of publishing my first game, in Swedish, called Oskrivna blad (Unwritten Leaves), which is a prepless, world-building-and-then-playing-in-it game with a narrativistic bent and no GM. There's also an expansion in the works, called Historiens vingslag (something like Wings of History), where you play through the history of your game world to givve it awesome depth.<br/><br/>I've been enjoying RPGs since forever, and the indie scene since I discovered it. Been lurking on Story Games for yonks, and now I've come into the light.<br/><br/>EDIT: Also, I do kung fu, historical longsword fencing, medieval festivals, language learning, and planning on going into diving and/or hanggliding. Not enough time ...                        </div>

                            In the spirit of lurkers coming late to this thread:<br/>
<br/>
My name's Sam, and I post infrequently.  I'm 21 (for the next few days, at least), have a BA in the history of science, and work for a small non-profit in DC.  I've met and gamed with several regular posters on this board at Dreamation and Gencon over the past few years (it's an odd sensation, being introduced to someone you recognize from lurking on a forum...)<br/>
<br/>
I started playing RPGs in middle school with Shadowrun 2e.  One day I bought My Life with Master after Steve Darlington reviewed it on RPG.net and it was all downhill from there.  I own a lot of games both trad and indie (too many to fit in my current apartment...), and have played a fairly large subsection of them.  These days I game via Skype to keep in touch with my college friends.  Currently it's just D&amp;D 4e for me, though I have fantasies of starting a PBEM Burning Empires game.<br/>
<br/>
I'm new to DC, and in addition to settling in have started fiddling with electronics and (soon) learning krav maga.  I have also recently rediscovered the pleasure of reading novels for my own enjoyment, and just finished Spook Country, by William Gibson.  Next up: Living in Little Rock With Miss Little Rock, by Jack Butler.                        </div>

                            My name is Simon (or 'Si'). I'm 34 and living in the UK.<br/>
<br/>
I spent about 30 years of my life living in London, and following a brief stint in Brighton moved up to Chester with my girlfriend, where we had a boy. 4 years on and we're now moving back down to London, where we'll be having another boy. <br/>
<br/>
I'm a graphic designer, ocassional artist and writer, fan of horror, dark sci-fi and dark humour. I'm mostly into Call of Cthulhu at the moment, but am just getting into forum-based games in anticipation of leaving behind a whole bunch of gaming buddies in Chester, and not having a great deal of time to make new gaming buddies in London before settling into a routine of sleepless nights.<br/>
<br/>
Here's 20 questions answered (and slightly amended) from one of those forums:<br/>
<br/>
1.Character name? (ah, not really relevant to this site)<br/>
2.Vanilla or chocolate? Vanilla<br/>
3.Cats or dogs? Cats<br/>
4.Real name? Simon<br/>
5.Location? London, England<br/>
6.Age? 34<br/>
7.Occupation? Graphic Designer (though mostly type-setting at the moment)<br/>
8.Favourite book? Short but weird compilation The King in Yellow<br/>
9.Favourite film? Tough, tough, tough... Sometimes it's Company of Wolves, sometimes it's Natural Born Killers, although, no, recently I've loved Pan's Labyrinth.<br/>
10.Favourite type of music? I'm caught between rock, dance and jazz. I appreciate a good dancey rhythm, or clever lyrics, or something with a bit of swagger. Over the last five years I've seen a variety - Red Hot Chili Peppers (supported by James Brown!), Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Nine Inch Nails and Faithless.<br/>
11.Favourite food? It's all good... :-)<br/>
12. What’s on YOUR mug? It's a work mug. It makes clever use of the company initials (RY), to spell out recovery. With a graphic of recharging batteries (as you get on mobile phones) on the other side.<br/>
13.Tea or coffee? Coffee at work, tea at home.<br/>
14.Favourite sport? Football. In the back garden. With my son.<br/>
15.Favourite perfume/ eau de cologne? Whatever it is I'm wearing now, that smells slightly of cinnamon.<br/>
16.Favourite colour? I always like colours that contrast, so it's hard to pick one. I usually wear blacks, but like vibrant reds and deep blues.<br/>
17.Last album you bought? Dig! Lazarus, Dig! (Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds)<br/>
18.Last film you saw? Hot Fuzz.<br/>
19.Favourite comedian? Ricky Gervaise is very funny. Always used to like Bill Hicks, but I've been over-exposed. More recently I got into Dane Cook, Lewis Black, Demetri Martin and Mitch Hedberg. It's very hard to pick any one favourite.<br/>
20. How's the weather at yours NOW? Bright but cloudy.<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Or sunny. I may need to keep updating this...<br/>
<br/>
I have a cat. It's not in the same league as a dragon, but I think he needs convincing.                        </div>

                            I admire the stamina of anyone reading this far in.<br/>
<br/>
I'm Doug.  Had other names on other boards, but never posted enough that people are likely to recall them.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm 42 and have been gaming on and off since 1977.  It amazes me when I think how long that's been.  :)  Started with D&amp;D (blue box).  In the early 80's, it was AD&amp;D, a bit of Traveller, Champions and trying to make up rules for giant robots.    Now it is mostly reading, a regional con occasionally (mid NJ), and some bi-weekly D&amp;D.  I would love to get some BW/BE play in, but since I don't drive my ideal gaming locations are somewhat limited.<br/>
<br/>
Work is IT on Wall Street.  I don't think I'm evil, and I don't think Wall Street is evil.  I don't really want to hear it if you do 'cause that's usually not a productive conversation.   Sort of like arguing over which programing language is better only with even more emotional involvement for many people.  The upside of the work is it can be fascinating, and it pays well.  The downside is the general perception of Wall Street.  <br/>
<br/>
Other interests are pretty stereotypical.  Reading (history, old pulps (neo pulps much less so), fantasy, some sf), board games and cooking (especially bread).  I do a bit of carpentry very occasionally, but don't really have the patience.   No kids and no pets, neither my wife nor I are found of having dependencies we need to be responsible for.                        </div>

                            Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I’m Lou from Vancouver, Canada. 32 y/o. An avid gamer since the age of 10 or so. I found my way here through the podcasts Stabbing Contest, Independent Insurgency, and the Sons of Kryos.<br/>
<br/>
By day I repair the machines of my corporate master. There are occasions at night when I transform into a musician. <br/>
<br/>
I love gaming because it puts my thoughts in order. The world is chaos and the ability to systemize it is a great asset. By playing a scene we equip ourselves with the knowledge of what could be.<br/>
<br/>
My gaming has been stagnant lately. It seems that everybody wants to do the same thing all the time. I’ve had a bellyful of killing and looting under a vague premise. Wealth and violence aren’t the only motivations in life, right? <br/>
<br/>
There are some games I need to write. I’m always hacking and tinkering to no good end. What a waste of time. Tried Game-Chef last year but I was all over the place. Frustration seems to be an aspect these days.<br/>
<br/>
I can say with confidence that I have played HoL and Sorcerer at the same time. Hopefully this will be less disastrous but equally fun.                        </div>

                            Hey all--I've been lurking for a while now, but I recently started posting a few things, so I figured I should actually introduce myself.  I'm 36 years old.  I've a Masters in Creative Writing, and I teach English composition at two community colleges in Southern California.  I'm happily married, and we've got a little girl who I'm home with in the daytime (I often teach in the evenings).<br/>
<br/>
I enjoy reading and we've got lots of books.  I've got lots of sixties and seventies science fiction and fantasy in paperback.   I also like nineteenth century lit--particularly the Romantics and the American Renaissance writers, and I read lots of comics and graphic novels as well as lots of other pop culture stuff.<br/>
<br/>
So yeah I'm probably a fairly typical example of an English teacher (if you can see past my Clash t-shirt).<br/>
<br/>
That's All For Me<br/>

I'm Chinese American, while my wife is Jewish, which resulted in our daughter having a 5 word full name, and already all the guilt she's going to be able to handle for a lifetime. <br/>

I got interested on RPG design since oh so long ago, but never took it really seriously until a few years back, when I began studying them, reading whatever I could get my hands on that was related to RPG theory and game design in general.<br/>
I've been playing them since 92, when I bought the black box D&amp;D on a comic book shop. Some years after that I got in contact with quite a few different systems through a friend who's got a really huge collection of gaming books, but my knowledge of them was very superficial. Maybe I still know a lot less than I'd like to know of them, but having known different systems and reading John Kim's RPG design patterns, articles at The Forge, and designer's notes that were already inside the books but that I used to skip made me broaden what I think RPGs are in essence.                        </div>

                            I'm Kalle, twenty-odd years, a Finnish literature major. I'm into my fourth year in the academia and currently interested in the study of narrative, the fantastical and short story form. I also write and work as a part-time freelancer. I was introduced to roleplaying just six years ago but the obvious connections between the hobby and my other interests prompted me to get curious and later reasonably well-versed. I game rather infrequently at the moment and don't have enough time to pursue writing as much as I'd like, but I always have a project or two in the burner.<br/>

Some of my favourite games are Primetime Adventures, Zombie Cinema and Theatrix.                        </div>

                            Brad J. Murray, 43 as of this writing, and an ill-educated jack-of-all-trades. I like pretentious typographic tricks and multisyllabic words. I used to be an arrogant dick but I got better. Currently I work as a researcher in the automated transit sector, specialising in operating systems, tools, and security. I get tense when I ride a train with a driver on it. My gaming life started in 1977 or so with D&amp;D with Traveller rapidly following. I only turned hippy in the game scene around 2006 and the pendulum still swings back. I game weekly, though most sessions are design and tinkering with our current project. I am in love with one of my players' recent ideas about narrative authority context, especially his idea that there is a "table" context for authority. This is now driving our design.<br><br>I don't smoke (except a nice cigar every now and then) and I drink expensive scotch or (absurdly) rum. I have a parenthesis fetish that results from my colleague editing out my em-dashes. I am married to a wonderful woman that I lived with for 10 years first. We exchanged titanium rings in June of 2008, witnessed mostly by gamers in suits. Our games are usually ORE (Reign) or Fate (increasingly home brewed).                        </br></br></div>

I am currently a civil servant, although I've changed jobs a fair bit, and I studied History at uni (ended up with an MA, thesis on medieval history). No kids, not married (yet!), other than the UK I lived in Japan for 2-3 years, teaching English at a Japanese high school.<br/>
<br/>
Been roleplaying for ages now - 23 years give or take - and mostly play indie games these days, although the actual gaming is more sporadic lately as I'm yet to find a local group to meet up with regularly.                        </div>

                            I am Lance, and I'm shocked to find I've never replied to this thread.<br/>
<br/>
Scene Framing: Lance sits in a room just larger than 10' x 10' in a folding camping chair in front of a makeshift desk that is actually a large trunk. Scattered across the desk are various DVDs, a 30-round M-16 magazine, and two picture frames, one digital, containing pictures mostly of his wife and son, and of course his laptop. The rest of the room is subdivided by two wall-lockers, with a low bed on either side, both of them covered with army-issue poncho-liners rather than proper bedsheets. His rifle is propped up in easy reach to his right. <br/>
<br/>
Non-Gaming Interests: Absolutely nothing. I'm kind of one-dimensional like that. More seriously, I'm into reading (fantasy fiction) computers, programming, the SCA and my family. <br/>
<br/>
Life, the Universe and Everything: I'm 29, and I've been a soldier in some form pretty much my entire adult life. At this time, I am an army Staff-Sergeant, serving in Iraq, and I tend to assume that everyone knows that already, even if they don't really know me. I've been to two GenCons, the second of which was spent almost entirely in the company of indie/story/small press game designers and players, and I still feel like an outsider. I've got three games that have been "in development" since Adam turned to Eve and said "Nice going." Two of them have been in playtesting stage since the flood. I'd confess to having a problem with procrastination, but I can't be bothered to do that right now. Despite this, by tomorrow morning, I'll have finished writing my first novel.<br/>
<br/>
The most important things in my life right now are my wife (Rhonda) and my 1-year old son (Orion), whom I am sporadically watching via web-cam as I type this.                        </div>

                            My name is Raphael, 24.<br/>
<br/>
I'm from Poland, "where roleplaying games grow on trees". At least the half-finished, homebrew ones.<br/>
Oh yeah, we really love fantasy, games and stuff. Especially talking about them. We like to talk.<br/>
It's much worse with the design though. With so many self-created game designers, we should already take over the world. At least the world of table top games. But here, everything ends on a concept. I doubt that you'll find <b>one </b>game you know from Poland.<br/>
<br/>
Enough with this. Back to me.<br/>
<br/>
I am a game designer with ambitions to become second <b>Gygax</b>. Period.<br/>
So yes, I'm not a very humble person.<br/>
<br/>
I've been roleplaying since I was 10, and before that I have been creating little board games for me and my friends. Since I knew RPG I started creating my own games, one of them, my favourite project should soon see the networtk sunlight for the first time. After I finish this, nothing will stop me from creating dozens of board games, RPG's ad mixtures. And the world will finally be mine, as it should.<br/>
<br/>
Other things that I'm interested in are:<br/>
<br/>
media<br/>
commerce<br/>
psychology<br/>
theology<br/>
languages<br/>
antropology<br/>
concept art &amp; design<br/>
video games<br/>
writing<br/>
<br/>
I'm getting married in next year. And I'm doing everything to become a profesional game designer, who will earn money by doing what I really dig. And a writer. I definitely want to be a writer.                        </div>

<br>
I'm one of those people who swear by the "there is no reason to adjust my game to fit a system if I can design a system that fits the game" vow, and the games' rules have been going into more and more story focused direction of late. Gaming-wise I'm currently dividing my interest between making a coherent and enjoyable Urban Fantasy setting and getting the rules we're using for the heist campaign I'm running written to an understandable form. As far as street cred goes, been playing long (almost 20 years), designing systems for about half that time, tried to stay below the publishing radar and just keep my own gaming groups happy. <br>
<br>
Can't really remember how I found this place, but been pretty much actively lurking here all year. Just never got around to writing this post. :)                        </br></br></br></br></div>

Unsurprisingly, I take a roleplaying/acting approach, where I use questionnaires to guide my kids to create characters who <em>could</em> have lived at various epochs of Jewish history, to give them the feeling that they were actually there. I'm the cool teacher. I have no dignity whatsoever.<br><br>In life <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>, I'm a writer. I have one finished freelance job to my name (with White Wolf) and another unfinished (with Greymalkin Designs). I <em>also</em> have a blog - <a href="http://burningzeppelinexperience.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://burningzeppelinexperience.blogspot.com</a> - where I talk about writing, gaming, writing games, and the game of writing (that's pretty catchy).<br><br/>I've been roleplaying and storytelling practically since I was born. Some of my fondest, earliest memories are of "running" freeform adventure stories for my little brother as we walked our dog around and around the block. That dog got a <em>lot</em> of walking, and we saved the world more than a few times between the two of us.<br/><br/>These days I mostly run one-on-one for my girlfriend, but only because it's hard to find people to game with on a regular basis.

Who knows, maybe something will come of it.<br/><br/>ElectricPaladin is my handle pretty much everywhere.

Never one for indie gaming before ("The elitist swine can keep to their Forge-manufactured high horse"), I'm now finding that there are a fair few nice games around. Lurking here does that to you.                        </div>

                            I'm Fred, 42. A Parisian trapped in a net of unfrequent traditional-style rpg gamings that happen to please my friends. So I dwelve in US/UK forums to extinguish my thirst of game theory / peculiar designs and try my awkward english. I'm a part-time worker in several TVs network and compose and play electronic music, (Detroit style) although listening exclusively to indie and garage rock. Got a kind of rather fake phd in visual communications.<br>

                            I'm lachlan, aka lachlan99 at http://redesignmadness.wikidot.com , aka aquitane at http://aquitane.livejournal.com  I've been gaming since 1970 or so, and discovered RPGs in 1978 (the little brown books of D&amp;D and later the little black books of Traveller). Since then I've mostly played RPGs, with the occasional boardgame thrown in. I discovered The Forge and this site a few years ago, but have mostly lurked. I want to change that, which is one reason I joined the "redesign madness" challenge. Besides gaming, I also write a lot, mostly fantasy fiction, and have a fine collection of unpublished novels. <br>

                            My name is Andrew.  28 years ago i was born in the twilight of a foggy backwater world.  If there's a bright center to the universe, this was the realm it's farthest from.  Alone from an affliction of daydreaming and a strong addiction to creativity i was left mostly to myself, save when someone stranger to me witnessed one of the pages i'd been scrawling images on, intent on pestering me to find out what super-hero it was.<br/>
<br/>
I was known, in my hometown, as someone of a worthwhile imagination.  This gave my allegiance to several meta-geeks and dork lords that formed a rather impressive rebellion against the tepid lives of the midwestern kingdom that i would soon abandon.  In the ages before my sages of Gaming introduced me to strange sided dice and color images of scantily clad elven women i was merely a practitioner of the pencil and a worker of words, though never have i completed more than a short story, or finished more than a comic book page.  I came into Gaming while in training under DRDrake, Lukas Myhan, and Adam Cottingham.  And ever since i've grown away from my first loves and fallen deeply for the artform of story-games.<br/>
<br/>
Back home we have a few Nintendo's hooked up to the electric-generation-machines.  But we don't use them much; we're not Gamers like that.  And we've heard of the vast communication tools rumored to exist within an "inter-net."  But we don't much concern ourselves with that.  So, when i had come of age, the town elders gave me a sturdy mule named Betsy, and sent me away with a sacred relic of theirs:  An Apple iBook G4, capable of an impressive 12.5 minutes of battery life, when removed from it's electro-matic umbilical cord.  I took these things, and a pack of many hand-written Games, and traveled the long distance from a life of arcane adventures to the wet world of the foggy Northwest.  I came here to make coin and, when i'm not working for food, to train under the gurus listed as masters of The Forge.  I am, simply put, seeking a sifu.<br/>
<br/>
I am, by trade, a minimum wage warrior.  I've completed over 200 credit hours of college, but nobody wants to cash in my chips for a single degree.  They don't like it when you cobble together a smattering of interests instead of following a curriculum.  I drive that same mule, Betsy, a '77 Chevy Impala, though she is tired still from our journey here.  And i work now for a Reprographics company, driving a PT cruiser to various wonder-land destinations throughout the Emerald City.  And if i had interests outside of Gaming it would be unraveling the mystery of on-line forums, Playing Pretend in other useful ways, and waring with modified Nerf guns.  My fiction is Sword&amp;Sorcery, but i'm fine with good, adventurous s-f.  If i had to pick one, however, i'm not elitist enough to hang my poor head and mutter..."comic books."<br/>
<br/>
But the big mission is simple:  I want to make the world a better place.  And the only tools i've got to do that with are simple stories and Burned-CD-soundtracks.  So, finally, i'm here.  Steered to this URL by the same masters of the Gamerverse that i sought out.  And, with any luck, we'll make a world brighter than yesterday.                        </div>

<br/>
I'm Lynne, growing older by the minute, former research scientist turned college lecturer with a fairly long and eventful association with roleplaying. Current location - north east of England, warping fragile little minds in the field of biomedical science.<br/>
<br/>
I've played a variety of RPGs since I was at university, table-top and live. I've demo'd games for WOTC (Talislanta, back in the dim and distant past) and Pelgrane Press, play-tested bucket loads of stuff for several companies, written for Nightfall Games (SLA Industries, under my maiden name)  and Pelgrane (Dying Earth, under my married one). <br/>
<br/>
I also design textiles and have an alter-ego in Second Life. It is roleplaying of a kind, at least the way we do it. <br/>
<br/>
This place came highly recommended, so I thought I'd pop in and see ;)                        </div>

I'm married to a wonderful woman, some of you here know as Andi "Chicken Hut" Newton, who is a writer of horror and other squamous short stories.<br/>

I enjoy all types of gaming, but my current favorites are what I consider to be heavily narrative RPGs. If I can't throw a moral dilemma or three at my players, I must be doing something wrong.  I learned about story-games from Shane Jackson, don't hold that against me. ;-)                        </div>

                            I am a lurker, who isn't even very good at lurking. Since I never post here, I keep forgetting checking this site very often. I try to get vetter at that point, though.<br/>
I am a Swedish role-player, and thus I know of DeBracy and Simon Petterson (because, everyone in Sweden knows everyone else.) Or at least, have met them.<br/>
<br/>
At the moment, I am involved in a campaign of Mutant: Undergångens Arvtagare (Heir of Apocalypse?) and DM:ing D&amp;D4.<br/>
Other games I have played for more than one or two sessions: Eon, Drakar och Demoner, Oskrivna Blad (I think it ought to be Unwritten Pages in English, though), InSpectres, Supergänget (http://kaleidoskop.se/supercrew/) and Berättelser från Staden (http://stores.lulu.com/staden).<br/>
Games I have tried only once or twice: Best Friends, 3:16, DitV, Sorcerer, Don't rest your head, With great power... and Contenders. Since it's not that many I thought I could just as well tell you.                        </div>

                            My name is Michael Harnish. I'm 37 and am an ex-pat living in the NRW region of Germany. I grew up in upstate New York and got my B.S. in Psychology from Clarkson University. My M.S. &amp; Ph.D. are in Biological Psychology are from the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. I worked for a while in the clinical sleep medicine field (research and treatment) but got really burnt out on the stress and pace so I gave it all up and moved to Germany where I now teach psychology at the International School of Duesseldorf. I love my job and get 14 weeks of vacation a year too. :o)<br/>
<br/>
I've been gaming for more than 25 years at this point, having started on Star Frontiers, 1st edition AD&amp;D, and red box D&amp;D. I went nearly a decade without any face-to-face RPing (I played largely via PBeM and forums) but in the past couple years have finally assembled a good group that meets a couple times per month. I also still run games online via Fantasy Grounds 2 software which is a great way to meet and play with people around the world. Nowadays most of my gaming involves indie and small-press RPGs although I do run a weekly 4E game for the kids at the after-school gaming club I run.<br/>
<br/>
In the past couple years I've finally started working on some ideas for RPGs I've had floating around in the back of my head for a while: I hope to publish Kidz (a RPG about meddlesome kids, mysteries, and adventure) in 2009 and have two other games (Desperate Measures &amp; Behind the Music) currently in development.                        </div>

                            Hm. I'm going to be honest, here.<br/>
I'm Alex Davis, but I rarely use my real name online. I'm 19 and live in Rhode Island, where I've lived all my life.<br/>
I'm probably the closest here to a "negative gamer stereotype". I'm neurotic, have almost no friends or acquaintances, and continue to run and cater to a gaming group I don't particularly enjoy because I'm desperate for some form of social interaction.<br/>
It is not all down, though. I'm going to a local technical college for an Information Technology Associates, and possibly a Bachelors. I don't particularly enjoy the school, but I do enjoy working with computers (particularly programming, which I've done on and off for a while), so hopefully I'll get a job doing that after school.<br/>
Currently I'm employed at a convenience store; it's not particularly good because between the pay rate and lack of working hours, I usually barely pay tuition. I'm looking for a better job, but lack of transportation makes that difficult.<br/>
<br/>
Religion-wise I am... well, I don't really have a name for it. It's a bastardized form of Christianity, though. I don't really believe in organized religion.<br/>
Politically... I'd say "disillusioned", maybe? I don't trust any politician or government. I guess the best way to describe me is a lazy anarchist / jaded dreamer.<br/>
<br/>
My gaming history... A friend introduced me to Magic: The Gathering some 6 or 7 years ago, now. I began going to M:TG tournaments at a local game store, then was enticed by the owner of the store to join an ongoing DnD game.<br/>
<br/>
It was horrible. I kept going because I liked the idea of roleplaying, and I liked a few of the people (maybe 3 out of 20).<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, the DM of that game (a pretty decent guy, even if I didn't like the game he ran) left to serve in Iraq. He left the game in the hands of his "protege" (in reality just a friend of his) who rarely showed up, showed up intoxicated to the point of being unable to run a coherent game, and ran horrible games even when sober. Eventually he just stopped showing up, so my friend started running a game. It was awesomely silly.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually the original DM returned from his tour of duty, and my friend was unable to continue DMing at the store... The owner felt that he no longer needed "amateurs" when the Original had returned. So we brought it home.<br/>
<br/>
Since then, I've played in a variety of D&amp;D campaigns and an occasional World of Darkness game. I've run D&amp;D and Exalted campaigns, and have attempted to run other games to a variety of effects... Unfortunately, most of my players don't seem to have a great interest in RPGs as anything other than "Show up/Play a game/Goof Off/Have fun"... Probably in what might be called "Beer &amp; Pretzels" gaming, except they aren't old enough to drink (most of them). That's fine for them, and I don't mind it as something to do, but I must admit I would like a little bit more... My idea is to run a sort of low-commitment/pickup game of D&amp;D as well as a game running closer to my tastes, but I've been having trouble finding players.<br/>
<br/>
I personally have an interest in Indie Games / Forge Games / Story Games, as well as RPG theory and discussions. I've begun to work on designing games, but I find it difficult to commit without support / people to bounce my ideas off of. I've toyed with the idea of finding new players. However almost all of the gamers I've found online are in very traditional D&amp;D/WW mindsets (If anyone reading this knows of any people/groups in RI, let me know please). I'd try to introduce other people to RPGs, but... I don't really know any other people.<br/>
<br/>
Outside of RPGs, I listen to a pretty wide variety of music (Alternative Rock, some Punk, Indie, Folk, Light Rock, Hip Hop [both "real" Hip Hop and Nerdcore, but not much mainstream or what's on the radio], and a bit of other things depending on mood) and read a wide variety of books (History [I'm fascinated by the Russian Revolution and the Three Kingdoms period], Historical Fiction &amp; Alternate History, Spy Fiction [Occasionally. I need to read more.], Young Adult Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Sci-Fi, Graphic Novels, and whatever else looks interesting at the time).<br/>
<br/>
I don't watch many movies, as I find the idea of watching movies alone to be depressing. I do watch TV, particularly Burn Notice, The Shield (when it was on. I miss it), Sons of Anarchy, occasionally food and travel shows, and the rare anime.<br/>
<br/>
I used to enjoy playing with legos, but find I don't have much time to dig through my pieces and do much lately. I play video games, but I'm definitely not a hardcore gamer. I play Magic, but only casually from time to time. I'm interested in learning how to play music, but I'm too broke to afford any sort of instrument right now. I mess around with GIMP image manipulation from time to time, and occasionally make custom character sheets for games. I love reading the internet, especially if I'm finding out random might-be-true facts. I like to read blogs (esp. gaming blogs, but others on occasion), and I've got two of my own. I write crappy poetry and read good poetry.<br/>
<br/>
I don't smoke, drink, or do any drugs and I don't intend to. Even prescription &amp; over the counter medicines give me the willies. I was a Boy Scout for 9 years, and I'm an Eagle Scout. I try to take that pretty seriously in how I act and think, in terms of honesty, loyalty, respect, and general decency.<br/>
<br/>
I could go on. If anyone's curious about me, just whisper me or something and ask.<br/>
Goodnight, all.                        </div>

I have been roleplaying since I was a teenager back in the 80's. I am not a game designer, excepting a prototype card game about house sharing, which plays quite well but never ends. I am interested in roleplaying design, but I am a rubbish GM, so stand no chance of getting anywhere with this.<br/>

I am currently writing up my thesis in, river flood simulation. This thread is one of my many displacement activities.<br/>

Other displacement activities include the Palestinian cause. In fact the reason for writing this biog now is to put out an appeal for people to support Gazan aid efforts, without spamming the main threads with non-gaming material. These people have just been through some serious shit, and emergency relief will save lives.<br/>

There are many organizations working on the ground including the red cross, red cresent, human relief foundation, care, interpal, human appeal. Interpal are based in Manchester, UK and their website is http://www.interpal.info/                        </div>

                            Hi there folks<br/>
<br/>
I'm Rune B Reinås from Trondheim, located in the middle of Norway. I'm 33 years old and have had roleplaying games as one of my main hobbies for about 20 of them. I have a teacher and special pedagogue education, and currently work with children and young people with learning disabilities as well as physical disabilities. I also work some evenings helping run youth clubs in the area, where I teach band, gamemaster roleplaying games and run other activities.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to rpg's I enjoy lots of other "geeky" hobbies such as miniature wargaming (40k), comics, and literature as well as my other main hobby which is music (both as a collector as well as playing the drums myself). I'm interested in, collect, and listen to almost all rock and metal related music as well as some jazz, fusion and classical music. My main interest however is in progressive, fusion and technical rock and metal from the 70 and up to the present. I try to get to as many concerts and festivals as I can each year.<br/>
<br/>
I have a special interest in collecting Scandinavian rpg's especially Swedish games (as the Swedish market has been the biggest in Scandinavia). <br/>
<br/>
Usually I get in a couple of rpg sessions each week, and are currently running a campaing in "Drakar och Demoner Trudvang" (a fantasy setting with a strong Nordic and gritty feel) and Mutant (a Swedish post-apocalypse meets "The Wind In The Willows" game). As well as being a player in a Earthdawn and Dark Heresy campaing.<br/>
<br/>
Recently my group had it's first encounter with Indie-rpg's as we played a session of 3:16 and enjoyed it immensely. I have since ordered a few more indie games that I'm very eager to play. <br/>
<br/>
I look forward to contributing, and learning from the veterans here.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers <br/>

                            Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
I'm James, 21 years of age, from here and there.  I grew up in North Haven, Connecticut, a boring wee suburb.  My first exposure to role-playing games was "Secret of the Silver Blades", a giant-pixel computer game based on AD&amp;D.  I actually first played D&amp;D when I was, perhaps, 15.  My neighbour had a friend who DM'd a campaign for a while.  I remember playing a Centaur Druid.  I have a bit of nostalgia for the old AD&amp;D rules, it must be said, and particularly the illustrations and flavour text the manuals used to have.  I remember one disaster of a birthday party when I invited over ten friends or so, most of whom had never played, to try the special play-as-dragons supplement.  When my regular DM showed up he was horrified that I was asking HIM to run the session (but agreed to).  We spent most of the party trying to explain the rules, and played through maybe one encounter.  Not many people had a good time.  I felt embarassed because a girl I had a crush on was obviously HATING it.<br/>
<br/>
A friend (either at that party or later) got me the Players' Handbook, v3.0, for a prezzie.  I absorbed the rules and before long was ready to run a session.  I ran one with the guy who got me the book and his wee brar.  I was going to run another at a friend's youth group (he was a Unitarian Universalist), but ended up getting into a fight with his youth group leader after he was picking on one of the girls there.  I think he later got sacked, good riddance.  I eventually ran a series of games with another friend, Chris, and his younger brother and friends.  I even got my own brother to play the odd session as a dwarf fighter.  Chris' younger brother was playing the barbarian, which I have called the "little brother class" for obvious reasons.  My great triumph in this period was a dungeon crawl in which I drew a map of every room on paper, complete with grey shading for stone floors and little illustrations in various parts.  It taught me the eternal value of props!<br/>
<br/>
I didn't do a ton of gaming in high school, just time to time, but I was definitely hooked.  After graduating from high school, I went to St Andrews University in Scotland.  I was originally studying medieval history (I LIKE KNIGHTS!) and international relations (I LIKE POLITICS!) but dropped both (I HATE MY DEPARTMENTS!) to study anthropology.  I won't go into the details, but that degree fell apart due a combination of undergraduate hedonism, constant gaming, and student activism.  In my second year of uni (okay, I'll go into some of the details), I lived with a magnificent ever-so-English (don't ask me what that means) fellow named Dave, who is currently finishing up his history degree.  He was easy to convert to role-playing, and we both ran fun little campaigns that year.  I also started experimenting with designing my own game, resulting in a project to create an Arthurian RPG that has gone through half a dozen permutations and is still ongoing.<br/>
<br/>
In my third year I lived with half a dozen other people in what can only be termed student accommodation turned hippy commune.  Once again, no details, but you can guess why my degree started suffering.  But I did get a lot of gaming done.  I remember when a few of us were starting up, fiddling around with character sheets, and my flatmate Harry walked into the room.<br/>
<br/>
"Are you guys playing (snicker) DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS?" he gloated, with a huge grin.<br/>
"Yes, Harry, we are.  Would you like to play?" I responded calmly.<br/>
(long pause)<br/>
"...Could I?"<br/>
<br/>
Harry's a theatre/improv buff so he took to it like a fish to water.  I give myself credit for his addiction.  He, in turn, turned me onto a lot of the online gaming forums and blogs I now follow.  We started to take games very very seriously.  I ran a campaign called "The Green Isles" that year, in which the players essentially became pirates zooming around an archipellago, getting in drunken fights (mostly with each other), and interfering in politics without really thinking through the consequences.  The style was mostly due to the HUGE size of the group, which probably reached 10 people in one or two sessions.<br/>
<br/>
The next semester, in my fourth year, I salvaged what was left of my degree, ran an abortive "Goblins" campaign (high rate of player absenteeism, not many sessions) and got the hell out of St Andrews.  As I've posted somewhere else on the interwobs, dividing up the dice bag was one of the saddest moments of my leaving.<br/>
<br/>
I'm now at the University of Melbourne studying a Masters of Teaching in Humanities and History, so I guess even lazy students can make good.  I found a gaming group before I even landed in Australia, and thoroughly enjoyed the first session.  I'm working through a few ideas before launching my own campaign.  In gaming, I would like to explore FUDGE, Call of Cthulhu, role-play and simulation in classroom learning, and of course some day finish my Arthurian game.  After D&amp;D, my favourite game is Stalin's Story, though I don't recommend it if you have interpersonal shit going on in your gaming group.                        </div>

                            I'm Gregory. A hick from a factory town out in the mountains of North Carolina, was ripped from my little piece of the world to Great Lakes Illinois. Now a Fireman in the Navy, awaiting orders. I got bored, and got back into roleplaying. I remember when I was a kid, I would make up little adventures to play with my sister. I only knew the rules of DnD from watching the tutorial on their website, and I didn't have anything but D6's. I was a better DM back then. <br/>
<br/>
Few dudes want to play with me in my barracks, so I mostly just create things. Dungeons for Labyrinth Lord, some weird Gurps thing where the players wander about a cave complex and are attacked by monsters created from their memories, and a TON of stuff for the Princes' Kingdom, which is now officially my fave RPG ever. It's a huge beautiful campaign lovingly crafted from the folklore from my native Africa and Japan. Oh yeah, I was born in the Congo and am part of the Kusu tribe. Don't bother Googling, we're tiny. <br/>

I have been gaming most of my life but am new to the story gaming scene. Several of my Nerdnyc friends convinced me to give it a go and I am really enjoying myself. <br/>
<br/>
I went to college for music and still play several instruments including the bassoon, bari sax and piano. I also enjoy sailing, hiking the greenbelt trails, cooking and following my Metsies.                        </div>

                            Hi, everyone.  I'm Julie Lower.  Some of you know me as "Jeff's wife from the Sons of Kryos [gaming podcast]."  Others might know me as "that really tall chick."  Or perhaps both.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway.  I'm 29 years old.  I live in the People's Republic of Ithaca, NY ("10 square miles surrounded by reality"), home of Cornell University and lots of hippies, wineries, gorges, and water.  OK, it's Middle Earth.  This is my hometown.  I have lived here for almost all of my life, other than the six years I spent in Phoenix AZ, Fort Jackson, SC, and Fort Polk, LA (yes, four of those years were on active duty in the United States Army and no, I didn't go to Iraq).  <br/>
<br/>
I am a Registered Nurse in our local emergency department.  It is the coolest job in the entire world.  Incidentally, I went on a ride-along with our ambulance company, and asked the driver (who had been a paramedic for about 5 years) when he eventually got tired of "running hot," e.g., with the lights and the sirens.  He turned around, smiled, and said, "never."  Exactly.  Everyone's been speaking about spirituality on this forum so I will share this: the reason I became a nurse is because I see being exempt from Iraq as a gift from God, and this is my repayment.<br/>
<br/>
I am currently getting my Masters of Science in Nursing online through the evil cyborg company University of Phoenix.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of gaming, I started in a local LARP at 16, where I met my awesome husband, Jeff, on the very first weekend.  He was an elf named Arnon "Tree" Drader, and I was an NPC orc.  It was love at first sight.  He beat me down with foam swords and we've been together ever since.  My very favorite role-playing game is Primetime Adventures, although I also like Cat, 1001 Nights, Dogs in the Vineyard, and Polaris.  And most of the con games I've played too.  I've met some wonderful people through the indie scene.  I love going to cons like Dreamation because for a weekend, I am surrounded by the most intelligent, creative, friendly people I've ever met.  I've been to three cons total: Dreamation 2008, GenCon Indy 2008, and Dreamation 2009, and have gamed with some truly awesome people at all of them.<br/>
<br/>
Which is why I'm finally on this forum.  You guys are the best!<br/>
<br/>
-Julie                        </div>

                            I never posted on this thread? I should do that!<br/><br/>My name's Jason Godesky. I have a name amongst primitivists for <a href="http://anthropik.com" rel="nofollow">my old blog</a>, where I often wrote about the history of civilization, and why it hasn't done much good, and why rewilding would make us all happier. I won't bore you with all that; I've written enough about that on the aforementioned blog, so if you want to know how I could possibly say such things, I'll just direct you there. I met my wife, Giuli, in that context (we just tell people "we met at anarchy camp"), and we share similarly unusual aspirations for our future, which was already a hard match. Add things like her complete collection of Monty Python's Flying Circus on DVD, and you start to wonder if such a thing as fate really exists.<br/><br/>I make my living currently designing web courses for oncology nurses, from an office in Pittsburgh, PA, where I grew up. I had an intense faith in Catholicism once upon a time, but I left that behind long ago. Now, I think "animist" describes me best. I don't know if that really counts as a religion, though; my animism looks more like David Abram's phenomenology, the animism of Graham Harvey or Stephen Harding, bioregionalism, or Tim Ingold's "dwelling perspective." I don't particularly like where I find myself in life these days, but I'll accept it as a stepping stone. I want to live in the woods one day, with a small, sustainable community, and hunt, fish, gather and garden for my food. So to that end, I study things like primitive skills and permaculture.<br/><br/>But I find that the skill most commonly cited by functional native people also receives almost no attention from my fellow primitivists: the skills of keeping a community together socially, through collaborative storytelling and oral tradition. I've studied that problem a lot, and I've come to the conclusion that story games provide incredible tools for regenerating oral tradition. I have a game that I work on called <a href="http://thefifthworld.com" rel="nofollow">The Fifth World</a> that I hope will aim directly at creating that kind of tradition. I know lots of people consider my fascination with RPG's a sudden, radical departure from my older work, but I see it as just the next step on that journey.<br/><br/>I know some of the people here; Willem and Timeless, I know, come from a similar background as mine. I got to play some <em>Polaris</em> with Mr. &amp; Mrs. Teapot (unfortunately, they live on the other side of the city, so that became untenable).                        </div>

                            Hi! My name is Omar Ramirez.<br/>
<br/>
I'm 22 and was born, rised and still live in Guadalajara, Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
I've a 33 years old girlfriend with three kids (two girls 13 and 11 and a boy 9)<br/>
<br/>
I study Animation and film making at Guadalajara International University and work as a comic artist at <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://fable-ss.com" rel="nofollow">FABLE Story Studios</a> (I don't draw the current comic shown in the web page). And also teach a course on digital Illustration and photo manipulation.<br/>
<br/>
I've been into RPGs ever since I was 13 and have always been very fond of GMing. I've only recently heard the term "Story-Games" but realized I've been acting on it's principles since the very beginning.<br/>
<br/>
So yeah... Pleased to meet you all!                        </div>

                            (I guess my posting here is somewhat belated, but better late than never...)<br><br>"Dan Eison" is not just some cool alias I cooked up for the internet, it's actually my name-- I know, it's crazy, right?  I'm a recent college graduate who studied history of science for four years before realizing that I want to be a doctor.  I'm currently in a postbaccalaureate program taking all my pre-med requirements at once and pining for the days when I was allowed to write long papers about historiography instead of toiling in the hypothesis mines of lab science.  I'm a literature-junkie who takes frequent hits of theater, and I once directed a production of <i>Macbeth</i> set in the old west (my favorite part may have been designing low-budget blood-sprayers that could shoot corn syrup clear across the theater).<br><br>My college roommate (<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/account.php?u=1069" rel="nofollow">Ignotus</a> on these boards) is responsible for my headlong descent into RPGs, after inviting a callower, more innocent me to a late night session of "The Mountain Witch."  From there, it was on to "Dogs in the Vineyard," playing insane NPCs in his Cthulhu game, and my first Dreamation in 2008.  By the weekend's conclusion, I was hooked, but it wasn't until Dreamation '09 that I discovered this enclave of story-gaming, and I look forward to making your collective acquaintance.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            I thought that I had already posted to this thread, but a quick scan indicates that I haven't.<br/><br/>Hi, I'm Michael Wenman, and I'm an addict.<br/><br/>I've been roleplaying now for 20 odd years, and GMing for most of them, with over 15 years GMing at local conventions and gradually developing a number of roleplaying systems that have seen limited use in LARP settings and a few tabletop groups in the area.<br/><br/>I live in Sydney Australia with my wife (who I actually met through roleplaying), and with our dog Okami. <br/><br/>Last year (2008) at Gencon Oz, I released my second roleplaying game "The 8th Sea". The first "Platinum Storm" was released in the mid 1990s in the form that has now come to be known in certain circles as the ashcan (photocopied A3 pages stapled down the middle and folded into a 40 page A4 booklet).<br/><br/>As my facebook profile says, I'm a Taoist Christian with leanings towards Zen and Kaballah. I've spent a decade studying kenjutsu and far too long delving into patterns of human religion and consciousness. I'm hoping to tie it all together some day in a revolutionary idea that will shake the world (or at least the roleplaying community).<br/><br/>I'm always open to new ideas and new interpretations of old ideas, and I'll probably throw more than one or two ideas out there to people who might appreciate them.<br/><br/><span style="color: #FF0000;">V<br/>(and I sign virtually every entry on every forum with a red V)</span> </div>

                            Introduction time is always one of those slighty nerve wracking moments.  How does one really encapsulate who they are in a few sentences or a couple of paragraphs?  The answer - one doesn't.  But what the heck, right?  I mean lurking doesn't get anyone anything except a big collection of dead electrons and lots of pages viewed on the counters.  <br/><br/>So the basics first.  My name is Russ Matthews and I have manage to live 33 years without running afoul of a rampaging GM or jealous husband and thus getting myself deadified.  Born in Texas, raised in Mississippi and living the majority of my 20's in Atlanta, I now reside in the beautiful city of Kansas City, MO because I wanted to see what actual seasons were like.  I graduated from the Art Institute of Atlanta but not for graphic design, illustration or photography.  No, you see I couldn't do anything in a straight-line fashion so I graduated with a degree in Culinary Arts Management.  Which is rather like that degree in restaurant management that Sally Struthers used to shill on late night television, but with fancier verbage.  Naturally, since Top Chef and FoodTV have conspired to make cooking and chefwork hip, there are a hundred thousand gomers just like me out in the world trying to get a job.  Which brings me to my next paragraph.<br/><br/>As of this writing, I am splitting my time between doing freelance photography work and developing a better creative portfolio.  One of the things I do is photomanipulation work, making all new images out of stock photos.  In talking to my friend, gamera_spinning, I figure that the creative visual work that I do might find a place in the gaming industry.  So here I am, looking to make contacts (maybe even pals!) and geek out about gaming.  Like g_s, I am not a big creator of games, being happy with my position as a consumer and player of such pasttimes.  <br/><br/>For those who are interested, my portfolio site is <a href="www.russmattphoto.com" rel="nofollow">russmattphoto.com</a> and the digital manipulation section is <a href="http://www.russmattphoto.com/Special%20Projects/album/Digital%20Manipulations/index.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  If you are interested, my Flickr site is <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/eatingmywords/" rel="nofollow">here</a> and the obligatory DeviantArt account is <a href="http://arkhamrefugee.deviantart.com/" rel="nofollow">over here</a>.<br/><br/>Looking forward to reading and commenting in the future! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Hey. I'm Stephen Bretall. I live in Orange County, California. I joined the forum back in September of '08 but didn't post in this thread until now, for reasons unknown.<br/><br/>I started RPGs back at the advent of D&amp;D 3e. I've always tinkered with systems and I've actually made quite a few, but until about a year ago I wasn't ever interested in doing anything with them aside from using them myself. But I changed my mind and now here I am. <br/><br/>I'm a full time college student (for now). So yeah. That's basically it (not that it's much at all). You can fill in the rest though- I like RPGs, video games, etc. etc. I love comic books and card games, I love using minis in games that don't technically need them, although I'm not a fan of minis games without any RPG in them. <br/><br/>I'm the kind of person who would fill the rest of this post with supposedly humorous content, but I can't think of any at the moment so you'll have to settle for just this.                        </div>

                            I missed this thread earlier.<br/><br/>My name is James O'Rance and I live in Sydney, Australia. I don't recall exactly when I started playing RPGs, but my first convention was Necronomicon 95, and that was certainly a milestone. Played my first freeforms and systemless games that October, went to my first seminars, and broadened the range of games I was interested in.<br/><br/>Since then I've run a freeform campaign, designed many convention scenarios and freeforms, converted a metric boatload of Dragonlance and Planescape 2nd edition materials to third edition back when we were still calling it "3e", dabbled with freelance writing for a would-be d20 publisher (this soured me on the whole "write for money" thing, actually - it was a lot of wasted time), run a convention (once was enough), and now I'm a karaoke-loving banker who doesn't have as much time for gaming as I did when I was a student. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>I still run games (currently a fortnightly REIGN game) and produce one to three convention games per year (this used to be up to four, some of which had 30-60 characters). I play RPGs quite rarely, though. I'll be at GenCon Australia in Brisbane this year, continuing with the SF thing I've been doing at the last two Sydney conventions. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            This thread is so nice!<br/>
I still don't know if I will be posting or lurking here (lurking is more likely) but I'll introduce myself nonetheless.<br/>
<br/>
I'm Giulia, 26, now in Torino, Italy.<br/>
I've lived near Detroit for a year in ninth grade, then got back to my tiny hometown of 1600 inhabitants, 80 km from Torino.<br/>
I've moved here in 2001 to study engineering and here I stayed. I was a volounteer during the Olympics and if anyone from Vancouver is reading, let me tell you this: take part in the Games. It's an experience you will never forget.<br/>
<br/>
I'm pretty loud when voicing my opinions and quite picky in my pastimes. I found that in the end I tend to spend time with gamers, which I find to be overall more interesting, educated and smart that the average person.<br/>
My interests are quite varied and at times I fear the apartment walls will crumble under the weight of books and comics (at least, my boyfriend does - that's why we're looking for a bigger house).<br/>
<br/>
I side with ninjas in their everlasting battle against pirates.<br/>
I'm longing to own my own top-hat.                        </div>

                            Hi there,<br><br>just a quick introduction since I started my first thread. My name is Ralf Schemmann and I'm living in western Germany (Siegen). I'm a historian by training, but lucky enough to work in the game industry, mostly as General Manager for ProFantasy Software, with the occasional bit of freelance work in map-making and web design thrown in. <br><br>I've been role-playing since 1984, starting with the German standard rpg of "Das Schwarze Auge". I still play regularly (about once a week on average), partly with a group that was formed in high school and still contains several of the original members.<br><br>Recently I've been discovering the joys of indie games and have been collecting and reading what I can get my hands on.<br><br>Nice place you have here. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Hi!<br>
<br>
Been lurking long enough, so here comes a quick presentation. My name is Christoffer Lindström, live in Umeå in northen Sweden. I'm a libarian student, a relativly new father and a big fan of Morrissey (yeah! yeah!, birthday dancedancecelebration in a few days!).<br>
<br/>
Between spending time with the family, trying to become a librarian and searching for holes in the schedule to do some gaming I'm working on a small game that at the moment goes by the name Best Days of Our Lives. It's a game about bullied kids, their dreams and goals and the way towards fullfiling these dreams.<br/>
<br/>
Well, guess that's all. :)                        </br></br></br></div>

                            I'm Tom Cadorette. I'm 45, and grew up in southeastern Virginia (the buckle of the Bible Belt). I'm a copyeditor for an online financial news/investing website, but I'm not a finance geek by any stretch of the imagination. I'm also a once and future secondary-school English teacher. Liz, my beautiful crafty wife, and I live in Alexandria VA, with Sophie, our incredibly smart and cute 5-year-old daughter, and our two cats, Brutus and Max. <br/><br/>I also have two teenage sons (from a previous marriage): Zach, 19, who is currently exploring nothing as a career choice, and Hayden, 17, who just joined the Army and is in the 101st Airborne.<br/><br/>I've been board and RP gaming off and on since the mid-70's. I'm an omnivorous gamer in that I'll pretty much play anything (at least once). <br/><br/>I tend to be a literary and film snob, although I like to think I'm in recovery.<br/><br/>I've edited some RPGs, and have a couple of writing credits in some others. I have an idea for a novel that has haunted me for nearly 20 years, but have not been able to make it manifest on paper. It refuses to let me be, no matter how hard or viciously I push it away. <br/><br/>And I'm damned glad to be here on Story Games!                        </div>

                            I'm Josh Riley, and I'm a graduate student working on a Ph.D in Neurolinguistics (a subfield of cognitive neuroscience). I currently do cross-linguistic research on speech perception in healthy people (looking at electrophysiological processing differences between speakers of English and Amharic, one of the major languages of Ethiopia) and speech production in disordered populations (putting the finishing touches on an fMRI study of a patient with foreign accent syndrome). I'm spoken for, and live in the D.C. area. I've studied Arabic in Morocco and Egypt, done fieldwork in the Republic of Georgia, and missed several crucial years of my cultural development due to being in Britain. <br/>
<br/>
I'd like to do work with a more clinical focus, but we'll see how that goes.<br/>
<br/>
I adore travel - crazier the better. Turkey is one of my favorite countries in the world, and am currently plotting out itineraries for an overland trip from Istanbul to Kathamandu that I and my SO will take in a couple years.<br/>
<br/>
As far as gaming is concerned, I got my start with White Wolf stuff, bounced around the Internet White Wolf RPing scene for a number of years, then got to uni and hooked about 20 people (at last count) on White Wolf games via the medium of a long-running Hunter game. I've since become disenchanted with WW mechanics, but I still love the sprawling, baroque, borderline-incoherent settings - they're nice and messy, like real life. Wrapping up a game of a PTA version of Changeling: The Dreaming set in Baltimore that was entirely inspired by a single song.<br/>

Glad I finally posted here.                        </div>

                            My name is Villum Lassen, i'm 28, Danish and study Philosophy at Aarhus University, currently working towards my master's on expertise.<br/>
<br/>
I've been lurking here for a couple of years, since i got fascinated by indie games. I've been roleplaying for 15 years or so, and recently started fiddling with game creation again because i got frustrated with Earthdawn.<br/>
<br/>
At the moment, i play in a Call of Cthulhu campaign. I haven't gotten round to actually playing much of that indie thing i got fascinated by, and havent been able to get the little bit i tried to sing.<br/>
<br/>
I also draw, and have a (intermittently updated) <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://vwl-tegner.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">blog</a> where i put drawings up for your appreciation.                        </div>

                            Hey everyone.  I kinda skipped this part.<br>
<br>
I'm Pete Cornell, I'm 40, single dad and special educator.  I will be hopefully working towards my BSN in the fall.  I'm a good friend of Judd's and I've met a couple of the people on here at various conventions, although I'm not sure they'd remember me.<br>
<br>
I'm running a retconned Against the Giants for a group and I'm playing in a SotC game, a BW game, and occasionally a Cat game (which I take a turn at running).<br>
<br>
I don't really have a blog, but I do contribute around when I feel I have something worth saying.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            I will just cut/paste what I have on my web page: "http://dochalloween.50webs.com/FAQ.html"<br/>
<br/>
I was born in 1969 as a Gemini male. I weigh 175 lbs. and I am 5 foot 8 inches tall. I have brown hair and green eyes. I have Autolycus style (a short thin mustache and small triangle soul patch) beard.<br/>
<br/>
I have lived near the peaceful Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia all my life. I loved to move to the West Coast (Washington, Oregon, or Alaska) or Canada one day. <br/>
<br/>
I am a Christian first and foremost. Without God and Jesus I would never have made it as far as I have. Many times I have asked for help and many times I was given it. I owe THEM my heart, soul, life, love, and service.<br/>
<br/>
A Native American I am. I am 1/4 Cherokee and 1/4 Blackfoot. My totem is Deer.<br/>
<br/>
Let me tell you about Deer that I follow. Deer is graceful, gentle, and sensitive. People with "Deer Medicine" are often described as being swift and alert. They are intuitive, often appearing to have well developed, even extra sensory perceptions. Sometimes their thoughts seem to race ahead, and they appear not to be listening. Just as the deer bounds from one place to another, a person with Deer Medicine often moves quickly from one situation to another, often never staying long enough in one place to get a "full meal."<br/>
<br/>
My hobbies vary depending on the mood I am in. I love building web pages as my biggest hobby. I have been building them for 10 years. I play computer games (mostly war games). I read fantasy and sci-fi paperbacks. I also enjoy going to the theater to watch a wide variety of films except sub-titles.<br/>
<br/>
Professionally I am a social worker. I hold other degrees in architecture, drafting, and mental health.<br/>
<br/>
Favorite Color................Purple<br/>
<br/>
Role Model....The late actor John Wayne and my Paw-paw<br/>
<br/>
Favorite Music....New age, Techno, New Swing, Bluegrass, and Big Band, 80's, Native American<br/>
<br/>
Favorite Radio Station....Q99 FM Roanoke, VA Best 80's, 90's and Today's Mix<br/>
<br/>
Favorite TV Station....WDBJ 7 Roanoke, VA<br/>
<br/>
Favorite Movie....Radio; The Family Man; The Village; Crash; and just about any World War II movie<br/>
<br/>
Favorite Book....Shadowrun novels and Forgotten Realms novels; lets not forget the Holy Bible<br/>
<br/>
Favorite RPG....Word Mill's "Mythic Role Playing"; Atomic Sock Monkey's PDQ "Zorcerer of Zo"; PIG's "Coyote Trail"; PEG/GWG's "Savage Worlds"                        </div>

                            Hello all!<br/>
I'm Kevin Reid-Rice.  I turned 41 the day of this post and have been gaming since I got the 1978 edition of D&amp;D at the tender age of 10.  I'm married to Aimee (14 years this November!), and I have two sons (Spencer &amp; Quinn).  We share our abode with 4 cats: Rupert, Murdock, Eartha Kitten and Xena, Warrior Kitten.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in Massachusetts (several places, all near Worcester), got to attend my first Gen Con when it was still held at Parkside.  I went to college at UW-Madison (long story), decided I loved Wisconsin, got married and stayed.  Now I do Real Estate work for the State of Wisconsin. (see what an English degree can do for you kids?)<br/>
<br/>
I have GMed my entire gaming career, playing on occassion, but always more comfortable behind the screen initiating mayhem.  While I've written a few articles here and there my gaming claim to fame is a distinct lack of it.  I've basked in the glow of folks who will be remembered for good or ill for years to come, and counted them my friends, and been enriched for it.<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm running a 4E camoaign, but my heart still belongs to Amber Diceless.<br/>
<br/>
And a word of warning: All you Gen Con posers can step off, a Gen Con outside Milwaukee ain't no Gen Con at all.  Word.<br/>
(And if that's not ridiculous coming from the 41 year old white nerd, I have no sense of irony left at all!)                        </div>

                            I've been posting for a little while here, I should finally introduce myself. My name is Jeremy Keller. I'm 34. I live in Minneapolis, MN. By day I work as a graphic artist and animator for a video productions company. Besides Minnesota, I've lived in California for 3 years, Colorado for 3 months, and Concord NH for 3 days. I recently returned to school and completed by BA in English. I'm now considering various post-grad options.<br/><br/>I've drawn a comic book, written 4 feature length screenplays, produced and directed two short films, programed the base graphics and networking code for an MMO, but all of those are just sitting on the shelf now. I have had my poems published in local journals, and I'm about to publish an RPG that I wrote.<br/><br/>Nice to meet you all.                        </div>

                            I am Justin Jackson. I grew up poor in the streets of Burlington Iowa. It was there I learned about my love for Roleplaying. Being able to become someone I wasnt was not only a way of escape it was a way to cope with being one of the "have nots". I eventually learned to enjoy playing the game for more than just being a way to escape and it is now more a hobby than a escape hatch. I am 23, I ended up in debt going to college and now am working to try to pay it off. I am currently trying my hand at creating my own game.                        </div>

                            My name is China Pittenger, I'm 35 years old and live in Aurora Indiana.  I lived in Florida from 2001 till November 2007, and couldn't be happier to be back in the rolling hills of my home state.<br/><br/>I'm a stay at home mother of three children, Raina (8), Aiden (5) and Xander (3).  I spend way too much time on the computer, but hardly any time on the television.  I tend to go from one obsession to the other, and haven't mastered the idea of moderation.<br/><br/>Once upon a time I had a real job at a real company, I'm quite a people person and pick up thing easily.  Now, I run a website and write with peers to give me that social aspect that I miss so much, and that sense of pride and accomplishment.  So, my time nowadays is spent between Sponge Bob and trying to master Drupal.                        </div>

                            Hello!<br/>
<br/>
I'm Julian Michels the Narrative Psychologist.<br/>
<br/>
I'm 22, and a graduate student at the University of Oregon. I'm a Story Now! designer and a psychological scientist. By day, I research and study how people learn and think and especially why they tell stories (including their mundane, everyday stories), and how these stories impact their identities and lives. As far as I know, I'm currently the only researcher examining collaborative story production, but my work is gradually becoming more well-known and I hope to see the creation of a thriving sub-field and a scholarly literature on this topic over the next ten or fifteen years.<br/>
<br/>
I organize and try to expand the small community of narrative gamers in Eugene, OR. I make fairly regular trips to visit with the GoPlayPDX community, and I love Indie Hurricane and GoPlayNW. It's really exciting to be in my position, because within the design community I can be a psychological expert and within the psychology community I can be a narrative expert, and because I feel that both fields have much to learn from each other. It's fun!<br/>
<br/>
I also practice martial arts and synthesize my own style of swordplay, based in 13th-century Italian Fiore dei Liberi but with influences from Aikido, jiu jitsu, and other sources. I instruct some folks in it locally, casually. I fill the time that's left with hobbies, like acting, dramaturgy, writing, composing, and collaborating with folks from dozens of different creative disciplines.                        </div>

                            I'm Mark Silcox. I'm a junior professor of philosophy at a four-year commuter university in Oklahoma, USA. I'm the faculty sponsor for my school's Chess and Games club, which to my delight has become a veritable haven for overworked pizza-addled D&amp;D and WOD fanatics who use gaming as an escape from the rigors of academe and from their crummy recession-era student jobs.<br/>
<br/>
From 1998-2002 I worked as a freelance writer for a couple of commercial computer game companies, producing interactive dialogue scripts for the MMORPG EARTH AND BEYOND and the Nintendo 64 game AIDYN:CHRONICLES: THE FIRST MAGE. During this period of cheerful poverty, I was also hip deep into the interactive fiction community and published a couple of IF games online. They're still out there, somewhere, echoing in the virtual void.<br/>
<br/>
Having just turned forty, I have decided that my mid-life crisis is going to revolve around a vast increase in the quantity of gaming in my life. I've been the Storyteller a very large WOD chronicle on campus with fourteen player-characters since February of this year, and I've just joined the local Camarilla. Out here in the boonies, it's hard to find that many folks who are willing to experiment with the more open styles of narrative gaming popular in this forum, but I've had a few wildly successful sessions of PANTHEON with some of my more intrepid game-clubbers, so I live in hope.                        </div>

                            So this awesome, smart, and talented community forum has become my obsession this week. I suppose I should introduce myself!<br/><br/>I'm Kira Scott. First and foremost, I'm an artist. I work in metals and glass enamels creating jewelry that I sell about town, <a href="http://www.animametals.etsy.com" rel="nofollow">on the web</a>, and at craft shows. I post about my artwork, jewelry, and all my thoughts about that good stuff on my <a href="http://kirascottart.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">blog</a> that I update pretty regularly. I have a BFA in metals/jewelry/CADCAM from Tyler School of Art in Philadelphia, where I moved from 2 years ago to my current residence in Columbus, Ohio. Here I live with my amazing husband Travis, and our two cats Faustus and Mika. I'm currently 28 years old, and work at the Columbus College of Art and Design in the Admissions Department, where I advise students on their portfolio artwork and travel about the US spreading the good word about how awesome our college is.<br/><br/>Also, obviously, I'm a huge geek. I love sci-fi, fantasy, comic books, movies, and gaming. I have a wide variety of tastes in gaming, most of them inspired by my artistic inclinations, and have been gaming since I was 15. I started out with the goth/punk Vampire, and my tastes have since evolved and grown, and still do with every new game out on the market. Currently, I love FATE (in all its forms), In A Wicked Age, 3:16 Carnage Amongst the Stars, WFRP, Monsters and Other Childish Things, Reign, Cyberpunk, Don't Rest Your Head, and Nobilis.                        </div>

Last year I self published a game and was able to con someone into publishing it for me shortly after check out www.4kids.tv/bigbigbattles for more on that project. i plan to start self publishing again within a year and an rpg features prominently into those plans. so I'm hear to glean wisdom and to share what I know.<br/>
<br/>
i look forward to getting to know this group better                        </div>

                            Hi! My name is Christopher Maikisch (you can certainly call me Chris, but I have a habit of writing / typing it out the long way), and I live in West Seattle with my brother and his obnoxious, non-euclidean cat. I bake cakes for a living, and I enjoy bacon quite a bit. I was able to attend Go Play NW this year, and it was really the best use I have made of a weekend in a long while. =]                        </div>

                            Hi! <br/>
<br/>
My name's Don, I'm 32 years old and I study social sciences in Germany (yes, I'm old for a student). <br/>
I've only just begun dipping my toes in non-mainstream RPGs, and, needless to say, I've read a lot of things/ideas on this site that I've never even heard about.<br/>
Perhaps I'll be able to contribute to discussions once I've actually wrapped my head around what y'all are talking about, ;o)<br/>
Eventually it would be interesting to see if I can somehow apply some of my knowledge in sociology to game design.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for having me here!                        </div>

<p>Hiya. I'm Steve Lawson. I'm a librarian at <a href="http://www.coloradocollege.edu/library/" rel="nofollow">Colorado College</a> in Colorado Springs. I'm 38 years old, married, and have sons ages 7 and 4. I have a blog called <a href="http://stevelawson.name/seealso" rel="nofollow">See Also...</a> where I write mostly about libraries and librarianship. I'm also pretty active on <a href="http://friendfeed.com/stevelawson/" rel="nofollow">FriendFeed</a>.</p>
<p>When I was about 8 years old, I got the Dungeons and Dragons Basic Set for Christmas and started playing D&amp;D and AD&amp;D with my friends (along with Traveler and a few wargames). This is also around the time my elementary school friends nicknamed me "bevedog" (rhymes with Steve-frog), which has provided me ever since with a handle that is almost never taken when it is time to create a new online account. No one actually calls me bevedog anymore. Please.</p>
<p>At about the age of 12 I stopped playing RPGs and tended to think of them as an important part of my childhood, but something I didn't really do anymore.</p>
<p>Now, due to a combination of circumstances--including unearthing my old D&amp;D stuff at my parents' house recently, my kids showing some interest, and meeting a lot of other librarians online who play RPGs--I'm interested again. I'm trying to play D&amp;D 4e with my kids ("there is no crying in D&amp;D!") and am hoping to start an online/email game of Mouse Guard with some more experienced gamer friends.</p>
<p>I found this site because my friend <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/account.php?u=236" rel="nofollow">Josh Neff</a> recommended it to me, saying it was a welcoming community. So far, I have found that to be true.</p>

                            I'm Victor Wyatt. I've been a roleplaying gamer for roughly 30 years, at least I'm nearing in on the 30 year mark. For a long time I've stuck with the larger games in the world of roleplay. Recently, over the last couple years, I have found the indie games to scratch itches I never knew I had. There is such a diversity in the indie collection of games. At this point I buy and try out anything I can get my hands on.<br/>
<br/>
My first games were D&amp;D (red box), Star Frontiers, Marvel Super Heroes and Call of Cthulhu. At this point I have so many games on my shelves that I couldn't tell you just how many there are anymore. And, as of this GenCon I increased that number by 11 new games.<br/>
<br/>
Due to the technology and skill visible in the indie games of late I'm attempting to toss my hat into the ring and create something of my own.                        </div>

                            My name is Gabriel Lopes Anaya, I´m 29 years old, from Brazil. I was born in Brasilia but now I live in Natal, warm and cozy coast city. I´m married with Katya and we live with a small shnauzer called Leela.<br/>
<br/>
I´m 3rd degree aikido black belt and work in a great dojo teaching this beautiful martial art. Also I´m working to get master´s degree in History and Spaces and finishing a specialization in work related diseases and work quality of life. I´m interested in history and philosophy of science topics, specially the Science and Technology Studies field and history of medical theories.<br/>
<br/>
I started to play with GURPS and D&amp;D (red box), then cyberpunk 2020, Kult, AD&amp;D (Ravenloft,Masque of Red Death), Vampire, Wraith, Fuzion "Blue Planet",Fuzion, Fudge, Werewolf the Forsaken, Fate, Shadowrun, Truth and Justice (PDQ) Risus (many campaigns) - the last one "RISUS: Estrada da Perdição" (Damnation Highway) we played young street racers in Brazil (something like 3rd world Initial D) with some very nice, creative and weird Cliché to describe cars, racers, highways, dangerous places and memories of a dead racer. <br/>
<br/>
Now I´m playing Sign In Stranger with Katya and Shock: with some friends.But I´m eager to play many games more: Contenders, Breaking the Ice (try the Enemy Mine variation), try Polaris (now with four "stable" friends), try some activity with non-humans with Radiance, play A Flower for Mara, Sea Dracula, DRYH, 3:16...They are here waiting... I wish I had more time to play.<br/>
Portuguese is my mother language, so I will do my best to write clearly in English. <br/>
<br/>
It´s nice to be here and share this stuff.                        </div>

I like games and poems, and sometimes I get nervous about things.<br/>

Especially after I started watching Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Recently turned 26. Never graduated college, though tried it twice. Participated in the Katimavik youth program. Worked mostly with children all of my life, mostly as a Camp Counselour (or Space Camp Counselour). Currently working as an daycare educator, but that's mostly temporary. I hope to become a professional storyteller in the next few years.

When I was a student at the University of Hamburg, we had plenty of students older than you.  Some of them had been going to college for 10+ years.  That's what you get with a no-tuition, no-credit (i.e., no accountability) system <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  Plus, of course, there are no Bachelor's Degrees--if you go to college in Germany, you're signing up for at least 6 years and end up with a Master's.<br/><br/>Anyway; welcome! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Hello all. My name is Micah J Bauer. I'm a married, Mormon, exCalifornian, graphic designer, BMXer, father of three, living in Springville, UT. <br/>
<br/>
Random Facts: (which probably make me sound more interesting than I actually am)<br/>
- I once wrote a college essay entitled "I Hate My Hair and Want to Die." <br/>
- As a kid I would pick up and save already chewed gum in my jeans pockets (to my mother's dismay). <br/>

                            Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I'm Anna. Although I've been a big huge geek for years, I had never done any sort of roleplaying until my boyfriend (Deliverator on these boards) first introduced me to the concept of story gaming. The first RPG I've ever played was Polaris, which is an...unusual start to say the least. Now, almost a year and a half later, I've played over 20 different story game systems and GMed/facilitated two.<br/>
<br/>
I graduated from Bryn Mawr College, just outside Philadelphia, this spring with a degree in anthropology, which means I can't even do something as mundane as grocery shopping without analyzing it to death. Although I love Philadelphia to death and wish I could have stayed around longer, I am most likely spending this coming year in Washington DC, doing health education work through AmeriCorps. (Or at least I hope so...I'll know for sure after tomorrow.) Although I spent a lot of time in DC growing up, there's still so much of the city I don't know...hopefully I can come to love it as much as I love Philadelphia and New York. <br/>
<br/>
When I'm not gaming, I enjoy wandering and getting lost in new cities, baking, folk dance (mostly contra and English, though I've done some Scottish and am open to learning new styles), singing casually, reading almost anything I can get my hands on, and knitting (rather badly so far, but I'm learning.)<br/>
<br/>
Like the above poster, I'm excited to be on these boards. Looking forward to meeting new people, and having further conversations with those I've already met at Dexcon and Dreamation!                        </div>

                            I'm Colin Creitz, which explains the handle. I'm an Eagle Scout and a machine learning expert, but have yet to build a classifier system out of rope and sticks.<br/><br/>The University of Pittsburgh is my alma mater; I got my degree in Computer Science and Philosophy there, and I consider myself a cultural Pittsburgher. No matter how long I live in Silicon Valley, and no matter how much I enjoy seeing the sun and being dry from time to time, I imagine I'll always feel that way. Every November, when it finally rains here, I get homesick in a way that requires me to watch a lot of football and eat pierogies and drink Sam Adams Boston Lager — made in Pittsburgh by PBC, the brewers of Iron City. When I open a bottle, I know it was capped at home.<br/><br/>Now I'm 32, happy and married, and have two small and adorable boys. I took a break from gaming between their births, and came back to the hobby hoping to sharpen my skills for eliciting stories from them, so we'll never run out.                        </div>

                            I seem to have missed this thread as well, so I may as well have a go at it!<br/>
<br/>
Lee Williams here, from more or less the centre of England. I am a genuine 1965 vintage human male with no replacement parts (as yet!) :) I haven't really ever had what you'd call a career, just a succession of different jobs, The most recent of these has been working in a real ale pub. I started out as a schoolboy wargamer and have been into roleplaying since I first saw the original Traveller box set when I was about 14. One of my crowning acheivements as a gamer was destroying the entire world during the 1920s, in one of the Kult Of Keeper's infamous (and brilliant) multi-table games at Continuum 2006. I was a member of the Demonground magazine team for some time and am now one of the triumvirate in charge of Protodimension, another free horror gaming 'zine.<br/>
<br/>
As things stand, I haven't got a regular game running at the moment but I am keen on throwing my mates into 3:16 as soon as they take a break in their SLA game...                        </div>

                            My name is Adam!  I am a big nerd and have been for some long time.  I have a dungeons and dragons tattoo.  I am very proud of it. <br/><br/>I don't really like to ramble on about myself, but here's some things I care about - I am intensely interested in human relationships and have a handful of them.  I love my little brother and my girlfriend and the people I play games with.  I work in marketing but only sort of (i'm a support tech for a CMS / Marketing Automation company).  I take photographs and ride a fixed-gear bike and have a lot of fun with both.<br/><br/>I've been vegan longer than I haven't and consider it a mere part of my life rather than something I am active about.  It merely is.  <br/><br/>What else?  I am friendly, or try to be.  Clever, though not as much as I seem.  What else is there to say?  I don't know.  I am short and blonde.                        </div>

                            Hi. I'm Tazio Bettin, I'm 29 and I'm of the Leo, ascendant in Aquarius. I'm from Padova, Italy. It's a city close to Venice, home to one of world's oldest universities where Galileo Galilei studied the stars. I'm a Japanese language university graduate, I've been living in Tokyo, I'm in love with history and world's cultures. I work in the tourism world and can speak Japanese as well as Italian and English. And I have some basic knowledge of Sanskrit, and I've studied ancient Greek and Latin. <br/>
I'm addicted to drawing and digital painting and of course roleplaying games. I'm a bibliophile and I prefer treatises over fiction, with the important exception for science fiction, which is my favorite genre. My favorite writer is Frank Herbert.                        </div>

                            I'm Jens Alfke. I'm 44 and live in San José, California. I've spent my life simultaneously exploring and running away from geekiness.<br/>
<br/>
I was first exposed to RPGs via the old-school D&amp;D box in high school, which my group quickly supplemented with the first AD&amp;D books, the Arduin Grimoire and our own home-brewed rules. We didn't really "roleplay" as such, but we rolled a lot of dice and killed a lot of monsters.<br/>
<br/>
In college I gave up RPGs and explored real-life activities like socializing, punk rock, and having a girlfriend. OK, and lots and lots of programming (which means my parents got something out of their investment, as that helped me get jobs.)<br/>
<br/>
Once I had jobs I was still too busy for RPGs ... first with work and socializing, then with work and marriage, then work and raising small children.<br/>
<br/>
Now I would like to get back into this stuff. I've been playing boardgames off and on for a few years, and reading up on newer RPGs including Fate, Grimm, Risus and Burning Wheel. (No D&amp;D though, please.) But I have yet to play any of these games for real, though I've just joined a group that's tentatively planning to start a Burning Wheel campaign...                        </div>

                            I'm Greg Cooksey.  I'm 31, live in Austin, TX, and write test automation tools for web developers.  Ladies, I'm available.  I grew up outside Chicago, moved to Madison, WI to study computer science and linguistics, eventually got a master's in computer science, and moved to Austin just about a year ago.  I've picked up a coffee habit since I started working full-time in the software industry.<br/><br/>I consider myself politically and religiously anarchist.  I like Chomsky's politics, but not his linguistics.  While I was in Madison, I volunteered with a radio news show on a community station, and I try to keep up with media activism.<br/><br/>I bicycle commute and don't own a car, so it's really nice living somewhere where I can bike year-round.<br/><br/>In my free time I play tabletop games, both RPGs and board/card games, and go to concerts &amp; other performances.  I'm kind of a music geek, but don't have the vocabulary or theory background to really talk intelligently about it.  I mostly like instrumental music with an experimental bent, but have a pretty wide-ranging collection.  I learned how to play violin when I was short, but I don't remember how any more.  I'd like to learn again.  I also toy with making electronic music every once in a while but have really just been a dilettante.<br/><br/>I drank a glass of rum to celebrate the Piratepartiet gaining representation in the EU parliament.                        </div>

                            Hi, everyone-<br/>
<br/>
Jim Crocker from Northampton, MA here. I am the owner of an independent comic and game shop called <i>Modern Myths</i> here in town. I have been involved in the book or hobby trade for my entire adult life, starting with a job at a used bookstore that put me through college, to experience with chain stores and even some work at the corporate level of one major chain. I've been an owner for some 7 years now, and it has been immensely rewarding. My degree is actually in theater, but that world proved too mercurial for my disposition, but gaming has been all I;ve really needed to scratch that itch over the last decade or so since I stopped doing any actual organized theater.<br/>
<br/>
I started gaming with D&amp;D in the late 70s (first 'blue box' B&amp;W edition) and have done so with only a brief 'nerd-denial phase late in high school until I met friends in college with the good sense not to care what other people thought of their hobby. Since then, I have played many, many RPGs mainstream to obscure, and have recently become very enamored of the story-form games that a lot of the very smart and talented local creators around here are involved in. I've had a few minor bits published freelance here and there, but I am here mostly because of my personal interet in this new form, as well as the professional angle of wanting to see where different part of the hobby are headed, and how it might affect my business.<br/>
<br/>
I'll be helping out the fine folks at JiffyCon here in Western MA next month, and hope to be more involved in that effort going forward.<br/>
<br/>
I'm married to a woman who plays RPGs as well, though definitely not with the same frequency as I. Early 40s, no kids, 2 cats, vegetarian, politics and religion abut what you'd expect from a child-free adult couple who've settled in Northampton.<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking forward to seeing the discussion, maybe joining in here and there if I can think of something cogent to say, and hopefully meeting some of you at Cons or game gatherings in the future.<br/>
<br/>

                            hello there<br>
<br>
i've been following the thread in the darkness for a while, through rss, and i suddenly decided to make my "coming out". My english is just (on not even) average, but i manage to understand what i need to. i'm from Europe / south of France, been living in Spain and married ( yes, i'm 3x years) with a south American, so i speak usually both languages.<br>
<br>
I've been a big rpg gamer in the 80's ( golden years or RPG ?), Coc &amp; stormbringer were my favorite (as a DM and sometimes a player), but i've played many many more ( from paranoia to james bond, and a lot of french rpg). My last game was form 94, a Coc. As many gamers, while entering university, travelling, working and being away from my "group", i've been playing less and less, as it became "impossible".<br>
<br>
At the meantime, i've been playing light /eurogames boardgames from the early 90's, probably as a substitution. BG need no preparation, are short ( compared to RPG), and do not intimidate the non (RPG) gamers. Then i realize that i was enjoying only games with a strong theme....and possibly with a space for imagination, acting, roleplaying...<br>
<br>
For a bunch of years, i'm trying to synthesise all this and going back to the other way: a mutant RPG that could be used with non gamers, family, kids, and so on. I first tried to look for into boardgames and BG mechanism. then, i also discovered "indies" RPG and story gaming which impressed me a lot.<br>
<br>
So here i am.<br>
<br>
 I' ve open a blog (in french) in order to list all games matching with these "specifications" ("cahier des charges") and make some experiment, trying to find the perfect game, or bring life to a new Frankenstein...<br>
<br/>
Mon cahier des charges ( my "book of specifications")<br/>
<br/>
No workload for prep. and gaming<br/>
- no prep fro the Master ( or hopefully , no master :everyone can play)<br/>
- Short/reasonable time og game ( 45 min-2 hours)<br/>
<br/>
Opened to non gamers / do not intimidate them :<br/>
- Strong mechanism (like boardgames) for those who cannot<br/>
- Fun before all ! ( dice, bid, bluff..)<br/>
- No obscure backgrounds                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Hello everybody!<br/>
I'm Michael Tangherlini, I come from Italy; I'm a marine biologist, constantly looking for viruses in the deep-sea muds.<br/>
I'm fond of roleplaying, and I've just started working on my own home-made games. I came here to receive some feedback on some ideas I had and that I'd like to test.<br/>

                            Hi, it's been a long time since I've played actively, but I still think in RPG terms and if I ever find the time, it would be great to play again.  I spend time thinking not suo much about the story, but more some deep cover which is random but not too insulting.  My day job is librarian and I'm also an amateur computer programmer.  So hey, look forward to meeting some of youse.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite>That is an amazingly cool niche. I know, way off topic for the board (hence the whisper), but: how does one go about finding viruses in deep-sea mud? What do they infect? Aren't they really hard to culture once you've retrieved them (if you do retrieve them rather than somehow study them in situ)?</blockquote>
There are many ways to look for viruses within the sediments: checking for their DNA, staining them with some kind of dye to see them under a microscope and so on. They usually infect anything, ranging from bacteria to algae to even sea turtles. And yes, we can't yet culture them, but we can still study their genome.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite>I'm thinking this is great background material for an adventure hook!</blockquote>
Hope you can find it useful! Personally, I'm trying to create a boardgame about viruses. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>-MikeT                        </div>

                            "My name is Michael Caine."  Not really.  <br/><br/>My name is Ben Miller and I use the moniker _The Bunyip_ online in most places, including here.<br/><br/>I'm 36 and live with my wife Marie and our 3 cats.  Soon we'll be having a two-legged addition to the menagerie.  I live in pretty much the very center of England and work in video-games software.  I started roleplaying when I was about 14, dabbling briefly (doesn't everybody?) in D&amp;D and then moving swiftly on to Chaosium games like Elfquest, Runequest and Call of Cthulhu.  Whilst at University I pretty much stopped playing RPGs totally.  Most of my friends had 'grown out of them' and I had other things on my mind like girls and drinking.  After a hiatus of about, um, 8 years then, I finally returned to roleplaying and latched onto The Forge.<br/><br/>Since then I've been trying to write various games but never actually got very far with any of them.  Somebody always seems to have thought of a better way to do what I was doing, and the wind goes out of my sails.<br/><br/>Like a few others on this forum it seems, I spend quite a lot of time thinking about where to take my creative impulse, but never quite acting decisively on it.  I'd like to write a story-telling RPG someday soon, but I've learnt not to promise myself that because it always ends up in frustration.<br/><br/>Hmm, that wasn't a very optimistic first post now was it?! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Ah well...<br/>Hello everyone<br/>I'm Ben                        </div>

                            Well, I'll post here, since it's The Thing to Do.<br/>
<br/>
My name's Mike Holmes, but I go by Holmes! in all of my online endeavors, and my friends and colleagues all call me Holmes! in Real Life. There are just too damn many "Mikes" about!<br/>
<br/>
I'm a web developer for a living and a punk rocker by avocation; I've played in punk and hardcore bands for over twenty years, and I'm proud to report that I've never learned a scale... I also play folk and country music, where my musical naivete also puts me in good stead. I'm about to turn 37 in a couple of days, and I live with my partner, a gorgeous gal who's game for gaming, six cats, and a dog.<br/>
<br/>
I'm an active board gamer who reads about story games more than he plays them, though I'd like for that to change. I'm an aspiring board game designer; my last finished game is about Vaudeville theater owners, and I've got some in my head with punk rock and hip-hop themes that I'm hoping to get prototyped, soon...<br/>
<br/>
In addition to music and gaming, I'm a lover of comics. Comic books are cool, and I read 'em, but my first love is comic strips. I've been a Peanuts fanatic since I was a kid, but these days I concentrate on older comics as co-curator of Barnacle Press, an online repository of comics mostly dating from between 1900 and 1920.<br/>
<br/>
As far as RPGs and Story Games go, I spent my youth playing D&amp;D like everyone else. I've also spent a lot of time playing Cthulhu and GURPS Cyberpunk. Though I own a lot of story game source books, the only one I've spent any playing time with is Primetime Adventures, which I absolutely adored and can't wait to play again. I plan on bringing A Penny For My Thoughts to the table tomorrow night at my regular gaming session, and I'm hoping it'll go over well. Cross your fingers for me; if it "takes", I'll be trying to get some other Story Games into the mix, soon...                        </div>

                            Hello, this is Davide Losito, also known as Khana in italian forums.<br/>
I am 34, soon 35. Playing RPGs since early 90s and I basically played all of the "major titles".<br/>
I have eventually become a designer and my system named Fragma has just been brought to the public in last Lucca Games &amp; Comics event, a week ago, as native system of the game Elar. The game is the ending phase of a 4 years "travel" that brought me from tarditional RPGs to modern view of coherent design. The whole book is product of a group of people who worked together to bring the book to the point it is now.<br/>
<br/>
About me... I am a philospher for passion and a web designer for work... that's because philosophy is cool but it doesn't give you any way to sustain your life.<br/>
I am also part of Coyote Press, which is the third, small and last publishing brand of indie RPGs in Italy. We translated Covenant, Cold City and have Committee and Solipsist under work ^^                        </div>

In the past couple of years I have gotten pretty into indie games thanks to a push from Rich Rogers.  Other then gaming I am pretty heavy into electronic music (industrial to indie dance), knitting and all sorts of other ill shit.  Oh I am 30 and live in Jacksonville FL.                        </div>

                            Howdy folks. Live from Toronto, Canada I'm Wil Patrick, currently 18? I'm pretty sure. I've been gaming since I was 8, starting with the lovable Red Box. Times have changed and I have spread my reach to a broader range of games. I play indie games and games that are not quite trad. Currently I'm studying at the University of Toronto in English and Mediaeval Studies.<br/>
<br/>
In gaming I'm working with David Hill on a project, I've dropped my hat into the Simian Circle 2010 contest, I'm writing RPG reviews every other Monday, hosting an AP podcast, and I'm doing my own stuff as well.<br/>

                            Hi all. I have been posting here for a year or so, and never posted to this thread. I am bad forum member.<br/><br/>I am 35, live in beautiful Washington DC with my fiancee and two cats, work as a supervisor at a wire service (government/politics PR and news stuff), and play music (sometimes touring, sometimes recording).<br/><br/>I played D&amp;D, Shadowrun and various Palladium games all through junior high and high school, and then not much until D&amp;D 3rd edition, which got me back into gaming. I found my way to indie/story/narrative/new-school games through various sources, including the nerdNYC forum (I used to live in Brooklyn) and the Sons of Kyros podcast. Over the last 2-3 years I have gotten excited about gaming in a way I hadn't been since I was 14. <br/><br/>Story Games is a great forum. I'm glad it exists.                        </div>

                            Hi all. <br/>
<br/>
I'm Jerome (though nicknamed "Brand" for years and using it extensively on the internet).I am a 31 year old French working usually as an IT project manager and doing some freelance game design/writing. Most of the game ranges I worked on are only published in French, so I guess nobody would have heard about them here. I think only Qin : the warring states and Kuro might be translated in english.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, I have mainly a Business/IT background and had the chance to live in Pennsylvania a few years ago to get MBA. More than that I have an avid fascination for late 1500's japanese history, screenwriting techniques and many other subjects that little (if any) chance to help me to pay the rent.                        </div>

                            Hi there! i've been lurking the forums for some months now, and writing a couple of times, but i had forgotten to write  here... easily fixed, though.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Alberto, i am Italian and i study International Relations. I'm really in love with roleplaying games and music, but lately the absence of free time and some bad luck (both bands and gaming groups continuously breaking down) have kept me from practicing both. I am full of resolution to start back for good, though. <br/>
I mainly started with D&amp;D (3E), then WoD (which, at the time, was the cool, roleplay-intensive, underground thing... at least, for me), then other stuff: some freeform, some mdified D&amp;D, a brief cycle on mutant and masterminds, exalted, nightlife, and that's kinda it. <br/>
I would also like to write a game, and have a couple mechanics in my mind that could be interesting... but i have to test out more systems and get some more experience, first!                        </div>

                            I guess after posting a couple of dozen discussions I ought to finally introduce myself.  First the bio my agent uses for me:
<blockquote>A Texas native transplanted to the Washington DC metroplex, Sam Hawken uses his background as an historian to inform his work.  Such authors as <a href="http://www.craigmcdonaldbooks.com/" rel="nofollow">Craig McDonald</a>, Dave Zeltserman and Western Writers of America President Johnny Boggs have praised Sam’s writing in the mystery and western fields, and Sam has contributed short stories and essays to several anthologies and fiction periodicals under different pen names.</blockquote>
For those who are curious, I've used probably ten different pen names trying to settle on good ones.  I currently have only one, which I use to write commercial fiction aimed largely at women.  Otherwise I write under my own name.<br/><br/>So clearly I'm a writer and, yes, I'm trained as an historian, with my field being Jewish and Middle Eastern history.  I've done work in the field, but jobs for historians without a terminal degree have become pretty scarce on the ground.  I write full-time now, with two of my manuscripts having been picked up at the close of 2009 for publication in late 2010 or early 2011 (the wheels of publishing turn slowly).  In the meanwhile I'm at work on something new.  You can track my progress on it by <a href="http://twitter.com/sjhawken" rel="nofollow">following me on Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.samhawken.com/" rel="nofollow">reading my blog</a>.<br/><br/>Anyway, I've been gaming for thirty years, starting with <i>D&amp;D</i> — because didn't everybody? — and moving largely into modern-era games like <i>Top Secret</i> and <i>James Bond 007</i>.  These days I'm very much into the indie- and story-games movement, though I'm mostly just an enthusiastic amateur.  In fact the only one of these types of games I have much experience with is <i>Apocalypse World</i> and even then I spend half my time wondering if I'm doing it right.<br/><br/>I'm not a game designer, but I can talk about games and gaming until the cows come home.  I spend entirely too much time chatting on <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=10236" rel="nofollow"><a href="/forums/search?Search=%23playnow&amp;Mode=like">#playnow</a></a>, so if you're interested in continuing the talkity-talk drop by and let 'er rip.                        </div>

                            I've been periodically around here since Dreamation 2008, but it is only now that I am procrastinating badly enough to get around to posting here...<br/><br/>This is my real name.  I'm about to be 33, white, from a relatively high SES, working in the education sector (I teach in the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland), to which I commute from my single-family home in Baltimore (which I think of as close to DC, but might as well be the moon in terms of getting DC-area gamers to come up this way) containing myself, two cats, my lovely wife, and 21-month-old daughter.  I hope that satisfies the demographic data collectors?<br/><br/>I've been gaming since starting with the D&amp;D Red Box at 9, but only had experience with fairly traditional games until being introduced to Unsung by its creator in 2004 or so - though I have still never ACTUALLY PLAYED Unsung, which gives me great consternation as someone whose professional field is morality and warfare (with a particular focus on peacekeeping, counterinsurgency, and Africa).  Oh well.  Now I play, blah blah you don't want a list of my games.<br/><br/>In my non-gaming spare time I cook and lift weights, usually not together.  People who tell me they aren't "into" politics give me conniptions.  I have two desks, both of which are very messy.  I don't live in the part of Baltimore depicted on "The Wire."                        </div>

May I ask you what you're teaching precisely? i am a bachelor student with a major in International Relations, and would like to specify, in my master, in International Security, so it seems to me we might have some common areas. And people who tell me they aren't into politics leave me negatively shocked, too.                        </div>

                            Hi all,<br/><br/>I could have sworn I did one of these here back when I first joined, but I guess not.<br/><br/>I'm John, from Seattle.  I go by Longspeak or sometimes Longspeak Teller on most forums.  The name comes from back when I demoed Everway for the Rubicon Rubes.  The "Teller" family was the family in Everway who told stories to the people, so Rubicon's Tellers were the demo crew.  Longspeak was suggested by a friend who observed that I sure like to talk a lot (sorry, it's not for "Longs Peak," though I've been asked a few times.<br/><br/>I'm 42 for now.  By education I'm a programmer and network guy, but I left that behind a long time ago for the world of numbers.  If you need someone to help with your old Novell 3.12 network, I'm your man!  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  Assuming I can actually remember any of it.<br/><br/>I'm married to a gamer girl, have a gamer girl for a daughter, and my son is a console/PC gamer.  Sometimes we sit around the table to play Settlers of Catan, one of the many versions of Cosmic Encounter, or Munchkin.  Or Killer Bunnies.<br/><br/>But role-play is my first gaming love.  My dad bought my best friend the blue box of D&amp;D for his 12th birthday.  He said "I guess we should try playing it," and the rest is history.  Over the years, my hobby has been a continual quest to simplify the mechanics and get on with the story.  AD&amp;D lost its place in my heart to The Fantasy Trip.  TFT lost to Over the Edge.  OTE lost to Everway, which was my staple game for about ten years.  Then I found indie games and simpler mechanics gave way to more focused mechanics.  I don't go in for all the theory, but I like a lot of what that theory has produced.  Everway gave way to Pretender and Wushu (though in this case "gave way" doesn't really fit; I still play Everway), then to Polaris and Dogs in the Vineyard.  There have been dozens more but those are the games I'm most fond of.<br/><br/>I'm President of Dragonflight, a group in Seattle who runs a convention and operates a gaming club.  We're non-profit for the past 30 years, dedicated to promoting hobby gaming (all sorts, not just role-playing).<br/><br/>Outside of gaming, I love film.  I particularly love watching, rewatching, pausing, rewinding, and discussing what we watch together.  My daughter turned me on to theater when I discovered she is (in all objective honesty) the BEST ACTOR EVER.  Through her eyes I've discovered a whole new form of entertainment I'd previously ignored (who knew before movies actors performed LIVE before AN AUDIENCE?  Crazy.  I especially enjoy small, independent theater, though one of the most memorable experiences we've had was a couple years back when she and I dressed up in our suits (pinstripe for her, classic black for me) and drove to Portland to see Spamalot.  Sure, it was coming to Seattle later, but we didn't feel like waiting another couple of months.<br/><br/>Near the end of 2009, I was overcome with ennui.  I'd stare for hours at what had become my huge collection of games, unable to work up any excitement.  After a lot of pondering, I decided the collection had to go.  I would prune away the clutter and free up spaces in my head in the process.  My new rule is "If I won't play it, or run it, use it for another game, read it, or enjoy it in some other way, I will not keep it."  Since that decision, I've reduced my collection to a still largish library, and cuts continue.  I've also rediscovered my excitement, so there's that.  I still OWN too many books, but the unused ones are off the shelf and in boxes until I can find a new home for them.  In fact, it's worked so well, I plan to try it in other areas of the house.  Get rid of movies I won't watch again, books I won't read again, music I won't listen to again and games I won't play again.  Simplify!<br/><br/>Anyway, that's me.  Happy to be back.                        </div>

                            Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I already know some of you from the Burning Wheel forums, so this is only sort of like going to a support group.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm Colin, am 27, live in the fair city of Seattle, and have been gaming for a while.  In terms of schooling, I'm a proud Hampshire College Cognitive Science dropout and an equally proud University of Washington Information School graduate, and somehow managed to get a computer job in Seattle after only seven months of unemployment.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a really bad habit of picking up games that look cool without thinking first if I have any friends who I can browbeat into running, since I get really stressed out when GMing.  As such, I own several games that I'll probably never get to see in action.  Of course more collaborative game play is a good way around that issue, but then I have the other problem of convincing enough of my friends that it'll be fun and work out.  One of these days I'll make them see the awesome and then it'll be great.<br/>
<br/>
I also like long walks, pie, and my cat, though generally not all at once since she doesn't like to go too far from my house and then fur gets in the filling.                        </div>

                            Hello hello<br/><br/>I'm Yunus. I go by Taha Celestin on various games forums when I'm feeling pseudonymous and Yunuswesley on others when I'm not. 30s, married, PhD candidate in religious studies working with Islam, Buddhism, traditional textual/scholarly culture, and contemplative and esoteric forms of religion; presently living in Atlanta.<br/><br/>I got back into gaming about three years ago. In that time I've run a short GURPS Lovecraftian conspiracy/horror campaign, the Call of Cthulhu "Masks of Nyarlathotep" campaign using Trail of Cthulhu, have played in some one-offs, and am now running a short series of Diaspora sessions. <br/><br/>My current group is predicated on various of us taking turns as GM of different short runs of some game or other. Theoretically people other than me are going to be GM, but it's difficult not to keep obsessively pitching scenarios and games I'm excited about. GMing has always been my favorite part of the hobby, but time commitments do make it appealing to play instead.  And at some point I'm very interested in trying GM-less things like Polaris or  The Shab al-Hiri Roach... not least because I have some good gaming friends online with whom running something between the two of us seems more appealing than trying to rope in a third player for a traditional game.<br/><br/>I was out of gaming since the late 90s, when I was finishing college. At that time I was totally fed up with role-playing. The logistics of keeping people committed to regular games was a huge hassle, and I was longing for a depth of story and character involvement I never saw, didn't know how to do, and basically gave up on then.<br/><br/>The games I play in now *are* hugely fun and satisfying. Thinking about when i quit gaming, play now does not have the urgency I wanted then: I've gotten it elsewhere through life experiences that had nothing to do with rolling dice or taking on a role separate from the growth of my actual personality and inner life. But what we do now is much better than anything I was involved with in high school or college.<br/><br/>A big part of the appeal of gaming has to do with creative outlet. I love to narrate scenes, particularly scenes of wonder or horror, that come into my brain from the ether, and I'm not interested (presently) with writing or illustration. So my recent love of Diaspora has a lot to do with playing world- and scene-building with setting mechanics.

                            Hi SGers,<br/>
<br/>
My name's Alon Elkin. I'm in my mid-20s, a resident of Jerusalem (the one in Israel, not the one in Arkansas), a graduate student of linguistic, an antiquarian and a freelance translator (Hebrew/German/English). Aside from my fascination with roleplaying, I'm also an avid cyclist, and enjoy art, philosophy, beer and old obscure Hebrew texts (which I occasionally blog about).<br/>
<br/>
I started playing RPGs at the age of 12, and have been sporadically playing since. I don't have a regular group, but since there are plenty of local conventions in Israel, I get to play and GM quite a lot.<br/>
<br/>
I began playing with a simplified version of GURPS, and later, due to the lack of a regular group, switched to more single-session oriented games such as Paranoia and Kobolds Ate my Baby. I was a member of the Paranoia Online community in 2004, when a guy called Alan Varney came along and elicited the help of the online community for writing the new edition (Paranoia XP). When asked about the mechanics, he started rumbling about "GNS" and "indie game design sensibilities", which led me to the Forge, which ultimately led me here. I since had fun with some indie games - mostly InSpectres and IAWA, for which I've also translated some play materials to Hebrew; I've also enjoyed the more esoteric games by Zack Arston, MonkeyWrench and Adventures in Space!! whose texts I've translated entirely.<br/>
<br/>
My most important insight about RPGs is that I believe roleplaying, at heart, is a children's game, no different than others like hide &amp; go seek. And just like hide &amp; go seek doesn't get any less fun as you grow up (yet most of us stop playing it at a certain age until we have children of our own), so do roleplaying games. Sure, you can add sex, graphical violence, insoluble moral dilemmas and other adult stuff to your RPGs to make them more fun for you as a grown-up; this is akin to playing hide &amp; go seek with paintball or airsoft guns and camouflage suits. At its core, though, the fun comes from re-engaging in child's play. Rather then reject this aspect of roleplaying and avoid the social stigma that accompanies adults who play children's games by claiming that the games we play are adult stuff for serious people, we should be proud of our ability, at our age, to continue engaging in the sort of activities that make children the creative little fiends that they are.<br/>
<br/>
Since coming to this realization, I've been teaching D&amp;D to children at a local elementary school. I've also made myself a habit of GMing a game for children or teens at every convention I go to, and can all heartedly recommend these actions to any gamers who wants to invigorate their own regular play experience.                        </div>

                            Hey y'all.  I just searched this thread and discovered I haven't posted here yet, and I've been a member since 2006.  However, I'm mostly a lurker on these boards.<br/><br/>My name is James and I earn my living as an elementary school teacher.  I started my gaming life with 1st. Ed. AD&amp;D.  I played for a few years, then left the hobby.  I came back to it in the early 90's with 2nd Ed.  D&amp;D.  Played off and on through the 90's.  Began regular gaming around 2000, continuing with D&amp;D and some Hero system (ugh) and Paranoia. <br/><br/>Then at GenCon SoCal 2005 Wick and Sorensen introduced me to indie games (Inspectres and Cat).  However, I couldn't convince my trad gaming friends to try these new games.  Finally, at GenCon SoCal 2006 I played Burning Wheel (and some other indie games I don't remember now).  I met some indie gamers and wannabies, like me.  I haven't looked  back since.  I've even convinced some of those from my old trad group to give Inspectres a go.  <br/><br/>My current group's main game is inspired by The Song of Ice and Fire using a homebrew system that evolved from Polaris.  When someone can't make it, we play a supers game using the same system.  <br/><br/>Games I'd like to play: Burning Wheel (I've only played once!),  Mouse Guard, Danger Patrol, Happy B-day Robot, octaNe, and a bunch of other games I can't think of right now.                        </div>

                            Well, I've been a lurker up until now.<br/>
<br/>
Noah, 37, married to a delightful and tolerant woman, father of 3 superb boys. I live in Zionsville, Indiana, a small town/suburb northwest of Indianapolis. I don't get to GenCon as often as I like, or should (been once). This recently passed Easter marks my first year as a Catholic. I've been gaming for 25 years, mostly 'trad'. I'm lucky enough to have an excellent regular group in Indy, but with a few exceptions, they're not going to get out of 'trad' gaming anytime soon, if ever - but I've got a regular GM who's committed to good story, thankfully. As far as 'indie' games go, I live somewhat vicariously through the AP reports of others...<br/>
<br/>
The potential of 'indie' games fascinates and draws me in with terrible ferocity; as I've aged, the story and character development has become far more important than the list of stuff that used to be the focus of my character sheets.                        </div>

                            Heh, my first roleplaying was in junior high in Lexington. Lunchtime, Hardy the class clown GMed pretty freeform games of what he called "Dungeons and Dragons," with flipped coins for resolution. We went from some post-apocalyptic warzone with flying cars and bazookas to a middle ages where people spoke in first person about "10th level wizards." Were we playing "ourselves" or loose pawn-stance characters? Hard to remember at this point. The lack of books, character sheets, dice, or any intention to do anything except use our imaginations so hard it hurt... sticks in my mind as "indie" play in the sense of "punk."                        </div>

All that being said, you can usually find me asleep under a tree in the woods somewhere, phone dead and research long forgotten (much to the ire of my advisors).                        </div>

When I get back to the states, I'll be in North Carolina and I will start a gaming blitz! I started RPGs with AD&amp;D2, when I was a wee lad, tooled around with that World of Darkness stuff, enjoyed numerous one off games of various systems, and had enjoyable campaigns with "Bubblegum Crisis" and "Teenagers from Outer Space". Then I moved and entered a far too long gaming drought with the occasional pick-up game. Now I've gotten into the indie hotness and I'm reigniting my love of game design. And I just recently wandered over here and am enjoying it immensely. Oh yeah, I also hang out over at the praxis forum.                        </div>

                            Hello, my name's Harry. I'm about to turn thirty, and I live in Portland with my son, who's about to turn five. I work as a preschool teacher, which I've been doing for the last ten or twelve years. In my free time, I try to teach myself how to draw, watch movies, go to the occasional show, attend local soccer matches, and of course, play games. I played RPGs as a kid, and then lost interest as I became more invested in the DIY hardcore/punk community, which is probably the big formative experience of my adolescence. When I was about twenty-five, I started playing D&amp;D and boardgames again with some other punk kids from around here, and that really rekindled my love of play. It's only in the last year or so that I've discovered this whole other world of RPGs, and I've been fortunate enough to meet some friendly local folks through GoPlayPDX that have shown me the ropes. I've been registered here for a while, but haven't posted very often - maybe that will change now. Have a good day!                        </div>

                            Hi, I just joined yesterday. I'm in my mid 20s and I live all over the place but presently I'm on the coast of Oregon. I'm a gardener, forager, amateur ecologist and a bit of a hermit too, I guess. My RPG experience is limited to a DnD4E campaign and some "off the cuff" games with friends, using simple free systems from around the internet. I'm interested in learning to run games well, techniques and tips for better stories, and in discovering new games that suit my tastes. I'd also be able to make it to events in Portland but not very frequently as I don't drive.                        </div>

                            Mark Pankhurst, 34 (I think, I've reached the point where have to count now), living in UK near Chester. For coin, I do web back-end stuff.<br/>
Gamewise, I started out playing D&amp;D 2nd ed. at college, but lost touch with my gaming buddies. Eventually started pining for a bit of hack-and-slash. As if by magic, discovered that several of my workmates were old gamers looking to start playing again, and we started up a new group which is still going. Currently running D&amp;D and playing Dark Heresy, with a few other bits on the side.<br/>
I spend a lot of time on trains, so I'm often thinking about new dungeons and such to throw at my players. I'm a massive fan of How to Host a Dungeon, which is what brought me here. Hoping to spark some interest in another collaborative HtHaD game, like the one I've seen played out on the boards here.                        </div>

Started playing about 1975 with T&amp;T and White box D&amp;D. Moved on to all the usual suspects: Traveller, RuneQuest, Cthulhu. Have played pretty much continually since then without any major hiatuses. Will play most things, currently have a 3.5 D&amp;D game that's been going since 2000, before that a Runequest game 1990-2000. Also playing in a friend's D&amp;D 4e game. Currently trying to set up and run some RQ Tekumel, of which I'm a big fan. Have also recently picked up Chronica Feudalis, Remember Tomorrow and Atomic Highway.<br/>
<br/>
Other stuff: I'm also into boardgames a lot (mostly German), which started in about 1990 when I bought a copy of McMulti, and discovered the fanzine Sumo (and have since filled the house with games). I also like cooking (Indian, Chinese, Thai, French, Belgian), am a big fan of Belgian and German beer and like to go walking when I can.<br/>
<br/>
I live with a partner who also likes RPGs (she often plays fighter types), and who is a DOOM and FPS nut. I also live with a cat who turned up in our garden one day called Pixie (the cat, not the garden).                        </div>

<br/>
I'm Brittany. I am 21 years old and I live in Atlanta.<br/>
Started roleplaying freshman year of highschool, with a rock paper scissors version of D&amp;D. Did a lot of online roleplaying, in PbP threads. Played in a lot of one-shots, one BESM d20 campaign. Meet a group who was playing in Exalted, where I meet my gm who introduced me to indie games and Amber. <br/>
<br/>
Aside from the gaming: In school right now, and I'm all over the place in Atlanta (well, north half mostly). I like anime, video games, firefly, and lurking on the net.                        </div>

                            I'm Shannon, of the Riddle clan, Seattle branch. 26. By day I'm a video game user research engineer, so I play games and design, run, &amp; analyze studies to make them better. By night I suppose I just continue to be awesome, that's my super power. My academic background hits psychology (specifically cognitive neuroscience), minor in classical studies, MS in psycholinguistics, and additional grad work in user-centered design. Which my explain a lot of things. <br/><br/>I started gaming in 2003 when my now-hubby, Paul, introduced me to D&amp;D, and was introduced to indie games when I went to grad school in Edinburgh, decided to give the gaming society a try, was put in a Best Friends game hosted by Gregor Hutton where we all played strippers at the Pink Pony, and it was all over from there. I quite like to playtest games (what can I say, usability/UX to the core), but I have less than no desire to run games.<br/><br/>Paul &amp; I got married last August, so if you see people referring to a Shannon with the last name of East, that is also me. We have a dog named Chewy, who is the handsomest mutt ya ever did see, and pretty much the best dog in the world (verified by external sources). I'm in the Seattle Women's Chorus, which is a lesbian choir (but that wasn't part of the audition). And as the people who attended GoPlay NW this year can attest, I like to bake. I have a cooking/baking blog, <a href="http://www.doublethesugarblog.com" rel="nofollow">Double the Sugar</a>, and a personal blog with my ramblings on many a random thing, but don't get your hopes up because I don't talk about gaming all that much, at <a href="http://www.riddleof.com" rel="nofollow">The Riddle Of...</a> </div>

                            My name is Travis.  I'm an art historian specializing in religion, magic, and identity/community formation through visual and performative traditions in ancient Greece.<br>
<br>
But, really, I'm a gamer and have been for nearly my whole life.  I'm fascinated by rules and how manipulating these artificial limits can create a particular kind of experience.  For me, design matters a great deal, and I feel strongly that when I sit down to game, I want to go hard and fast and feel the rubber on the road.  I dig good narration, too, but I like it best when it has teeth, when I can feel the push and pull at the system level, and when it makes everybody want to keep coming back for more.<br>

Most importantly, I'm the husband of anansigirl, another one of the tribe around here.  She's super-rad.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

I'm a former student moving into recruitment and human resources (as fascinating as that is). I'm an avid writer, semi-decent artist and a frothing gamer. Currently I'me experimenting with different types of game, both playing and designing, in hopes of finding new, interesting ways to expand and develop the hobby. I'd like to try my hand at some story games and publish them online for the enjoyment of others.                        </br></br></div>

I'm was born and live in Uruguay, South America, and have 32 years old.My other nicks are Etsu Riot and Losstarot, my good side and my evil side, respectively. (Don't ask.) I started playing RPGs last year, in february, with a group of vereran people. (Star Wars D6.) In a weak, more or less, I was directing my own private World War II D6 version to two friends, and later to another friend, none of them experienced players (had not even heard about role-playing games before). Later, I tried with Cthulhu (with greate sessions of GUMSHOE) and eventually, I became a story gamer, thanks to Mouse Guard and Burning Wheel. And now, I am a follower of Luke Crane, Vincent Baker, John Wick and John Harper work, and I'm doing my own work too. Because my english sucks, I can't say much more. Sorry for that.                        </div>

                            I guess I should throw this up as well, being a good citizen and all that.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Jonathan Lavallee, and I'm 29 years old and I love long lingering looks over all amazing alliterations, especially entertained and engaged by amazing assonance.  I run Firestorm Ink, which currently has the line license to CyberGen and I've finally decided that I've had enough of just that and I'm putting out my own books of other stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I believe in the medieval method of creating art, which means that I work in IT to pay the bills and then do everything else on the side, much like many people who make games.  I just make myself feel better by saying that it's a very medieval style.  Chaucer was a customs clerk, right?  Right?<br/>
<br/>
I have a masters in English Literature, though I do want those years of my life back.  Learning to say, "Would you like fries with that" in Middle English isn't as fun as it sounds.  I have the mental and emotional scarring to prove it.<br/>
<br/>
There is poetry when the mood strikes me, and then there is a need to fix my prose so that it sounds less like my poetry.<br/>
<br/>
I love small short sentences.  I also apparently love commas.<br/>
<br/>
I'll probably not post very much, I tend to lurk in the shadows and then come out with something, possibly nonsensical, and then I return.                        </div>

                            OK, so I'm Marshall (there are two of us now, I guess I'm the other one...).  I'm 29 and getting closer to 30 than I would like.  I've got a wife who plays board games with me (score!) and a son who is an amazing wave of distruction.  I grew up in Oak Ridge, TN (...but don't glow in the dark) and now go to school in Boston; well, near Boston.  I've got a master's in experimental psychology and am currently working on my doctorate focusing on the nutritional neuroscience of aging.<br/><br/>My life has always been full of games.  It all started out with chess lessons from my grandfather.  A love of mythology got me and my friends into "pure" story telling games (no rules, all story) in elementary school and the games have just kept flowing from RPGs to CCGs, miniatures to Eurogames, year after year.  I played a lot of 3rd edition D&amp;D in college and slowly realized I just wasn't getting out of it all that I wanted and more or less gave up on RPGs.  Eight years later, here I am!  <br/><br/>In my free time (ha ha, I made a joke) I enjoy hiking, cycling, and the reading of a good old fashioned book.                        </div>

                            I'm Erlend Bruer and i've been lurking on and off for a few years. I've suddenly decided to spend more time on internet forums (yay!), so I thought I'd introduce myself :) <br/>
<br/>
I've been playing roleplaying games since I was a kid, and have been designing games the past five or six years. I'm generally interested in making and playing games that cross the borders between real life and fiction, whether it is through using roles that are just people in the real world, stories that somehow reflect on the players' lives or through using small parts of the player's lives directly in the games. I do play lots of other stuff too, though, currently got a Burning Wheel/Ravenloft campaign going, for instance. <br/>
<br/>
Umm what else? I finished a master's degree in social psychology this summer, and am generally active in a few norwegian NGOs, some related to gaming and some not. Doing as much writing and volunteer work as I can this fall while waiting for some job or other to turn up. Love to play the guitar. Am also fighting a growing Starcraft 2 addiction...                        </div>

                            I'm Pete. I started gaming when I was five and stumbled across some D&amp;D dice on the path near my house; I'm 31 now, and still haven't looked back once. I started doing freelance game writing back when I was 16, at the old Star Wars Adventure Journal, and ran around some hotels testing their LARP rules with a blaster pistol and a lot of enthusiasm. A couple years later, I lucked into a gig with White Wolf. I stayed with them for about 10 years, working mostly for the Mind's Eye Theatre line, where for my sins I was eventually made developer. I left the company a few years ago to attend graduate school, and now I'm an English professor, though the game design itch is rising again, so it probably won't be long before I get back into it.<br/>
<br/>
I'm a LARP dilettante - I've tried all the big systems, most of the little ones and a half-dozen boffer games besides - and an MMO nomad. I'm a laid back 40K wargamer, an avid Fantasy Flight board game lover and a fan of many geek card games. At the tabletop, I'm equally at home throwing down in a hardcore Pathfinder dungeon crawl or as a Dog walking the plains, and I browse game rules like most people browse Ferrari dealerships - even if I know I'll never actually play with it, I still appreciate the craftsmanship, and love peeking under the hood. I'm a gaming pusher, and love teaching my friends new games.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, I'm married to the best wife ever, a snazzy dancer and almost always barefoot.                        </div>

                            Hi,   I'm Paul 44 live UK Devon married to the right one with three beautiful daughters, Yes four women!!! this ant why I like gaming, luckily they all get on well.<br/>
<br/>
Gaming for me has been a great social thing. I have gamed for the last 14 years regularly at my home in the gaming shed 5-4 mtrs with pot belly stove and hot tea.<br/>
For the last five years or so I've been trying to introduce more indie story driven games with some success in our group, gaming shows over here locally are War gaming events mainly so the indie wave is just a ripple on this side of the world. Unless someone knows different?<br/>
I work for a boat building company, I'm not greatly academic but have an enthusiasm for art and the imagination.<br/>
I like walking coastal paths and Dartmoor with its prehistoric sites.<br/>
I like siting by my garden fire bear, family and good food. Yum                        </div>

                            I'm Montaigne Jean-Patrick Bouvart (it's Franco-Irish, I can't help it if it's fancy). I'm 33 years old, a freelance scholar, and happily married to a working artist. We have two cats, both adopted, both insane, that provide endless amusement. We live on the top floor of a Victorian house with non-Euclidean walls and cupboards, and I smoke pipes somewhat incessantly. I have degrees in comparative religion and English literature, which pretty much turned me into an agnostic Taoist utilitarian. <br>
<br>
I've been gaming for over 20 years (grasps walker/zimmerframe, wheezes), and have played most major, minor, and indie systems. I love them all in their own way, and I have a library of about 300 game-books and twice as many gaming mags to prove it.<br>
<br>
Grew up in a rusty steel town that was circling the drain of existence near Pittsburgh, and now live in a happening little town of artists and nutters outside of Philadelphia. I enjoy riding on trains, but rarely get the chance to do so, and am continually disappointed that, despite my superb inductive and deductive reasoning, no one ever asks me to solve a murder. I'm a serious Deadhead, a non-serious leftist-anarchist, and a downright laughable ordained minister in three faiths. <br>

Hoping to learn Latin this year, but aware that that seems unlikely.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            My name is David.<br/>
<br/>
I am from Seattle, Washington, near the University District. I am a student, I am on a varsity rowing team, and I love the Emerald City. I've been running and playing freeform, minimal-rules storytelling games all my life, with a focus on whatever concept the group finds interesting on a given night (in addition to some D&amp;D and GURPS). I am smitten with IRC pickup games and I hope to find many players on Story Games. I want to learn as much as I can! My current focus is on the streamlining of RPG rules to make for very fast play, while losing as little sophistication as possible. It is a fascinating balancing act. <br/>
<br/>
If you'd like to play IRC games in any setting, let me know at any time : D I am very glad to have found this site.<br/>

I want to run Trail of Cthulhu, play Fiasco, and try out Apocalypse world.<br/>

<br/>
Thought I'd better add a quick note about me.<br/>
My name's Andy Peregrine, and my proper job is as a lighting technician in a West End theatre in london.<br/>
I do a bit of freelance writing for games, and I've been really lucky with the projects I've worked on.<br/>
I run Victoriana for Cubicle 7, but I produce games for me under my label 'Corone Design'.<br/>
<br/>
My favourite game of all time is 7th Sea,<br/>
but Vampire the Masquerade found me many of my best friends when I started the UK Camarilla a long time ago.<br/>
I really wish I had more time to play Nobilis too.                        </div>

                            Hi all!<br/>
<br/>
There is no real me - I had it surgically removed.*<br/>
<br/>
Actually I'm Adam Dickstein, 41, living in the greatest city in the world, New York, NY. I work with dogs, including training. I am also a freelance writer and artist whose worked on and off in the Comic Book and RPG industries for 20 years.<br/>
<br/>
I am divorced but still great friends with my ex who is one of the best RPG gamers I've ever met. Which means I'm available (Laaadiees *wink* - kidding. I am only half that obnoxious). <br/>
<br/>
In addition to gaming I enjoy comic books, anime/manga, sci-fi, folklore and mythology, movies, very little television that isn't British, cooking, walking around the city, real science and history. My best friend is my dog, Delilah, a three year old Catahoula Leopard Dog mix.<br/>
<br/>
I try to play anything and everything at least once. Favorite games of all time include Ars Magica, Champions (4th Edition), Faery's Tale Deluxe, InSpectres, Mekton (preference for Mekton II), Mutants &amp; Masterminds, Star Trek (FASA and Last Unicorn Games versions), Star Wars (West End Games D6) and Teenagers from Outer Space. Want so bad to get a hold of Bliss Stage, Fiasco and Meikyuu Kingdom and Yuuyake Koyake (both from Japan).<br/>
<br/>
I currently run a fantasy rpg campaign best described as D&amp;D-for-those-people-who-hate-D&amp;D. With the new year I will probably be adding a second game to my roster in addition to playtesting my own creation.<br/>
<br/>
Yes gang, I am currently, after 33+ years in the hobby, preparing to publish my own RPG. More on that as I fail to realize how crazy I am.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Adam<br/>

                            Hey all,<br/><br/>I'm Peter Olsen, a 28 year old geek living and working in Albany, NY. I'm of Norwegian and Italian descent (Nortalian? Iwegian?) - my father was a second-generation Norwegian and my mother is a second-generation Italian. I grew up listening to countless stories from my grandfather Bjarne, passed to him by his parents. I guess you could say that storytelling has been in my blood for a while now.<br/><br/>I'm a Senior Food Bacteriologist employed by the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets. My job responsibilities primarily consist of the detection, isolation, identification, characterization, and subtyping of certain bacterial pathogens - <i>E. coli</i> O157:H7, various STEC's, <i>Salmonella</i> spp.. and <i>Campylobacter</i>spp., as well as other microbes as the situation warrants - in all sorts of food samples from across the state. We can test - and probably have tested - nearly any type of food bought, sold, produced, distributed, or consumed in the entire state, with the notable exception of restaurants. Besides testing, we're also an ISO 17025 accredited laboratory, which means that my job also consists of developing, implementing, and auditing various Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's), as well as training and supervising laboratory staff in the performance of said procedures.<br/><br/>In short, I keep your food from killing you. You're welcome.<br/><br/>When I'm not saving the world from deadly microbes, I can be found playing video games (damn you Steam and the ease with which I can spend too much money), playing board games/card games/dice games/many other sorts of games, brewing beer (all-grain, naturally), listening to the most abrasive and obnoxious heavy metal music produced by humans (mmm, delicious post-black noise-infused doom), and playing around in the SCA pretending to be an 11th-century Viking named Magnus the Stout - a brewer and storyteller extraordinaire.<br/><br/>And, of course, I play pen-and-paper roleplaying games.<br/><br/>Like many gamers, I started off with AD&amp;D 2nd edition as my gateway drug. Well, OK, technically the board game <i>Dragon Strike</i> was my introduction to roleplaying, but D&amp;D is where it really took off. I spent many a summer putting together encounters for my party, taking them on all sorts of adventures across Faerun. Good times were had by all.<br/><br/>One day, in 2007 I believe, I went with my good friends Rym and Scott of <a href="http://frontrowcrew.com/" rel="nofollow">Geeknights</a> "fame" to this convention called Ubercon, out in New Jersey somewhere. That proved to be a fateful trip, because there, the three of us sat down to play this little demo called "The Sword" for some game called <i>Burning Wheel.</i> The rest, as they say, is history.<br/><br/>My introduction to story games completely annihilated my desire to play D&amp;D, and since then, I've been playing Burning Wheel pretty steadily. More recently, in the past 1.5 years, I've added other story games to my repertoire - Lacuna, Dread, 1001 Nights, and InSpectres to name a few - and I'm loving them more and more. I've recently restarted GM'ing, running a weekly Burning THAC0-style Burning Wheel game.<br/><br/>Very very recently, I ran a session of Danger Patrol!, as it looked super fun and neat. Having plumbed the depths of obscure story RPG's, I figured it was time to up and join a forum of similarly hopelessly dedicated nerds, to better direct and develop my inner storytelling nerd. I'm looking forward to reading and participating in many discussions, to learn from and teach other GM's.                        </div>

                            Howdy, all.<br/>
<br/>
I'm Jim Sweeney, 27, hailing from Fort Wayne, IN, two hours (and 6-7 months, currently) northeast of Gencon.  While I head back to IPFW for my accounting certification, I'm working part-time at Clem's, a local game shop, making sure we try to get some of the cool new RPGs in between wrangling Yu-Gi-Oh players.<br/>
<br/>
I've been gaming since middle school, and don't plan on stopping any time soon.  My friend, Chris, helped guide me toward the wonder of games off the beaten WotC path (as well as to this site), and it is indeed a marvelous thing.  I'm currently playing one Dresden Files game and have two on hiatus, playing in a D&amp;D4E game and a sporadic Gamma World game, trying to get a critical mass of people interested in Apocalypse World, and carrying around my Fiaco binder just in case.<br/>
<br/>
RPGs do not plumb the depth of my geekery, which also includes comics, board games, novels, filking... the list goes on.<br/>
<br/>
Happy to meet all of you!                        </div>

                            Hey, all.<br/><br/>My name's Chris and I live in Vancouver, BC. I'm a <a href="http://www.theg33k.com" rel="nofollow">freelance writer and editor</a>, and I've recently started publishing some <a href="http://hoodieripper.tumblr.com" rel="nofollow">punk romance stories</a>. That's the interesting stuff, such as it is.<br/><br/>I've been playing RPGs since I got my first set of AD&amp;D books at 9 (which was, god, nearly 30 years ago). Since then I've played an assload of games and worked in an assload of game stores, but I've recently gotten into story games in a big way. They're kind of revolutionary to me in how they're the way I thought that RPGs should be but pretty much never were.<br/><br/>Oh, I also game with skinnyghost; he's running the Apocalypse World campaign I'm currently embroiled in. We've been geeky comrades-in-arms for several years now and I owe him a personal debt of thanks for introducing me to indie RPGs. So thanks, yo.                        </div>

                            Hi all!<br/>
<br/>
I'm Matteo, I'm Italian and I currently live in Lucca, home of <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://lucca2010.luccacomicsandgames.com/index.php?id=279" rel="nofollow">Lucca Comics&amp;Games</a>, one of the biggest C&amp;G conventions in Europe - my house's across the Games section street.<br/>
I'm 24 (well, 25 in a few days) and, after having moved a couple of times to different cities and having learned how to make a proper pizza and how to manage a restaurant, I decided to return back to my studies - I left my Literature courses at 21 - and now I'm an in-training web designer, and aiming to get a degree in Computational and Language Science.<br/>
<br/>
I love to travel and I have seen a big part of Europe, and a little of Africa. I hope to go to the US in the next couple of years, if the occasion arises, but mostly I'd like to visit Asia, particularly Cambodia and India.<br/>
I think I know most of the story-gamers in Italy, and a few of the internationals too. I'm currently loving and enjoying really much Apocalypse World (but then, I'm not original here: who doesn't?)<br/>
<br/>
So... Se you all!                        </div>

I do have a boyfriend, who's a pretty awesome guy. We coordinate our outfits 9 times out of 10. I enjoy all things that are diabetic friendly, fun, awesome, cuddly, cute, BADASS, or just down right rude loud and hilarious. I'm often very sarcastic and I try to take things as lightly as possible.                        </br></br></div>

                            G'day Folks,<br>
My name is Nathan, but my friends call me Noofy. I'm 39, a paramagic and love telling stories. My colleagues vaguely put up with what they see as 'quirky' behaviour. After playing rpgs since the early 80's, I had a long hiatus after Uni and sorta only played boardgames for a long while. I stumbled across the forge and story games and then Burning Wheel. The rest is history.<br>
<br>
I love protagonist driven games and fantasy is my preferred genre (though my long suffering partner often wishes for some old school railroady CoC sometimes (poor dear), and we have been playing an awful lot of AW lately.<br>
<br>
I love food, surfing, tattoos (getting and giving), skydiving and moutain biking, though not necessarily in any order. <br>
<br/>
Happy to meet you all and hopefully game face to face sometime!                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            I've been posting for a week or so now, so I should probably post something here.<br/><br/>My name is William. I'm 26.<br/><br/>I'm a 5th generation American, descended primarily from German immigrants and a Czechoslovakian draft dodger. I live in the frozen wastes of Northern New York, about an hour south of Montreal and several hundred miles north of anything interesting. I have a degree in English and political science with a minor in psychology. I did a year of graduate work in English Lit before deciding that I wanted nothing more to do with academia. I'm now working (miserably) part time as a substitute teacher while I look (desperately) for something less awful.<br/><br/>I began playing RPGs at 12 years old when I received <i>Dragon Strike</i> for Christmas. I played <i>D&amp;D</i> for several years, and messed around with <i>Demon: the Fallen</i>, <i>GURPS</i> and other mainstream titles. A long time friend and member of my gaming group introduced me to indie RPGs and game design a few years ago. <br/><br/>I have a bad habit of refusing to actual put my games in writing. I justify this by saying that if I cannot explain a game in five minutes at the table before play, and if I cannot hold all the rules in my head during play, then my game design is too obtuse and unintuitive. In reality, I'm just lazy. I've tried to break this habit recent. Last month I participated in The Forge's Ronnies game design competition, and I'm currently mulling expanding my entry, <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/48430111/Danse-Macabre" rel="nofollow">Danse Macabre</a>, into a full, self-published game.<br/><br/>I've always been terrible at conclusions, so, uh ...

Hi! I'm Ally Nauss (and am finally not using a psuedonymn, but I sporadically used to lurk/post on the BW forums as"allywiththeface" and on KF as "karschael" for those of you who may frequent said places). I am 24 and live in Philly with my long-term manly man Don (who usually posts on any of these gaming-type forums as eruditus). I have a nearly-two-year old daughter, a Rottweiler named Morgan who weighs as much as I do, and a little mutt named Duncan. I like parentheses too much. <br/>
<br/>
I work as a sales coordinator for a hotel, though I went to college for therapeutic recreation. <br/>
<br/>
My interest are very ecclectic. I tend to lose interest in things very quickly, so I bounce around from hobby to hobby as my brain sees fit. I enjoy cooking, and do this the most often, as eating is one of those more necessary habits. I enjoy gaming, and do so between 1-a billion times per week. I may have a tendency to exaggerate from time to time. I blame this on never caring enough about arithmetic and instead choosing numbers at random to express myself. I also knit, pretend to practice Win Chung and other martial arts, drink a whole lot of beer and wine while using snobbish terms like "mouthfeel", "pithy", and "finish ( Okay, that last one wasn't snobbish, but in context one can sound like they know what they are talking about.), and use both fragments and run-on sentences incessantly. I am addicted to cynicism and sarcasm. This has made my life difficult in the past, but I'll take my d4 of trouble and roll with it. (Yes, that pun was intended. Yes, you may punch me for it)<br/>
<br/>
I recently designed my first game ever, not counting anything I "designed" under the age of six. It is not awesome. Yet. But it will be... (ish?)<br/>
<br/>
I'm an open book. If you have questions, just let me know.                        </div>

                            Hi, all,<br/>
<br/>
Andrew here. Tragically, I am ancient, and have never grown out of games. My first contact with RPGs was in a wargaming magazine (Battle - for Wargamers, nineteen seventy-something) that talked about a brand new invention called Dungeons and Dragons. It was still 3 little books then and so weird that no one really new how to describe it. I wrote my first system then, using a d6 for everything. It was crap. Then (1st ed) AD&amp;D came out, and I started for real. Then Runequest, then Gamma World, and so on. <br/>
<br/>
Over the years I have gone through phases of collecting every RPG system, and then contracting the collection to only those that I 'really love'. This is especially necessary now as there are so many great products out there. And this sharing of ideas over the internet makes 'ownership' not really the same thing it was in years past.<br/>
<br/>
Now days I do not play classical role-playing games at all. I really don't have much interest or patience in complex 'rules', or the minutiae of someone's very-clever system. Instead I create story-telling games in a free form style. It suits where I'm at. This is where I put them, if anyone is interested: http://shichitenhakki.wordpress.com/ <br/>
<br/>
Good gaming everyone.<br/>

I'm a 48-year old dad of two, husband, 20 year designer and creative director, typographer, artist, game developer, thinker, leftist, environmentalist, atheist, reader, cat lover (I have three), wargamer (WW2 tactical), board gamer, klutz, and narrativist/indie/unique mechanic RPG fan. I have a slightly giggly 13-year-old girl trapped inside me and my wife insists that my real name should be "He Who Makes Short Story Long". Currently ensconced in the southern Ontario city of Waterloo, but have lived and worked in San Francisco, Vancouver, Phoenix, the Caribbean, Europe and Toronto. Was that too much?<br/>
<br/>
I make games for iOS as a hobby to "relax" when I have the time, but after my first seven games I've slowed down quite a bit. Glacial development times now, but I've got one almost done and one in progress that will most likely see the light of day.<br/>
<br/>
I don't have as much time to RPG as I used to. My RPGing goes all the way back to the 4th version of the D&amp;D white box set I received back in December of 1975 (birthday gift I begged my parents for). I managed to get both Dave Arneson and Gary Gygax to sign it at some convention or another then gave it away in a moment of madness. I gave away one of ten Yosef Karsh studio print autographed photos of Rush too, and sold my Apple stock at $17/share so this will show you what foresight and planning I am capable of.<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, RPGs. I own the utterly fantastic A Taste for Murder, though have only managed one play (time, lack of mature RPGers nearby etc). I have Cats, High Flying Beatrice, Mortal Coil, Mouse Guard, PtA, Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen, Wushu Open Reloaded, and a handful of others that escape me right now. I'm hoping to discover more, maybe find some local older players to RPG with, discuss the best in indie-narrativist-unique mechanic RPGs that are appearing, and generally contribute as I can.<br/>
<br/>
Final thoughts: Thanks Graham W for the fantastic A Taste for Murder. And does anyone know of a gritty, narrativist WW2 RPG (or a system that can be adapted to that setting) that's short, unique and story-driven? Not Godlike without powers, something more unique that will give me a band of Brothers type story in a relatively short evening of play?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, and hi!<br/>
<br/>
P.S. My oldest is a hard core 4th edition D&amp;D player. I can't even look at the books anymore without cringing at the terrible size/density and yet having a pang of nostalgia. My youngest is a gamer too. Lucky me!                        </div>

                            Time for an update.  I suppose I'm not the same person I was... geez, five years ago?  
<blockquote>Chris Goodwin, age <span style="color: #FF0000;">40</span> (41 in less than a week?!). Married to Lisa, we have a <span style="color: #FF0000;">nine</span> year old, Andrew.</blockquote>
I live in the boonies of Hillsboro, Oregon, and work (currently) as a software tester at a very large company that makes computer chips.  I've been a perma-temp for most of my adult life, with a couple of exceptions here and there.  My wife and I have been going to GameStorm for at least four of the last five years, and we've taken our son for the past two.  I am pretty bad about making it across town for gaming but will endeavor to be better about it in the future.  Maybe this will be the year I try to get something regular going on this side...<br/><br/>Christian and I are evil twins, born exactly seven years apart and on different continents.  <br/><br/>I'm trying to be much less of a dick online than I used to be.  I've been a Hero System snob and an indie games snob, and no game, no matter how awesome it is, is worth being a dick over.  If I refuse to play a game anymore, it will be because I've tried it and didn't enjoy it, and for no other reason.  I still love me some "indie" games and some Hero System and every so often some D&amp;D and other "trad" games, and board and card games and... and....  I have gamer ADD, which I attribute to also having regular ADD; I go through phases where I am intensely into one game, system, or setting for a few days to a month or two, then get distracted by the next squirrel.  I call it the "wheel of ADD" -- round and round it goes, where it stops nobody knows.                        </div>

                            Hi All!<br/><br/>I'm Tori from Seattle, WA. 30 years old, and I live with 3 roommates, 3 cats, and 3 chickens . I currently work at 2 different bars as primarily a bookkeeper, but I also do prep cooking, run a karaoke night and a movie night, with the occasional hosting of Bingo thrown in.<br/><br/>I am part of a non profit urban farming collective that runs two mini farms in Seattle, and all the food grown goes to the volunteers who work it and local food banks. We do all our produce deliveries by bike.<br/><br/>I am in a ridiculous band called Adult Contemporary in which we mash up awful adult smooth rock songs from the 90s and attempt to make them danceable (emphasis on attempt!) <br/><br/>A lot of my time now is focused on our RPG podcast, <a href="http://www.selfcriticalhits.com/" rel="nofollow">Self Critical Hits</a>, which got started back in October and is (in my mind) slowly but steadily improving (fingers crossed!). I am trying to create a new side project of the podcast that feature folks using "nerdy" habits to build community and foster relationships. So interviewing folks who run cons, or start sci fi book clubs, or run public games- etc. If you have any ideas, please send them my way!! We want to highlight Pacific Northwest folks specifically.<br/><br/>The folks I podcast with are pretty much the only people I've ever gamed with, so my goal for this year is to game with some other people, mainly to get perspective, but also to connect to our community and make friends! <br/><br/>I only started gaming about 6 years ago- so I've mainly played a lot of D&amp;D 3.5 and CoC, but this last year or so we've been focusing more on indie games, including Dogs in the Vineyard, Apocalypse World, Fiasco, Burning Wheel/Burning Empire, Everyone is John, and Drifters Escape- Drifters, Dogs, and Burning Wheel being my favorite so far. <br/><br/>I feel pretty late to the table with indie games so I predict a lot of new games being purchased, played, and podcast in the next few months. Also, it seems Washington is having basically a con-a-month from June- October, and I will be doing my damnedest to be at all of them.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>Tori                        </div>

I am Antoine Boegli, currently 40 years old, single, roleplayer, publisher, larper, writer, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Living in Switzerland (where I was born) I am a IT system security specialist or something like that, and I've been roleplaying since 1984. Also, I have written a bunch of totally imperfect systems, and around 1995, I've fallen in love with the minimalistic kind of rules sported/sproutted by games like Over the Edge, Amber, etc. I am also know for being the publisher of the French version of Nobilis (second edition, the GWB) and of some other French-only games. Currently, after helping the translation française of Archipelago II, I am working on my own theory about rpg, and trying to put that in pratice with a new game system.                        </div>

                            Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
I'm Shane Mclean, 34-year old, married with two young girls, a soldier (medical corps) by employment, and a geek by choice.<br/>
<br/>
I live in Asia, in Brunei on the island of Borneo, where we still have a base. It's a nice, hot, sunny and rainy place that, unfortunately, I am rotating away from soon *sigh*. By way of hobbies I enjoy (aside from gaming) judo, badminton, computer games, and I present a breakfast show on british forces radio every weekend. Luckily, and like many other folks to post before me, my wife shares my gaming hobby, so I get to game every week without fail. I also do demo games at conventions for Esdevium, the UK's main distributor, and Triple Ace Games. I stumbled over to storygames after flirting with indie games over the last few years.<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>

                            I'm Christopher Grau. 24 in one week, moving in with my girlfriend (board and video games) sometime this summer. Born and raised in Northern New Jersey, USA (with a brief stint in Georgia).<br>
<br>
I work as a legal assistant at a tax controversy law firm in Northern NJ while I study for the Enrolled Agent exam.<br>
<br>
I grew up mostly on a mix of Alternity, poorly explained AD&amp;D, D&amp;D 3.0, and the Old World of Darkness. I left gaming for a while in college, picked it up again with 4e, was introduced to indie games by Brendan C. (he's hanging around here somewhere), who was my DM back in elementary school through high school, and have now pretty much abandoned 4e. I now subsist on a steady diet of Apocalypse World and whatever Brennan throws at our indie group.<br>
<br>
Some random facts:<br>
I used to play WoW, but I'm better now<br>
I start 10 RPG projects and finish 1<br/>
I owned and painted a small Space Marine army and never used it<br/>
I lived in Japan and failed at learning the language<br/>
The DC metro area needs more FLGS's<br/>
I play the Violin, Viola, Clarinet, Alto Clarinet, Timpani, and sing Bass                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

I'm 21 years old (almost 22) and I've spent 11 of it gaming. Admittedly, up until recently my gaming experience has been fairly mainstream (D&amp;D, White Wolf) I've recently been turned on to indie games through this site and a friend of mine, and I'm trying to play catch-up on the lingo and game canon. I'm now attempting to find a group to play some of these "crazy, hippie-dippy games" I keep finding.<br/>

                            Hi, my name is Dan Luxenberg and I'm an avid gamer of all types (I started roleplaying back with the white box D&amp;D set). I think I have either played or read almost every game that has been published and now I'm working my way through all the indie games I can get my hands on. My current favorites are ( in no particular order ) Apocalypse World, Spirit of the Century, Fiasco, and the somewhat more mainstream Leverage rpg.<br/>
<br/>
I'm 48 and my wife and I live in the greater Washington DC area where I work as a 'web and social media' guy.<br/>
<br/>
Hobby wise, aside from RPGs I am a big Euro board gamer.  I also love me some PC/xbox/ps3 gaming and all the usual geeky things like scifi, comics and tech. I am also a magician- close up being my main focus.                        </div>

                            I'm Ville Halonen, born in 1980, started roleplaying in 1990, I guess, with the red box.<br/><br/>I have two kids (girl born 2008, boy 2010), I try to write my master's thesis on Guy Debord's theory of the spectacle, and I work at the help desk of a large Finnish internet service provider. I used to dream about being a researcher of philosophy, then I thought of not doing it, and I dream of it again so I could leave the ISP and focus on thinking and writing. We also have a border terrier called Hugo. <br/><br/>I'm a vegetarian since 1999 and although I occasionally buy food that has milk in it, I haven't cooked a non-vegan meal since 2003. I'm not militant about it.<br/><br/>When I have the time to do anything but the above, I read all sorts of books and read and play roleplaying games, which hugely influence the other stuff I read. I also listen to music and watch movies and select tv shows (The Wire, Babylon 5, and The Prisoner stand out as favourites), but I've given up computer games for RPGs.                        </div>

I've been role-playing since the age of 16. I've played around with designing games for some time but finally I have a game (called Project Dreamland) which is actually undergoing serious playtesting and I'm intending to eventually publish it.<br/>
I've translated Don't Rest Your Head to Hebrew and am doing my best selling it.<br/>
I'm quite active at conventions (we've got quite a lot of those around), running games and organising stuff.<br/>
I also write a column on game mechanics on RPG.net, together with a good friend of mine.<br/>

I enjoy music, mostly metal and rock, but also classical music on occasion. I love movies and books. I also write stuff, but as of yet none of it has been published (I keep trying, though).                        </div>

                            Hi, <br>
<br>
I'm Andreas, I am a happy 28-year-old Norwegian. I live in Oslo. It rains a lot in the summer, and in winter we get an equal amount of snow. Mind you, it's not all sleet and rain. <br>
I am a journalist by education and interest, and a software licensing specialist by trade. I actually quite enjoy it, but they pay is irregular, to say the least. I used to write about mobile phones and communication, but that line of work dried up once people started buying iPhones. If I had my way I'd find a job writing about technology, but there aren't many of those jobs going. <br>
<br>
I used to play in bands, and I miss that, but my band mates had kids and thus cannot find the time to jump around on stages. We released some EPs, and it was all good fun. <br>
<br>
I've played roleplaying games since I was 11 or so, starting out with the D&amp;D Rules Cyclopedia. We consequently played every version of D&amp;D up to 3.5. <br>
My favourite game ever was a Cyberpunk 2020 campaign based on Twin Peaks. It was awesome, and I played a hardboiled investigator! <br/>
Lately we've been playing PTA and Burning Wheel, as well as some other things. <br/>
<br/>
I've designed a game set in Oslo, about fifty years into the future. It started out as an idea of jumping off high buildings, but ended up as a game built on relationships and strong emotions. Also, there was violence. It was fun. <br/>
<br/>
I also work on a game I call Heartlands, which is about riding across a beautiful continent, looking for a home inbetween ancient ruins and small holdings.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I'm Evan Torner, a Ph.D. candidate in his late 20s soon to defend his dissertation in German Studies and Film Studies.  My home is in western Massachusetts, where I live with avid role-player and Internet recluse Kat Jones.<br/>
<br/>
I played "pretend" until I was 8, and have been role-playing since then.  My first system was the Marvel Advanced Set, and from there I have waded through dozens upon dozens of different systems – Cyberpunk 2020, Street Fighter, Traveler, Werewolf, Amber, Rifts, In Nomine, AD&amp;D, Unknown Armies, Riddle of Steel.  Conventions are my bread and butter; I run one-shots there like nobody's business.  I am a regular at Origins in Columbus, OH, though I also help run JiffyCon with Kat, Emily Care Boss and Julia Ellingboe.<br/>
<br/>
Bill White and I are currently editing a multi-contributor volume tentatively titled Immersive Gameplay which is under contract with McFarland Press in 2012.  The volume looks at discourses of principles of game immersion across role-playing games, reality television, and video games.<br/>
<br/>
I think I know many of you.                        </div>

                            I'm James Stein, a long-time lurker here and on the forge. I'm now 25, recently having finished my BS in Biology in NY and in just a month or so I'll be moving to Boston to start my Master's in Public Health (concentration in Biostatistics) at BU. The plan for after being the PhD, and I really wish I'd done a hell of a lot more math in my undergrad time so that I didn't have to do an MS as a prereq to the PhD. For the past few years I've just been doing research in a breast cancer lab (I'm not upset at the fact that people are trying to break our current theory of metastasis: I thought it was pretty fuckin' weak myself).<br/><br/>I got into RPGs at the age of 8 or 9, when I got my first unsupervised computer and AOL account. I think the AOL freeform chat rooms were called Rhy'Din? I remember being excessively enamored of standing around pretending to be a dragon in a tavern. I soon got onto UseNet contributing to fiction (alt.dragons-inn), and basically by age ten I was writing on the order of 20 pgs/day and had completely merged "RP" with "writing." They stayed merged for well over a decade.<br/><br/>I was not a geek in HS. I was well-known for being a funny slacker. I woke up in my senior year of HS, when I came down with nasty immunological problems, nearly died, and realized "Holy fuck, this is my life - I need to get crackin' on not wasting it!" My GPA went to 4.0, and my social life went to 0.0. I may have overdone it. It took a few years (and a BS in Biology) to realize that those immunological problems weren't going to allow me a career in medicine, and that I'm not sure I want to be an MD anyway ((a) partly rationalization, (b) medicine is kind of boring; they don't get to solve any really awesome problems, (C) Biochemistry's fucking awesome!). I had a torrid, blouse-tearing affair with biochemistry before I realized that with my health problems I can't be a biochemist either. I settled on Biostats as allowing me to continue to do awesome medical research but without being quantitatively stupid and allowing for working from home when ill.<br/><br/>Every wall in every room of my house not occupied by door or window is covered with bookshelves. I am not unhappy with this state of affairs.<br/><br/>I have 3 nieces. They have been brainwashed into thinking science is the bees knees (and it damn well is, in no part due to the fact that I show them how to make simple things go boom.) This is not unrelated to the deafness I have in my left ear (I really thought that CO2 gas pressure would blow the cap off the soda bottle. The cap started to blow, and then stopped hissing, and then the bottle went boom. I decided to get between it and my nieces and suffered for the choice. It was the right choice.) I have snuck over 40 pounds of dry ice out of a laser physics lab to dump into my niece's in-ground pool for her birthday party. The entire backyard was covered in fog and the pool bubbled for ages. I'm the best uncle. <br/><br/>In HS I wrote ~40-100 pg/day with my then-gf, until she died suddenly (car accident.) I have not written for pleasure since.<br/><br/>I am willing to spend 10 hours  and upwards of 40 dollars making BBQ sauce from scratch. I am unwilling to eat fish.<br/><br/>I was born an atheist (seriously, you can ask my 2nd grade hebrew school teacher). I find the religious worldview completely, utterly, baffling. It took many years of growth and maturation before I could begin to understand that religious folks are actually religious, and not just using 'god' as a metaphor for other shit (like I did when I was a kid, and hadn't realized I was an atheist yet). I still can't honestly put myself in their shoes, and have to consciously remind myself that when people couch things in religious terms that they're not just being disingenuous - they may be sincerely expressing a world view. This may be my parents fault for letting me get at Greek and Norse mythology before introducing me to hebrew school and synagogue. Once you've gone through Edith Hamilton (with the stipulation it's just fiction), it's hard to take the next set of myths as Serious Facts.<br/><br/>I've only ever lived in Brooklyn NY and then Staten Island NY. I'm a 5-boro hermit crab.<br/><br/>My only professional occupation is tutoring (college maths, biology, chemistry). Other than my willful wandering in this post, it turns out I'm generally pretty good at teaching people difficult stuff. I will gladly give this up to become a biostatistician. <br/><br/>I have never played a face-to-face RPG in my life. I wish I had, and if I were less shy, I'd go to a con and do so.                        </div>

                            Hi!<br/><br/>I'm Brad. I'm almost 25 and currently live in Chicago, though I grew up in California and hope to move back some day. Right now I'm a software engineer for a company out in the 'burbs, but I'm actually looking into changing careers and going to culinary school instead. I like 80's glam metal, and 00's girlpop. I used to drive an '87 el camino, but donated it to charity at the end of last year.<br/><br/>I was introduced to video games at a very young age, having "been released" (so to speak) only <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">a few years before</span> a year after the US NES release. Freshman year of high school, I was introduced to both WarHammer and D&amp;D, and we played them both pretty similarly -- primarily as a combat simulator, with a bit of fun narrative thrown around to make things more exciting.<br/><br/>Then I came across InSpectres one day. It was my first introduction to real roleplaying, and to this day continues to be my favorite game. I own many more games than I've actually played, but I'm working on fixing that (just putting together a group to try out Apocalypse World in a few weeks!).<br/><br/>The majority of my gaming experience is with d&amp;d and world of darkness, which are both great, but I really love the less-structured smaller games more.                        </div>

                            Howdy, y'all.<br/>
<br/>
I'm Henry, a 23-year-old College Grad from Canada. <br/>
<br/>
I've been playing D&amp;D since 2nd Ed, but dabbled with GURPS and other systems like that until I got into college and things really got rolling. Traveller, Savage Worlds, Spirit of the Century, Shadow of Yesterday, Burning Wheel, FATE (the Dresden Files version, specifically), Apocalypse World, Microscope... Haven't had more'n one game in the last five years last ten or more sessions, irritatingly, but a lot of fun all the same.<br/>
<br/>
Definitely want to play and learn more! Excited to be here.<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Feel like adding some more...<br/>
<br/>
I'm an Alberta boy, born and bred, but living in the Pacific Northwest and finding I quite like it out here. Went to college down in the States, not sure at all what I'll be doing now. All my passions pay terribly, writing, acting, and I'm not sure about going professional in either, and that's not a cocky thing, uncertainty as to whether or not I COULD is a big part of that.<br/>
<br/>
Hoping to design a game someday. Have a few ideas, but nothing worth talking about yet, alas. It's just a goal.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I love the Ancient World and history spanning the whole length and breadth of human history. I can translate Ancient Greek kind of okay, but I'm not where I want to be with that just yet.                        </div>

                            Hola!<br/><br/>I'm Paulo Rivas, a 33-year-old peruvian comic artist/editor/designer/publisher. You know, Peru? somewhere in South America? You've got to visit us some day, our food might not be the best but our way of cooking it IS superb.<br/><br/>I started roleplaying in my twenties and find it the most amusing activity a group of creative people can make. It all started with Vampire the Masquerade and pretty soon I was hacking ol' Paladium's Robotech to GM a campaign of my own. Ok I also hacked the Argentina module but it was almost unrecognizable when I finished with it. Sinde then I tried D&amp;D which went good for a while until our GM ruined the fun, which made me prone to try and hack any other RPG that I run into.<br/><br/>I'm currently working full time as a graphic designer, and creating my own comic publishing company, probably the first in Peru since the 90's. Of course, I would love to sell RPGs here too, however we must start with the simplest ones, since people here doesn't have the smallest clue what are tabletop RPGs about.                        </div>

<p>I'm Ilan Muskat. I'm 32, and I work for the Ontario Public Service as a project manager and analyst in information technology.</p>
<p>I live in Toronto, which is a big and culturally bewildering metropolis.  It gets cold here sometimes, so there's sometimes a muted tone to the street life. In the summer it is pretty vivid.</p>
<p>That does afford me a lot of opportunity to do things like sing in groups oriented to straight-up musical performance as well as doing community theatre, which keeps me going when work is particularly dreary - and in my very bureaucratic environs that's more often than I'd like.</p>
<p>I have a fairly regular uber-group of minis and boardgame players at the Meeplemart store on the east end of town.  RPGs are really only accessible with any sort of frequency at the Hairy Tarantula, though, or when I make it out to Montreal to visit Valet d'Coeur.</p>
<p>I do a podcast with my friend Justin Mohareb, called "Squideye and The Bitter Guy", and I take way too long to produce and upload the episodes after we record them.</p>
<p>I have a cat, named Pixel, who is making me age prematurely.</p>

                            Greetings!<br/><br/>I'm Jim Ryan.  I'm a broadcasting student, writer and podcaster currently residing in Charlotte, North Carolina.<br/><br/>I'm approximately 36 - give or take a couple of weeks.<br/><br/>I have a geeky, introspective blog/podcast called <a href="http://jimyesthatjim.com/" rel="nofollow">Jim - Yes, THAT Jim</a> and an RPG podcast called <a href="http://www.rpgdebate.com/" rel="nofollow">The Great Debate!</a>, in which I pretend to be a bunch of different RPG characters arguing with each other about subjects relevant to gaming.  Mostly it's an excuse to do silly voices. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>I'm also a former theatre guy and have a <a href="http://www.mainstreetrag.com/JRyan.html" rel="nofollow">book</a> of monologues coming out.  I have a habit of making up odd characters, writing monologues for them and performing said monologues at various open mic nights.  Once again, it's mostly an excuse to do silly voices.<br/><br/>I participate in a local writers' circle and try to write fiction every now and then.  Most of the stuff I write I describe as "darkly comedic science fiction and/or fantasy detective and/or adventure stories."  I've recently realized it would probably be easier to just call it "pulp."<br/><br/>As for RPGs, I'm a fan of Amber Diceless, Deadlands (and Savage Worlds in general), D&amp;D (all editions), World of Darkness (both tabletop and live action) and Call of Cthulhu.  I'm also playing (and heartily enjoying) a lot of games like In a Wicked Age, InSpectres and Lady Blackbird - the only problem being that it can be difficult to find groups willing to play them, so I try to spread the word about them as much as possible.  I have a near-desperate desire to get into games of Don't Rest Your Head or Dread one of these days.  I'm learning more about Spirit of the Century and other FATE-based games and would like to try those out as well.<br/><br/>I've also recently decided that one of my missions in life is to play as much Fiasco as possible.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

<br/>
I'm Nicholas Moore (or Nick if you prefer), where my real name is not an available handle I go by a gra, or n_o_moore.  I'm 22, a recent graduate of Sarah Lawrence College, and live in Westchester.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm a poet by degree (and trade?), and have a great passion for rpgs and rpg theory.  Which naturally lead me here.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a penchant for being academic and pedantic.  Please forgive me that failing. I am very excited to discuss the finer points of gaming with you all.                        </div>

I am a pharmacy technician (well, technically I *was* a pharmacy technician, and soon will be a Registered Pharmacy Technician). My day job mostly involves billing med checks and running reports of many types, and spending a lot of time with Excel.<br>
<br>
My gaming group has yet to finish an adventure, as we keep jumping systems. Most recently we've been playing Deathwatch (FFG) and Shadowrun, and I've started running Lady Blackbird. Past games include Don't Rest Your Head, Dresden Files, Rogue Trader, Pathfinder (several starts, but no actual play as of yet), DnD 3.5/4, and various board/card games made by FFG. <br/>
<br/>
Hobbies include many Xbox games and writing, as well as reading as much as time allows.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Hi! <br/>
<br/>
My name is Chill and I think gaming is cool. My interests besides gaming are helping people, making movie scenes out of lego and reading. I suffer from chronic pain which makes me unemployable to most people so I don't really have a job but I volunteer with various charities. I'm currently in university not studying anything in particular with aspirations of working with disadvantaged peoples.<br/>
<br/>
Gaming wise, I'm still new to forums in general and don't really understand a lot of "gaming theory" but I'm keen on figuring out my own games and figured this is a good place for such ambitions. <br/>
<br/>
Top 5 dead or alive is Gumshoe, Happy Birthday Robot, Dogs in the Vineyard, Ghostbusters and Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay.                        </div>

                            Hi. I'm Joshua Kubli. By day I'm a computer technician (mostly desktops, but some networking, web design, servers, you name it) at a hospital in a small town in Oregon. I'm 36, married to a beautiful, creative woman (who swears she will get me housetrained one day), and have an amazing, funny, sweet little twerp who just happens to be severely autistic. <br/>
<br/>
I've been roleplaying since I was in junior high, and developing games since high school. I've got a website (http://www.imperfekt-industrees.com/?gammes/imperfekt-gammes.html) and game design blog (http://invulnerablog.imperfekt-industrees.com/). <br/>
<br/>
I love extremely spicy food, iced mochas, fantasy, science, science fiction, comics, horror, history, some good movies, most bad movies, and philosophy of all kinds. I've a smattering of martial arts training. I have no pets but wish the house I rent would let us have a cat. My favorite authors are probably Roger Zelazny, David Gerrold, and Ken Wilber. I can't think of anything else right now, need more caffeine.                        </div>

                            Oops, I don't think I ever posted here.  Well, it was time for an update anyway.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Matt Sanchez, a 30 year old American married to an awesome Japanese girl (with no gaming inclinations).  I am working for an international logistics firm and living in Japan; I am studying to get my customs broker license when I move back to the States next year.<br/>
<br/>
I've been playing video games since I was a really tiny human, and now that I'm a bigger human I still enjoy the glow of the screen.  I found out 7 years ago, however, the joy of dice and face to face interaction.  Since then I've been obsessed with pen and paper role playing games, and I've been devouring everything I can get my hands on.<br/>
<br/>
Given that I am currently living in Japan, I've found the local scene and games very interesting.  I have been translating them when I have free time; my Ryuutama translation has been released and I have another big project coming up later this year (I hope).  I run a blog about Japanese RPGs at d66roc.wordpress.com as well.<br/>
<br/>
Other than games, I enjoy cooking, dancing salsa, reading and writing short stories of weird fiction, and sampling the local beer.  Cats are pretty awesome, too.                        </div>

                            G'day<br/>
<br/>
I'm Brett Evill, but I don't use my name much on-line because I'm sick of being given crap about it. I use the handle "Agemegos" pretty widely, and used to use "Agback" and "Silverback", back in the day.<br/>
<br/>
I was born in 1964, which makes me forty-six as a write this, but not destined to remain 46 for very long. I grew up to age 15 in Kempsey, a small country town in northern coastal New South Wales, Australia. Then I went to Sydney to get an expensive education, then to the University of New South Wales to study electrical engineering and computer science. In 1986 I went to Canberra to study economics at the Australian National University, and there I got stuck for 17 years, working as a transport economist and modelling programmer for the Australian Commonwealth Department of Transport (Bureau of Transport Economics). I retired in 2002, and in 2003 moved back to Kempsey partly because it is a nice area to retire to, and partly to look after my elderly (and now departed) mother.<br/>
<br/>
I got into RPGs in 1980 playing <i>AD&amp;D</i> in the library at Sydney Grammar School and with fellows I met there. Later I took part in the RPG scenes at UNSW (1982–1984) and ANU (1986–1990), though with little enthusiasm for D&amp;D in any form because of its arbitrary complexities and failure to support emulating any sort of fiction. I designed the 'module' for the first (1984) convention of the UNSW RPG Association, and later was involved with the <i>ForeSight</i> flexi-form adventures at CanCon. I have run free-forms at Sydcon '98 and CanCon, a tabletop game (<i>Après Moi L'Enfer</i>) at Necronomicon '04, and was one of two designers of a hybrid freeform/tabletop <i>Vampire</i> game "Canberra By Night". Apart from that, you might recognise one of my handles or my acerbic style from GMAST-L, TAOGM-L, &lt;rec.arts.frp.advocacy&gt;, the HERO Games forum, the Steve Jackson Games forum, or ENWorld.<br/>
<br/>
There is no gaming to be had where I live now, so until I can sell this dump and move to a city I am stuck with gaming by VoIP and InterNet video conferencing. And with making a very long drive for two monthly games.<br/>
<br/>
I'm single, my house is way too big, and I have an elderly Labrador retriever named "Lily".                        </div>

                            I'm Ian Raymond, an IT support consultant from the US/UK via Norway who lives in Christchurch, New Zealand.<br><br>I wrote quite a long and detailed post about my background and gaming history, but the session gods called timeout and it's been lost to the ether.<br><br>Much more briefly, since the mid 80's I've played (amongst others) D&amp;D red box, AD&amp;D 1 and 2E, Warhammer FRP, CoC, Shadowrun 1e, DND 3.0 and 3.5, Cybergen, V:TM, Mage, Werewolf, Champions, Pendragon, BESM, Buffy and collected many many more, in fits and starts with several multi-year fallow periods owing to moves.  My favourite gaming-item-as-artifact is of course my GWB.  I saw it on the shelf at Orcs Nest in London- you could hardly miss it, sticking out three inches- and was enthralled.  Even if I never dared run the thing...<br><br>For years I was very reluctant to GM games following some stressful experiences, but the reduced emphasis on the GM-as-source-of-all-fun (a major stress factor) and the more structured role in wonderful games like Mouse Guard, AW, Leverage, PEP, Diaspora etc etc have got me dipping my toes into running one shots and short games again.  <br><br>So, a big shout out and thank you to the wider storygames community for putting these great games together and giving me this opportunity to put something back into the hobby in a small way.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            My name is Garret, I'm 31 and I live in Minneapolis, MN.<br/><br/>I started gaming when I was 13, my half brother found out a week later and gave me a near complete collection of AD&amp;D books.  I've been hooked ever since.  I was introduced to story gaming about 2 years ago and have been enjoying it more and more.<br/><br/>I tried going to college but dropped out and joined the military.  I got out after 7 years and since then I've been drifting in a fog of depression ever since.  It's something I've battled all my life and it's nearly won more than once.<br/><br/>I've been a fire-fighter, a stable boy, a volunteer science interpreter and manager for Goodwill.  I'm an avid outdoorsman, my earliest childhood memory being riding in a canoe in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.  I have chased and been chased by bears.  I can sail a boat, saddle my own horse and usually start a fire.<br/><br/>I don't normally use the nickname Bad Santa, but at a house con several years ago it was given to me, so I used it for the forum.                        </div>

                            Wow, I missed being #666 by a single entry . . . <br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, my name is Pat, and I've been a serious gamer since 1979 or so -- 1st ed. ADnD.  Off and on for the last 30+ years I've played a ton of different games, but lately I've been doing a lot of Savage Worlds and Castles &amp; Crusades.  Just discovered Old School Hack as well as Lady Blackbird, and can't wait to get involved with either game.  <br/>
<br/>
Like many folks my age (47), I went through a time when I couldn't or didn't play.  Over the last 10 or so years I figured that was BS and got back into it.  Just two weeks ago I got back together with some old friends to play a game -- some of these guys hadn't been in the same room with each other since the '80s!  We had a great time and hoping to get together again soon.  One of my old cronies became a Master Brewer over time and brought in some of his mead.  Now that was cool!<br/>
<br/>
Professionally I'm a music teacher in a small school district in Western Oregon, and have been doing so for the last decade+.  Prior to that I was a performing musician, but do to a neurological disorder had to adjust my career.  I am employed in my field, which is a good thing in this day and age . . . <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I look forward to being involved in this forum.  I'm also trying to find gamers in the Willamette Valley, specifically Eugene.<br/>

                            My name is Todd Furler. I was born in 1961 (more meaningful than my age, since that keeps changing) and started role-playing in 1978 or so. I run traditional RPGs. I also occasionally play, but mostly I GM. I also enjoy light- to middle-weight Euro-style board games.<br/><br/>I'm a chemical engineer by education, but have never held a job as a chemical engineer. I've worked for the same electric utility in eastern Pennsylvania since I was 22 years old. For my company, I've worked as a chemistry technician, technical writer, computer support guy, instructor, and a few other things that can't be easily described. <br/><br/>What's been my favorite job so far? Twice a year, my employer conducts a company-wide drill, where we pretend massive storms have caused extensive power outages throughout our territory. I train and coordinate 30 volunteers who pretend to be 200 repair crews that our storm-response personnel "dispatch" to these simulated outages. The whole exercise is, in essence, a corporate-wide role-playing game, and I get to help GM it.<br/><br/>- Todd                        </div>

                            My name is Steve, my user name is an anagram of my real name. I came across this site while looking into John Harper's excellent Danger Patrol beta.<br/>
<br/>
I was born in '77 (about the same time some people started playing it seems). I've got a fairly large collection of RPGs, but trimmed back a little when I moved to Dorset in the UK (from Hampshire).<br/>
<br/>
Highlight games along the way Heroquest (the MB boradgame introduced me to gaming in general), D&amp;D very briefly and GURPS (long time fan until the skill list reached more than 2 pages of small type). Through the name Steffen O'Sullivan found Fudge, then FATE 2.0 then a whole new world! Current fave is FU: the Free Universal RPG by Nathan Russell, check it out if you like rules-lite narrative games.<br/>
<br/>
I love it so much I run the Fan Made FU RPG Yahoo Group.<br/>
<br/>
I'm an accountant (manager, possibly partner one day or my own firm), have two girls (2002 and 2005) who I'm starting to game with and a long term partner who won't. I never went to uni but my career's been fine so it hasn't mattered.<br/>
<br/>
I have no trouble coming up with ideas, but seeing them through is a really big problem! A bit more application and I might be known here, but as it is I'm mostly happy flitting here and there (mostly).<br/>
<br/>
Lost my gaming group a little while back so solo play is where it's at until my kids grow I suspect.                        </div>

                            I'm Tera Benoit, I'm 21 years old. I was raised in a tiny little town In Southeast Texas. I moved to Bellingham, Washington about two years ago. I'm half way through my graphic design degree and I draw comics as a hobby and a past time. As well as read them in large quantities. My favorite genre is cyber-punk and I spend a lot of time with m nose burried in books by Masamune Shirow and similar genre writers. <br/>
<br/>
I write and work on tabletop games with my boyfriend and my room mate as a small group with the working name of Running From Skeletons. <br/>
<br/>
I was introduced to this site by several people at PAX prime and I was so excited to find a group of people into the construction of tabletop story games and talking about them. <br/>
<br/>
My first game was dungeon and dragons back when I was 12 and 3rd edition was still pretty new. Since then i've <br/>
played dozens of games and have to say it's probably my second passion behind art. <br/>

You can call me Tera or Nachte, (nah-kh-ta) I'll happily answer to both.                        </div>

I am Matt Razincka. I am 32 and live in Seattle (yes, right in the city!) with my wife, Caroline. I grew up here for most of my life but spent a couple years in northern Wisconsin and my high school days in Bozeman, Montana. I started in tabletop gaming with Star Frontiers when I was about ten years old. That lead to the TMNT RPG, then D&amp;D, Warhammer, etc, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Somewhere along the line, I started writing an RPG of my own, taking bits and pieces from every RPG and video game I could get my hands on. It has gone through many iterations. It was originally a fantasy game. Over the years, it has become a post-apocalyptic fantasy game. In the last few years, the world has begun to take shape in leaps and bounds. The rules are coming along slowly, but are certainly getting there. I call the setting "Crushed Earth" and the system "Multiversal". Will post more about this in a separate post.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to call me Matt or Kane. I'll answer to either!                        </div>

<br/>
My name is Tony. I'm local to buffalo and take host in a bunch of different activities, right now mainly atheism and gaming. I'm a psychology major at SUNY Buffalo, I work with kids who have high functioning autism, specifically, we use video games - basic retail stuff, your halo and mario brothers - in order to identify emotion, processes of others and such.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually I'd like to work in the game industry, either designing system mechanics in education once someone decides that k-12 should be streamlined, or working in the indie games market, sinking my hooks into a garage programmer rock star and feed them scraps of cognitive psych under the table so the little company can get big and strong<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately, I've been designing a little here and there. I was a John Wick fan for a while, particularly of his youtube series in '09. I made a game for Tron Legacy once it came out, which played through well, but I saw my stream of ideas die out before my eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I've taken up too much screen time<br/>
<br/>
Holler at me if anything I'm talking about sounds interesting -- we'll chat.                        </div>

Hello! I'm Max and I also live in the Seattle, WA area, though I'm much closer to Tacoma. I've gamed for 4 years now, my entire high school career, with one group and played D&amp;D 3.5 almost the whole time, with a year set out for our Star Wars RPG game(pre-Saga edition). It started getting stale, so I looked around and found Indie games. We've now played Lady Blackbird and are extremely excited to try more.<br/>
<br/>
I now go to university at Pacific Lutheran University, though I don't live there, I commute. If you go to PLU too, contact me, we're desperately looking for another player!<br/>
<br/>
I'll probably ask a lot of questions, but I hope I can contribute too.                        </div>

<br/>
Old time gamer up in here looking to learn what all you whipper-snappers are talkin' 'bout. What's all this 'tory game you talking about? D'em tories were kicked out back to England back the start of the reveloution weren't dey?<br/>
<br/>
Seriously I'm a long time gamer looking to learn about the newer forms of gaming. I was pretty up on the indie gaming seen until about 2007 but I've been busy with school and other obligations but now time is allowing me to check out my favorite hobby again. <br/>
<br/>
So hello everyone hope to see you out there chatting sometime. <br/>

                            I don't think I ever replied to this thread. I'm Josh. I live in the UK, near London, where I work for the Government, currently on climate change policy. I have a girlfriend who roleplays, and two cats who don't. OK, so they probably roleplay as well, but they do it systemless. When I'm not working, sleeping or roleplaying I like looking after my garden, strategy games, cooking and eating. Yet I weigh practically nothing.<br/><br/>I play a lot of different games, primarily of a slightly more trade cast, especially investigative and horror games, or better yet investigative horror games! But am just dipping my toe into the wonderful world of Fiasco, Dogs in the Vineyard and all that other good stuff. <br/><br/>That's enough from me.                        </div>

                            Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I'm Chris (or Wayne, take your pick) and I'm a 31 year-old Philadelphian native who has been living in Osaka Japan since 2006. I found these forums a few days ago after stumbling across a link to "Lady Blackbird" and "Danger Patrol Beta" on another forum.<br/>
<br/>
I started RPing back in the early '90s after I got the old Milton Bradley "HeroQuest" game and then found the original, first edition "Gamma World" boxed set at a flea market for a quarter (awesome!). I then moved on to AD&amp;D 2nd edition, Westend's StarWars d6, D&amp;D 3.5, and more recently D&amp;D 4e, the new World of Darkness, Savage Worlds, and Ubiquity.<br/>
<br/>
When I started playing RPGs, I was primarily a gamist, probably due to my Magic: the Gathering upbringing. Everything had to be balanced, rules had to be clearly spelled out, and I wanted a rule for every possible situation that could arise. D&amp;D 4e took that to the extreme however, and kind of broke me. In the past two years or so I've started becoming more of a narrativist, and have started looking at story games rather than "traditional" RPGs. I've really come to appreciate their simplicity and the freedom that they give players. Plus running them will hopefully make me a better GM.                        </div>

                            Ethan K, 22yo digital media analyst based in San Francisco. I just moved here from Portland (where I graduated from college), and love the story gaming community in the Bay. <br>
<br>
I'm a cyclist, beer fan, and will probably chase after a PhD in a couple of years (in case nothing else changes).<br>
<br>
I first ran DnD for a cousin when I was, like, 11, and I've been the GM for my friends' games ever since. I loved the performance and transformation power of these games, and feel like I've finally found the appropriate tools (particular indie RPGs) for creating the experiences I've wanted but couldn't create with Cthulhu/DnD.<br/>

Also, crushing all over Fabricated Realities and looking forward to it next June.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Holy shit, I’ve been lurking for four years and never managed to write one of these.<br/><br/>I’m Gary, age 38 and change; married, and father to and pal of a little boy who, to my everlasting nerd-parent joy, now asks for <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i> by name.  My first gaming experience was circa 1981, when some forward-thinking elementary school teacher took me out of class to play something Dragons-something.  I recall being assigned the thief, Bilbo, and rolling dice while moving checkers around a map, and not knowing what the fuck was going on but thinking it was kinda cool.<br/><br/>In the last oh say ten years I’ve made the shift away from White Wolfy games into a more indie mode, and while I do enjoy a rollicking session of Emo Supervillains With Fangs or Mage: the Ascension Unto The Soapbox*, these days I am more of a Burning Wheel/Apocalypse World/Stolzean Weirdness gamer.<br/><br/>Quite apart from that, I’m on the downslope of a Master’s in GIS, I write lurid swords-and-sorcery stories for my own amusement, and I like spicy food, the ethnicker the better.<br/><br/>~Gary<br/><br/>*Not to pick on Mage.  Hell, half of my graduation gift to myself is a Metaphysic of Magick tattoo – so if it’s goofy, I’m goofy right there with it.                        </div>

<br/>
I worked as a freelancer for White Wolf, then as a full-time developer (Dark Ages), then laid off, then freelancer, then said, "Screw this noise" and went to grad school. And now I'm a speech-language pathologist working for the Cleveland Metropolitan School District, freelancing on the side (mostly for White Wolf, though Green Ronin and Eden have occasionally thrown work my way). <br/>
<br/>
I'm currently putting together my own game, called curse the darkness (more at cursethedarkness.net). Would love feedback and opinions and stuff, but I'll post to the appropriate threads. :)                        </div>

 I've been playing rpgs since 1980 and have played a lot of different systems. Recently (partly due to playing too much D&amp;D) I've been looking at other game systems which have lighter mechanics and more emphasis on narration.<br/>
I've started to play ICONS and Apocalypse World and Barbarians of Lemuria. I have Fiasco, Dead of Night and Hollowpoint but have not played them yet - my games group is a bit trad and one player pretty much refuses to play anything other than D&amp;D.<br/>
 I played 'A Penny for My Thoughts' and it was the most immersive roleplay sessions I've ever had. I'm going to use it to help in character generation for other games.                        </div>

In my free time, I play yo-yo, I play rpgs, I build stuff and I design games which i'll talk about later.<br/><br/>I've been playing savage worlds for around a year, played a 2 year long serenity game before that, and various rpgs before that. I'm nervous about GMing, so i usually stick to picking apart mechanics and subsystems and trying to apply them to new content as I get the chance. <br/><br/>I built a little Tron thing when tron legacy came out which turned out pretty well, and I designed some subsystems for savage worlds which turned out -- well i'm not publishing them anytime soon.<br/><br/>Anyways thats me, well met.                        </div>

                            Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I'm Stephanie.  I'm 34 and based in Wellington, NZ.  I started roleplaying when I was 13 and my twin sister and I were the only regular female roleplayers in our entire city (plus a couple of older women who occasionally dropped in or came to the same parties) - Wellington is much better in that respect.  I've been larping since my mid twenties.<br/>
<br/>
Er, what else may be of interest?  I'm officially both a tech geek and a book geek (degrees in Engineering and English Lit/Latin), and know rather more than anyone probably wants to know about St Margaret of Antioch.  I work for the local railway company.  My partner and I recently embarked on Responsible Grownup Things like buying a house, and I'm finding that the best bit is being able to do what we like in the garden.  I've published a couple of larp scenarios (Flying Monkeys on DriveThruRPG) that were very silly, with a third more serious one planned for February. I sometimes write fiction for fun, and have recently dipped my toes in the heady waters of fanfic.<br/>
<br/>
I generally prefer system-light gaming.  The Indie RPG movement is still something I'm trying to get a handle on - I play some games on offer from time to time at local conventions and hear people talking about them, but it's not my Big Thing.<br/>

                            Hello, everybody!<br/><br/>I've been lurking here for some time, posted thrice. I feel it's about time I introduced myself: I'm Rafael Ferreira, nice to meet you. A brazilian lawyer and aspiring copywriter, these days surviving as a webmaster, who lives in Rio de Janeiro (were I was born and raised).<br/><br/>Born in 1980 (31), started playing in the 90s. Though most of this time I've played "traditional" roleplaying, lately I've been moving towards "storygame sensibilities" and games that support them, like <i>Cinematic Unisystem</i>, <i>Fiasco</i>, <i>Cortex Plus</i> and <i>Microscope</i> (I'm yet to play the last two). This shift, so to speak, brought me here. As I've stated in my application for the forum, I'm looking for better (more fulfilling) gaming experiences.<br/><br/> Other than gaming you can count movies, fiction books, comic books, parties, <a href="http://www.sixtysymbols.com/" rel="nofollow">science trivia</a> among my <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=5&amp;ved=0CFEQtwIwBA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D0I6xkVRWzCY&amp;ei=zgzlTo_xNYnFtgfopNHzAw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGRKn4NFr5UuxDtgC0O9CkIm424Jw" rel="nofollow">favorite things</a>.<br/><br/>- Rafael                        </div>

I'm a Generic System junkie who lives for tactical combat, but is trying to get his local groups to eembrace more indy development. Enjoys freeform online roleplay for characterization, but LIVES in the structures of rules. I don't see 'fluff' I see 'crunch' and then build on it little empires of madness inducing mechanical mayhem. Been playing since the early 80's and unlikely to stopy any time soon.<br/>
<br/>
I'm the guy who thinks you have have GREAT characterization in GURPS or HERO as long as you know how to use the cruch to empower the fluff. Etc.<br/>

I've spent the last few years trying to, well, try every game I could get my hands on. Mainstream, indy, in-between, you name it, I love to see what people have come up with. Unfortunately it's been hard to find enough time and people to play them all!<br/><br/>I started with AD&amp;D 2nd, then did some oWod (V:tM &amp; W:tA), then onto D&amp;D 3.5. I was loving it, but started wondering what else was out there. From there I started getting into all kinds of other systems and games thanks to the internet. I was ignorant of things like the Forge, and the works of Jared Sorenson and Vincent Baker for a long time, I'm glad to have finally discovered them.<br/><br/>I'm currently working on my own personal game project called <a href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0ByyGYE4WMQsFM2VmYjZhZWQtYjVjMy00NmJkLWI1ODYtYWZmZDA5ZDk5M2Q5" rel="nofollow">Dungeon City Blues</a>, it is a low fantasy detectives game. Nothing groundbreaking, I'm not re-inventing the wheel, it's very traditional, I'm just trying to build a free, simple, flexible system with which to run some mystery games.<br/><br/>Outside of gaming I am also a big music fan, I play bass guitar in an urban folk rock band and am starting to amass quite the collection of instruments and gear, far outweighing my actual skill.<br/><br/>Well that's me in a nutshell, nice to meet you all <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Hey all,<br/>
<br/>
I'm Daniel and I started gaming when I was about 13. My first exposure to RPGs, however, was through online forums, mostly RPoL.net which is where I developed my interest for gaming. I never had a lot of money to spend so, naturally, I played a lot of free RPGs which led me to become interested in the indie subset of gaming. Now-a-days, I'm very interested in games like World of Darkness and Dungeons &amp; Dragons, but my roots are definitely in indie RPGs especially because I love the collaborative storytelling aspect of gaming. Whenever I game, it's usually because I have ideas for stories in my head that I want to play out. I could just write the stories down, but I always find it more fun to flesh stories out with a group under the framework of a game.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, I am 19 and am majoring in graphic design. I do freelance graphic design on the side to try to help pay for my studies and I've actually recently started designing my own RPG. I'm mostly doing this to add some extra graphic design pieces to my portfolio, but I'm also hoping it may help me pay for college. We'll see how it goes, of course. My other main hobby is competing in speedcubing competitions where contestants try to solve Rubik's Cubes and similar puzzles as quickly as possible. I'm also an avid comic book fan, love playing tennis, and am always excited to check out art.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm happy to be aboard, and will definitely have fun lurking about the threads,<br/>

                            Hi everyone! I'm not sure why I haven't shown up on here sooner. I'm just that good at procrastination, I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
I'm Connie Allison and I was born and raised in a small town on the South East coast of Florida called Fort Pierce. In 2008 I moved to Philadelphia and I have been here since. I'm 24 years old and a Community College student studying Early Childhood Education and still quite unsure about what I want to do when I "grow up". I have 3 siblings, a brother, 40, and two sisters, 37 and 22. They are all married and the girls have children. I'm kind of the odd one out in my family. My sister's think I'm so very wild and crazy because I live in the city and I take public transportation! I think they need to get out of our hometown and experience the world.  <br/>
<br/>
I started gaming in 2008. I was enticed by Tales of the Fisherman's Wife. Then 3:16 Carnage Amongst the Stars. Then Annalise. My only background knowledge of RPG's was that the cool kids in Marching Band who were also in Swing Troupe played D&amp;D on occasion. After playing so many indie games, I finally had an opportunity to try D&amp;D and I wasn't all that impressed. I'd been spoiled by story gaming. I've no complaints. <br/>
<br/>
In the beginning I was quite introverted and I worried that I would "do it wrong". But over time I became more and more comfortable creating things with friends. As ridiculous as it sounds, gaming brought me out of a shell and helped me to develop more confidence and respect for myself and my ideas.                        </div>

<br/>
I'm Sam. 22, from New Zealand. About half the people I know use my government name, and the other half call me "biggles," a nickname I picked up at about 14. I started RPing fairly recently, when I was 18 or so at university. I've been inventing games since before I can remember and programming computers since about eight. I started roleplaying to expand my game design vocabulary by figuring out how it works. I have a Comp.Sci degree, but quit my honours year half way through 2011 to waste my time trying to finish my video games and sell them (life goals!!!) and work as a web application developer. I don't cope well with time-pressure and high workloads. I'm quite into math, hip hop (tried running a rhyming rpg on a forum once! hard to make PCs feel heroic when you can out-rap them easily!), electronic music, and open source / open media stuff. My RP bros and I play using a system we made up by playtesting and aggressive deletion of rules that we would maybe like to share with y'all when we're done typing it up (incl fantasy supplement thingy.) Assuming that doesn't break hidden rules of etiquette. Also here to participate in the class A roleplaying discussion. I learned a bunch of cool things lurking today.<br/>
<br/>
What else?? No idea. This marks the end of the line. My personality ends here.                        </div>

Hi, I'm Rowan.  Geek girl originally from San Francisco, now transplanted to Central Pennsylvania.  I grew up playing D&amp;D and World of Darkness, and a few weeks ago (no, seriously) I discovered that there's this whole world of awesome games out there and that all this critical theory and "how do I find a game that does [x]" is actually talked about by other people and that I don't have to be a freak at my gaming table because I want to talk about this stuff.<br/>
<br/>
When I grow up I want to take over the world.  :)                        </div>

                            I'm Marco "Iz" Valtriani, born in 1980 in a cold day of october<br/>
I live in italy, I'm married with a son. <br/>
I am a (board)game designer. I'm also an advertiser and graphic designer. I'm trying to design RPG to, and my boardgaming experience is influencing me a lot... but we'll talk later about this :)<br/>
After a short experience as an amateur board games self-publisher, I designed a couple boardgames "on demand", Fiume di Parole, for italian schools, and La Grande Opera, for the "Museo Ideale" of Leonardo da Vinci. In 2011, Scribabs published my first "gamer's game": 011.<br/>
From 2008 to 2011, I was the president and the "mind" behind Creatori di Divertimento (ital. "Fun Makers"), an association of game designers, illustrators, and workers of the "gaming world", focusing on "luding culture"; the association, that is well-known in italian gaming community, works to help luding operators, to organize events and fairs.<br/>
In 2011, I left the head of the association to avoid any conflict of interests, focusing my activities on the creation of games.<br/>
Talking about RPGs, I began with Merp and D&amp;D 1ed, then I played and enjoyed a lot Call of Cthulhu and Rolemaster, and a lot of other stuff with more or less fun.<br/>
Now I like a lot some "new" games (my favs are Polaris and Don't Rest Your Head), but I never disowned my passion for "old" RPGs.<br/>
After a few "bad" attempts, non I'm working on a game with my wife, which is called Sakura. The game is gm-less, is set in medieval japan and is based on the concepts of duty and desire. One of the reasons I signed in is to talk about it with all of you.                        </div>

                            Hi all<br/><br/>I live in London, UK. I'm an ex-EFL teacher, now games designer, started out designing a playing-card word game but now want to design RPGs (got one in the works already, have posted about it separately). Got into role-playing when exposed to RPGs for the first time at IndieCon 2010, UK. Been hooked ever since. <br/><br/>I'm 46 (but feel and- I like to think- act younger, daddy-oh!); unmarried, no children, no pets, too busy for a social life- Hell, the internet is my social life! (Yeah, sad, aren't I?).<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Leo                        </div>

                            Hi, my name is Justus.  I'm 33, an architect, and currently living in Houston but was raised in California.  My primary hobby is boardgaming and I'm not sure how long my interest in indie RPG's will last (re: my  dead flickr account).  I have essentially no RPG experience but I just stumbled across the world of indie RPGs I love reading game rules and I find the idea of structured storytelling fascinating.  This seems like a great chill place to be and I hope enjoy conversating with y'all!  <br/>
<br/>
For what its worth my handle on boardgamegeek is also aaarg_ink and that place is essentially my home on the internets (aside from gmail).<br/>

I live with my girlfriend and two very cute, mischievous, loving (to each other, not us), destructive bunny rabbits.                        </div>

I live in the East Bay and played my first story game (Apocalypse World) just a few months ago.<br/><br/>I love the immersive, transformative element of this game style (versus the handful of traditional games I played in high school) and feel pretty lucky living in an area with lots of little cons and gaming communities to explore. I'm looking forward to the Monsternomicon at EndGame in May and Big Bad Con in October. Hopefully I'll be able to make it out to Fabricated Realities in June.                        </div>

                            Hello all,<br/><br/>I'm Malcolm Heath, and generally can be found on the internet as malcolmpdx.<br/><br/>I'm 40 years old, as of 2011, and rapidly approaching 41.  I live in Portland, Oregon, and have for the last 22 years, having come out here for college, and deciding to stay.  Before that, I grew up in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  I've been gaming since I was 8 or so, having first been introduced to RPGs via the 1979 Basic D&amp;D edition.  <br/><br/>In the 80s I played many of the games that were popular (at least in Minneapolis) at that time, ranging from Traveller, to the Morrow Project, Gamma World, Villains and Vigilantes, Behind Enemy Lines, Space Opera, various Palladium games, Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes, James Bond: 007, Paranoia, and so forth, along with the usual D&amp;D stuff.  <br/><br/>When I was 15, I was introduced to Tekumel (AKA, Empire of the Petal Throne) and got completely obsessed with that for quite a while.  I think that this point marked a big change in how I approached gaming.  The depth of the setting allowed for an immersive experience which I realized that I'd been looking for and not finding for a long time.  <br/><br/>Then in 2002, I attended U*CON in Michigan, and met some folks who played Amber.  Somehow, I'd missed that.  It was a life-changer, too; Amber gaming showed me that it was possible to do things without the sort of rules I was used to, and showed me that I could run and play in games that were more about the characters involved than their powers or external capabilities.  I attended AmberconNW shortly after, and found a pile of gamers who were really, really good at the sort of gaming I'd come to realize was what I wanted.  Joy ensued, and continues each November.<br/><br/>Since then, I've been slowly finding my feet as a GM, learning how to run the sorts of games I like, and having rather more awesome gaming experiences on a regular basis than anyone should likely be allowed to have.<br/><br/>Outside of gaming, I have worked as a systems admin, IT manager, and security geek for many years.  This is despite my degree being in Religious Studies (i.e. comparative religion).  On that note, since others have posted in this thread about it, I'm an Episcopalian Christian, having been raised as that, but only recently returned to it after having had a long journey through several other paths.  It's quite important to me, and I'm what might be considered "devout", but tend to answer all questions regarding religion with "it depends".  As indeed it does.  <br/><br/>I'm married, no kids, and have a great relationship, for which I am very, very grateful.<br/><br/>I've traveled a bit, to the UK, South America, The Caribbean, Indonesia, and all around the US and Canada. I hope to do more of this.  <br/><br/>As for why I'm here - I know, or at least know online, several folks who are regulars here, and "story games" popped up on my radar a year or two ago.  I think, from reading the forums for a while, that I'm going to dig this.  Great, thoughtful conversations about the very topics that interest me most about role-playing.                        </div>

                            Welcome, everyone. Glad you made your saving throw, Dave! <br/><br/>Malcolm, if you want to start a thread about your experiences with Tekumel, I'd love to hear about it. I've been one of those people who follow it in a vague sort of way but I've always been way too intimidated by it to play it.                        </div>

                            Who am I?  That is a valid question.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Raymond Terry, I am an African American male, 46 years old, who loves both video games and tabletop role-playing games, finds it hard that there are not more African Americans in the gaming industry, and feels that it is time I dipped my hand back into the tabletop RPG cookie jar.<br/>
<br/>
My interest are reading, gaming, watching movies, and taking a stab at blogging.  I wanted to be a writer, and actually had something written, but never finished it.  That is one of my ongoing projects that I occasionally take out and dust off for old times sake.  Now I am moving more into the blogosphere to get some practical experience writing and keeping on task with projects.<br/>
<br/>
Current projects: <br/>
Designed and maintain gaming blog called “Old Gamerz”, and have begun work on a game inspired by the old DC heroes RPG published by Mayfair Games back in the early 90's.  <br/>
<br/>
I am also on Google + , Twitter, and Facebook.  Mostly on Google + though.                        </div>

i joined this site ages ago, but i recently played Lady Blackbird so i'm looking to help and get help (with my games).<br/>
<br/>
If i'm awake, i'm probably thinking about games.  i've been doodling games of various kinds since i was 9.  i'm an idea hamster.  i can generate ideas faster than i can write them.  By the time i've jotted the idea onto paper i'm already bored with it and moving on to the next thing.<br/>
<br/>
i grew up in Alabama and Germany.  Spent four years in the USAF as an intel analyst (i'd have to kill you if i said more than that).  Got my degree at Columbia College Chicago.  Since then i've been working mostly in IT.  These days i'm a house husband, starving artist and aspiring game designer.                        </div>

I'll put spaces between many of my sentences.<br/>
<br/>
 I've lived a lot of different places, but no place that's incredibly interesting - Florida, Connecticut, Ohio, California.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if I have an interesting anecdote.  I once made a mocha for Robin Williams, and he was as short as me and looked like he was just as tired, but he smiled and was polite and thankful for the caffeine.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm married to a historian/early childhood educator and have a cute baby girl who is 7 months old.  <br/>
<br/>
In a month and a half I'll be unemployed and technically homeless, though we're able to move in with friends so thankfully not entirely homeless.  <br/>
<br/>
I also have a new sci-fi RPG that just went up on Kickstarter [http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2072399402/the-parsec-rpg].  I'm proud of all the work that I put into it and afraid that everyone who reads it when it is finally printed will hate it.                        </div>
