I've been reading Ryan Dancey's series of posts on his blog, about the future of the hobby, and his ideas impressed me a lot. It seems like Mr. Dancey thinks Story Games are the future of the hobby!\n<blockquote>The goal of most of the people in the hobby is not \xe2\u20ac\u0153play a role\xe2\u20ac\x9d.  The goal of the hobby community is \xe2\u20ac\u0153tell a great story\xe2\u20ac\x9d.  Roleplaying is a tactic, not a strategy.  Some participants want to play roles, and that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s fine.  Others want to provide narrative structure.  Still others want to create systems for interaction and adjudication.  And another group wants to generate environments.  All of these people need to be made co-equal for the hobby to succeed long term.</blockquote>\nThe posts so far are here:\n<ol><li><a href="http://web.mac.com/rsdancey/iWeb/RSDanceyBlog/Blog/D97DB2B1-A376-4162-85FB-5E6C0DB4EE90.html" rel="nofollow">Climb The Highest Mountain</a></li><li><a href="http://web.mac.com/rsdancey/iWeb/RSDanceyBlog/Blog/466B8CAC-73A1-49CC-BD21-4A00321C05C8.html" rel="nofollow">Keep Hope Alive!</a></li><li><a href="http://web.mac.com/rsdancey/iWeb/RSDanceyBlog/Blog/92BD6D49-961B-486A-9FF4-3B306E1BF235.html" rel="nofollow">Step 1:  Redefine The Hobby</a></li><li><a href="http://web.mac.com/rsdancey/iWeb/RSDanceyBlog/Blog/3D5EF842-0B0F-4DEC-A21A-F379AEDF15B6.html" rel="nofollow">Step 2:  Redefine the Experience</a></li></ol> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88206/#Comment_88206" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-15T14:12:14+00:00" title="August 15, 2007  2:12PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I"m in a thread on ENWorld right now discussing his posts.

The group then uses a structured framework to determine the variables of the story they will tell (or they use a framework built by others and distributed to the community, or they continue using a framework established by the group at a previous session).

Some people that my read Dancey's post may have never even heard of a "storygame" before, and it may just scratch their itch.  I for one, know that groups like Storygames never reached out to folks like myself on other boards who might've been looking for something different but didn't know where to look, so its good that someone is putting it out there.  Folks on this boards seem to forget, that there are alot of folks that don't get to go to Gen Con and can't be apart of four different boards and may not know all the neat stuff that is out there for people to play.  So I applaud Dancey for being another outlet to let people know that there is another set of roleplaying games out there to be experienced, and I applaud that he says that they may even be what the general public is looking for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dogui" title="Dogui"><img alt="Dogui" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dogui">Dogui</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88235/#Comment_88235" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-15T17:19:54+00:00" title="August 15, 2007  5:19PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, I posted his articles in my blog and I arrived at the same conclusion.

He's speculating that there could be games that focus on story instead of roleplaying.  He's completely missing the fact that these games already exist.  He's not saying, "Oh look, and here they are, and here are resources for you to find other games like this, and how to buy them."

My problem finding people to play with evaporated as soon as I stopped defining people as "gamers" and "non-gamers".  Everyone loves playing games, everyone loves telling stories.  The secret is finding games that let people tell the stories they like, in the ways they want to.  Everyone's a gamer just waiting for the perfect game for them.  <br/><br/>I think Ryan's right that there's a perceptual problem with roleplaying games that makes people balk at getting into them.  But I think that problem is shared by most gamers.  We think of our hobby as this unique, cultish activity, where recruits must be initiated and indoctrinated before they can be trusted to play.  That's simply not the case.  We've got to stop thinking of our hobby as this unique snowflake that must be protected, and start thinking of it as just another way to have fun.  Everyone likes fun (except Ryan Dancy).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88256/#Comment_88256" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-15T19:43:18+00:00" title="August 15, 2007  7:43PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well said, Simon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88259/#Comment_88259" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-15T21:24:48+00:00" title="August 15, 2007  9:24PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>What I don't understand in the article is the obsession with "saving" the hobby.

In the 80's, if you wanted to play some sort of fantasy "game", RPGs were the only way to do it. Now, computers offer a number of different ways to experience the same thing. Thus, computers have "stolen" some of the RPG audience. Is this "bad"? Maybe, maybe not.<br/><br/>His fear is that with an aging and dwindling fan base, new RPGs may stop being made. Is this a reasonable fear? Maybe, maybe not. Other hobbies have faded for lack of an audience. The "Adventure" video game genre has pretty much disappeared, for lack of an audience (well, more precisely, the Adventure genre became unprofitable).<br/><br/>I think he has a good point, though, in that we should be trying to distinguish ourselves from video games. If for no other reason than for good business. As he points out, the collaborative, emergent, "story" elements are the strong points for the RPG/Story-game media.

Yes, it's pointless to try and do what computer games can do far better than an RPG ever could, and Ryan's acknowledging that, which is cool.  <br/><br/>I guess what I'm saying is that the only way tabletop RPGs are going to "die out" is if we find other, more fun things to do.  Now, granted there might be some sadness in leaving behind all the history and memories, but we'll be consoled by our new, more fun hobby.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy" title="T-Boy"><img alt="T-Boy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy">T-Boy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88267/#Comment_88267" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-15T21:58:47+00:00" title="August 15, 2007  9:58PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: timfire</cite>The "Adventure" video game genre has pretty much disappeared, for lack of an audience (well, more precisely, the Adventure genre became unprofitable).</blockquote>I think the fundamental distinction that we need to make here is the difference between, say, a particular <em>hobby</em> and the <em>industry</em> that surrounds it. <br/><br/>Your example of the adventure game genre is cogent, as a matter of fact: because, yeah, hey, the days of LucasArts, Interplay, Infocom and Sierra developed adventure games are over, yes, but is the genre extinct, with no new works produced in the past five years? <a href="http://www.wadjeteyegames.com/shivah.html" rel="nofollow" title="Wadjet Eye Games, developer of the Shivah and the Blackwell series">Not exactly</a>.<br/><br/>But, you know, you can say that a genre can survive as a hobby, but that's not exactly a <em>good</em> thing; it'd be ideal if people can make games and play them easily, and at the same time <em>get paid for their work</em>. Which is, I figure, what Dancey wants in the end. Okay, so maybe he would like it if his rice-bowl doesn't suffer too much disruption, but you know, that's normal. Who exactly wants to look for new avenues of income?<br/><br/>I'm trying to figure out the people who are complaining that Dancey doesn't give story-games enough credit for doing exactly what he's outlining; I mean, he mentions <cite>Burning Empires</cite> as an example of what's good in gaming today. Yeah, it's <em>one</em> mention, but my experiences with learning about story-games makes me wonder: is it more likely that his omission is deliberate, or is it more likely that the s-g movement suffer from really low visibility?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/xternal" title="xternal"><img alt="xternal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/xternal">xternal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88268/#Comment_88268" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-15T22:06:22+00:00" title="August 15, 2007 10:06PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>What I don't understand in the article is the obsession with "saving" the hobby.

Even the game Dancey's vaguely describing, if we disregard the massive multiplayer thing he talks about in <a href="http://web.mac.com/rsdancey/iWeb/RSDanceyBlog/Blog/1A28B7E7-6D72-4000-8CD8-462FE0BD5E36.html" rel="nofollow">this further post not linked above,</a> reminds me a lot of the (unfinished and discontinued) <a href="http://www.collaborativeroleplay.org.uk/Ergo" rel="nofollow">Ergo </a> game framework by the same author - Ian Millington - on the same site.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Dancey added still another post, but this time he stops (for a while) describing how this wonderful idea is going to make everybody happy to <a href="http://web.mac.com/rsdancey/iWeb/RSDanceyBlog/Blog/E6E3F598-9591-4CFC-AEA4-82036D302600.html" rel="nofollow">cite some market research on player agenda.</a> But maybe whoever wants to discuss this will also want to do it in a separate thread.<br/><br/>To Simon: it doesn't look to me as if the point is contending players with MMORPG. On the contrary: both for Dancey and for Millington the basic assumption is that people who like tt roleplaying for the same reasons they like or would like MMORPG are gradually letting tabletop down for the online games for a reason: MMORPG are inherently superior in providing fun for them. They then basically suggest to address people who find their fun in other aspects of gaming. That looks to me like giving more fun to more people, not stopping anyone to have fun which what they like best in order to sell them *your* product (although that's far from alien from Dancey's philosophy on gaming, if I recollect well the d20 days).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88300/#Comment_88300" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-16T05:36:00+00:00" title="August 16, 2007  5:36AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tyler</cite>Some people that my read Dancey's post may have never even heard of a "storygame" before, and it may just scratch their itch.</blockquote>\nOr, they think "StoryTeller?

I'm not talking about Dancy pesonally, either. I'd look at this more as a sign that S-G games are on the cusp of breaking off into (at minimum) another major strain of hobby game if not actually yet an entirely distinct hobby.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88332/#Comment_88332" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-16T08:01:28+00:00" title="August 16, 2007  8:01AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just read the <a href="http://web.mac.com/rsdancey/iWeb/RSDanceyBlog/Blog/1A28B7E7-6D72-4000-8CD8-462FE0BD5E36.html" rel="nofollow">Step 3</a> blog entry JD linked to...<br/><br/>And this is why I was waiting to comment on any of this.

However his curriculum has him doing brand management for the 2003 release of D&amp;D 3.5 as well.

While the game represented one of the best implementations of the state of the art for game rules of its type, evolution on the technological platform have made it fundamentally obsolete.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>The GM \xe2\u20ac\u0153solution\xe2\u20ac\x9d most commonly employed is not very satisfying and doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t lend itself to a strong and interesting storytelling experience. Readers interested in some mechanical methods for addressing this kind of problem should take a look at Luke Crane\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Burning Wheel for some inspiration. (Actually, you should just get it, period, and as many other Crane works as you can. To really understand where the state of the art is in RPGs right now, Crane is required reading...)<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>In the most popular mode of play, a GM describes a 10x10 room, saying \xe2\u20ac\u0153in one corner there\xe2\u20ac\u2122s an Orc, and in the other corner there\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a pie\xe2\u20ac\x9d. As far as the players are concerned, the room has an Orc and a pie in it, and nothing else. In fact, using the mechanics of the game, there is nothing else, unless the GM, by fiat adds it.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/><br/>Further reading:<br/><br/>www.story-games.com<br/>www.indie-rpgs.com</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nicklessguy" title="Nicklessguy"><img alt="Nicklessguy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nicklessguy">Nicklessguy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88599/#Comment_88599" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-17T12:10:08+00:00" title="August 17, 2007 12:10PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2007 12:11PM by Nicklessguy.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, he links this place at the end of the post.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Ryan.

Simply put, what some people wanted out of their weekly D&amp;D session they now get better from a MMORPG. I'd say that's mostly the people who liked the whole game aspect of D&amp;D, but were not into the story side. <br/><br/>The story side, and particularly the ability of the player to drive the story as much as the GM is the hardest part for the MMORPG authors to emulate, because that requires real-time interaction between two people. And that's a damn expensive service to provide. <br/><br/>I'd say that Ryan's post is far more about how D&amp;D survives than about story games as we know and love them. Looking at the D&amp;D Insider announcment at the same time, it would seem that Ryan is pitching that focusing on shared story creation as a differentiator is how he sees tabletop gaming (and D&amp;D in particular) surviving. What is D&amp;D insider if not an attempt to mix the convenience of on-line play for many with the shared story-telling of the group. I'm not commenting on how successful this will be, but I would suspect this is the strategy being outlined.<br/><br/>WoTC solves the problem of providing the cost-effective interaction that differentiates a TRPG from a MMORPG by getting the fee-paying public to sign up to run the game as well as to play it. It really is some sort of hybrid model.<br/><br/>Story games as we care about them are probably only of interest to Ryan in that they reject much of what can be virtualized in a MMORPG in favour of shared narrative. As such they highlight what differentiates TRPG from MMORPG.<br/><br/>I think what we should take from it is the warm feeling that others have realized what we have that story games capture the essence of what is vibrant and important about the TRPG experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88720/#Comment_88720" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-18T11:04:51+00:00" title="August 18, 2007 11:04AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite>It's a bit sturm und drang-y, but there's just so much social energy pent up on the internet, if some RPG or storygame or whatever could harness that, they'd be onto something big.</blockquote>\nHonestly, I think that the indie scene really has, in its own way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blake%20T.%20Deakin" title="Blake T.
