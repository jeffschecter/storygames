                    So, lately, I've been pondering what factors seem to cause the games I play or run in to significantly differ in feel.  And it seems that one of the most significant factors is the ways that the styles of the players interact.<br/><br/>For example...<br/>I run a Nobilis game.  During those times when the flow of play is dominated by player-to-player interaction, it tends to be a slow-paced game.  The biggest problem with it, that I can see, is that the group sometimes tends towards indecisiveness even over very minor issues.  However, the spotlight time is generally quite even.<br/><br/>I play in a Buffy game.  In this game, scenes that are based on PCs talking with each other have a lot more energy and dynamism, even when there's nothing on the line but interparty relationships.  Also, debates about actually doing things tend to be resolved quickly in favor of "Well, here's a half-assed plan, which we'll do with vigor and verve.  If it doesn't work, we'll just make up a new one on the fly."  However, the spotlight time on this game is a lot less even, with some characters having more focus time than others.<br/><br/><br/>As far as I can tell, both of these factors are based largely on the proactive/reactive stance of the players.  In the Buffy game, one or two of the players tend to take much more active, dramatic, and flashy approaches to the game.  This has a couple effects.  First, it resolves "what-do-we-do" disagreements faster, since it's less considered weighing of options and more jumping hotheadedly into the breech.  Second, it makes it so that those characters have more focal screen time, especially when they're arguing with each other.  Now,  when one of the more active characters is arguing with one of the more passive ones, the passive one tends to perk up some for the duration of the interaction, but interactions between the more passive characters tend to have less zest.<br/><br/>In the Nobilis game, everyone seems to have more the same stance.  They're more likely to have their characters do nothing than to have their characters do something rash, and tend to be less likely to take the initiative without a push from the GM.  Thus, the game has a more even feel in spotlight time since there aren't a couple of people who tend to be the first to jump ahead, but it gets bogged down a lot faster.  The archetypal example of this in the game, which we joke about some, is when a group of Nobles spent half an hour talking about the best way to move a box a block and a half.<br/><br/>Now, I feel that if I could better understand these dynamics, it would probably make it easier to keep the feel and pace of games at where it should be.  But any sort of all-way interaction between a group of people over a length of time will tend to be quite complicated and intricate, so it's tough to get an understanding of the subtleties of how these things work.  The more obvious aspects, and the generalities... they're easier to spot, and they are helpful, but not as much as a closer understanding would be.<br/><br/>So, to what degree do my observations and comments here seem to be consistant with what all of you have seen?  Provide me with additional information, and add your brains to mine in a grotesque analytical hivemind!<br/><br/><span style="font-size: smaller; font-size: smaller;">Or we could just discuss this.  That would work too.</span> </div>

                            What, if anything, is engaging your players in the Nobilis game?  Cause it sounds like they're either not tied in as intricately as they could be, or they're worried beyond belief that they have to do the 'correct' thing or else get hosed for doing the wrong thing.                        </div>

                            Well, a lot of it seems to be that they're used to gaming in groups where somebody else provides the initial momentum in a group discussion, and so, they're working under assumptions and habits that don't apply to this specific group.                        </div>

                            I'm wondering if there's any impact of the fact that you're actually playing Buffy?<br/><br/>For example, the 'digs' of Buffy (TV), which the RPG pretty well emphasizes, is that it's not about coming up with elaborate tactical plans: "Let's Get 'Em!" is just as reasonable a plan as sitting around planning with counters and strategy.  However, the players have no examples from TV or whatever of a concept similar to Nobilis, so things like arguing over minutiae (ala Amber, D&amp;D, etc) is an acceptable form of social expression.  I imagine if someone tried it in the Buffy game, eventually you'd have another player say, "Geez, c'mon, this is <b>Buffy</b> here!" and that would be enough to kick off action, witty one-liners, runaway cross-species romance plots that work, etc.<br/><br/>I'm wondering if there were some examples that you could give to show that Nobilis could be run fast and loose if everyone was on the same page.  Maybe emphasize that there's no penalties for NOT discussing every little strategy and minutia, etc?<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

<p>I will offer that I've seen a lot of players (though not all of them) concentrate on one of two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>They want to do things right</li>
<li>They want to do things in their own distinctive way</li>
</ul>
<p>Often you can become more distinctive by sacrificing "doing it right" or become more right by sacrificing "doing it your way."</p>
<p>Yes, that's very overgeneralized.  But it sounds like your Nobilis players want to do things right (even if it means losing their distinctive flair), and your Buffy players want to do things their way (even if it means doing it wrong).</p>
<p>Does that sound accurate?</p>

                            I don't think it's just the games, for the reason that I've ran and played other games with some of the same people, and they seemed to generally have the same stances.  Beth, for example, will generally drift into a support role unless something pushes her into a more decision-making one.  Aman will generally go out and do things and yell at people regardless of the setting.  And so on.<br/>

                            I hate when players spend lots of time discussing what they should do next, whether in character or out, so I usually provide incentive for them to think quickly.  For example, in my Sorcerer game, they paused in the middle of combat to discuss who should do what, but I kept the combat going, so the NPC's were reviving/breaking Holds, etc. while they were standing around talking.  It certainly provides incentive for the players and characters to keep moving!  I'm not against well-laid plans, mind, I'm just against beating them to death or stopping in the middle of an intense situation to *talk*.<br/>

                            Well, thinking back to recent experiences, I've noticed that splitting the party is, far from a bad idea, a great way of picking up the pace and sharing spotlight time. On the other hand, both cases that I can think of were sort of instigated by me as a player. In a Dogs in the Vineyard game, the process of arriving at the town and making social arrangements (everybody wanted the honor of putting the Dogs up) resulted in conflicting obligations that I resolved by volunteering my character to stay with his aunt while the other PC stayed with the town Steward. So the ensuing action was split between scenes with each player dominating a scene.<br/><br/>Then in the Harn campaign I just got involved in, the PCs were summoned by their friends/patrons to hunt down a missing artifact. The scenario started with the entire party visiting the scene of the crime and very carefully questioning the witnesses. I'm not sure what the GM would have done, but it would have been easy to imagine the entire party moving from clue to clue. What prevented this from happening was the impression of urgency: it was believed that whoever had the item was going to take it somewhere where it wouldn't be possible to recover it. So I suggested that the party split up and carry out tasks that would be most appropriate to our skills and social contacts. I think this worked well because different people got spotlight time. Now, it worked very well for me since I got a big scene pretty much to myself, but I think the other players also enjoyed watching it play out.<br/><br/>If I were a GM trying to actively encourage this sort of development, I think I'd bring it up with the group and suggest if they were interested in any of the following:<br/><br/>--Playing scenarios where time was truly of the essence. I think some players really don't want to spend all day planning, but they'd feel more comfortable knowing that there's an in-game reason to speed up their decisionmaking.<br/><br/>--Situations that work well with characters operating in parallel. Issues of firewalling should possibly be discussed. (In the Harn game, there was some effort at firewalling but it was also played pretty loosely at other times. And in fact some of the scene cutting was done in a way that tacitly encouraged collaboration and "fortuitous" timing. E.g., a magical message was sent from a character in one scene at exactly the moment to resolve a quandary for a character in another scene.)<br/><br/>--Naturally, assuaging any paranoia about taking action separately or doing so without considering every possible angle. (Then again, this is only a problem if it's ruining somebody's fun. Including yours.

<br/>
I have.  Games run by both Kevin and I have seen huge pacing issues come up depending on who was present.  The most obvious case of this happened when we played with Dusty.  Dusty was a nice enough guy, but he was always planning wacky side stuff and requesting side conferences with the GM.  Despite fully intending to quash the solo-talks quickly, he'd spin interesting scenarios... while totally leaving the rest of the players idiling.  (This was a huge source of frustration for many of the players-- and even the GMs who participated.)  All of this is a side issue... but seems related.<br/>
<br/>
Closer to your main topic: yes, there are definite proactivity divides.  In Will's games, his wife will often have her character do nothing-- her characters will often sit at home and play computer games (etc.) if the plot doesn't come directly for her.  Because of that, the game will tend to shift to more proactive players-- such as Jim or me.  Will's games tend to be plotless, or nearly so-- so if the PCs don't supply a plot, little gets done.<br/>
<br/>
Jennifer [Will's wife] has engaged more in other systems.  Playing a very active character [Mercenary/ Team boss in Shadowrun] encourages her to engage-- and we wind up with a much more even spotlight distribution.                        </div>

<code>So, nobody else has noticed interactions between player personalities having an effect on pace and spotlight time?</code><br/><br/>Seriously, I think this question is roughly equivalent to "So nobody has noticed that the GM fudges dice rolls sometimes?" or "So nobody noticed that when the pizza arrives, not everybody gets the same number of slices?"  Dude, of course the personalities of the players in the game impact the game and how it plays out.  How could it not?<br/><br/>What I find interesting is the sense that people seem to have that this is an unfortunate and unavoidable obstacle, and there is nothing that they can possibly do about it.  Why Jennifer plays in Will's games where she is not engaged, and why Will does not set up his games to grab her character if that's what she needs to get engaged with the story, is pretty beyond me.<br/><br/>Why is treating the other players like people such a radical idea?                        </div>

'Course there are things that can be done about it.  The idea, here, is to use shared experiences of how this works to develop a better understanding of how this sometimes-complicated issue works out in practice.                        </div>

Habit. Will's a longtime freeformish storyteller system guy.  To go in making an active effort to read his players is 90 degrees from normal... though he'll roll with what you do, so you can get there via your own active effort.  [This is from a while ago, but not as long as I'd hope.]                        </div>
