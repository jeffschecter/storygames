                    In short: sell me on either Heroquest or Runequest.  I've never played either, and until about an hour ago thought that the two were interchangable (very wrong, it would seem.)<br/>What are the systems like in each?<br/>How will they help to create satisfying story/character within--rather than in spite of-- the rules?<br/>Which will be a better investment of my money?                </div>

<p>HQ's totally amazing. I can't speak to RuneQuest, but I can assure you that there is great richness of character in HQ. I can be more specific, probably, but I'm not sure what you're aiming at...can you toss some more specific questions?</p>

                            OK, let's keep in mind that as a member of the HQ demo team, and a dedicated "story-game" sort of guy that my selection should be no surprise. But I'll try to be specific.<br/>
<br/>
RQ is the old chaosium house rules, essentially. What was also used for Call of Cthulhu, and published generically as Basic Role-Playing (BRP). Being invented in '77, I think, it shows its roots. Quite innovative for the time, it still has fun stuff like hit points and armor for individual limbs, and works off of skills instead of levels, etc. Creating a character in RQ means selecting from a universal list of skills, with the help of setting material that indicates what's appropriate for X sort of character.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, you may also be refering to the new RQ from Green Ronin. That's a d20 version. I'm assuming you're familiar with D&amp;D? It's very much just D&amp;D in Glorantha.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hero Quest, on the other hand, is what Greg Stafford has said is an evolution: from the best emulation of Glorantha with a D&amp;Dish sort of system, to a system that supports Glorantha directly as he envisions it. Characterization is about selecting keywords that define the character in large chunks, and then tailoring the character with additional abilities. These abilities can be anything from "Intimidating Beard" (to use a favorite) to "Run Up Cliff Spell" to "Loves Brunhilda" to "Spear of Darkfar." Anything you can imagine.<br/>
<br/>
This makes it very easy to tailor your character. Chargen is simple if you want to just choose from already written up keywords, or you can decide to make your own keywords and get into a whole lot of detail on what it means to you for a character to be from Boldhome vs. from Whitehall. The usual keywords are Homeland (including Religion), Occupation, and Magic. What's fascinating is how two characters each with the same keywords can be drastically different from each other. To say nothing of characters with different keywords. So the keywords are just aids in character creation, not straightjackets.<br/>
<br/>
There are actually three methods for building a character. One is to write a 100 word narrative about the character, from which you can pick out abilities. Another is simply to list them. And yet another is to make up your character in play "As You Go."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
More importantly, the system tends to bring out the character you create in play. A fight can be as much about who your character is protecting as it is about how well he uses a sword. A character's Grim Determination can make all the difference in many contests. People may well learn to fear your character and his Intimidating Beard. Your character's dedication to his deity may be what makes the difference in a long-distance run.<br/>
<br/>
You tend to learn more about the character with each contest.<br/>

Lots of characters there to check out. If you want to see it in action, check into the Indie Netgaming IRC chat room where we play a lot: <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23indierpgs&amp;Mode=like">#indierpgs</a> on linuxguy.magicstar.net<br/>
<br/>
Come on over and lurk, and we can show you what it's about.<br/>

                            It's a rules-light foundation that has many elaborations, mostly in the area of magic.

                            [Now I've crossed with Fred - note that he's played in my HQ game, I've played in one run by him, Shreyas and I both play in another run by Thomas Robertson...]<br/>
<br/>
To answer your specific questions:<br/>
<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">
<div class="QuoteText">What is the relative weight of the system?</div>
</blockquote>
Any weight of the system is tied up in the setting information. So nothing onerous. Very light in action. Most contests are resolved by comparing two d20 rolls against targets, and "bumping" with mastery or "Hero Points" (which also drive character development).<br/>
<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">
<div class="QuoteText">I'm not particularly tied to the Glorantha setting, though it is the kind of setting that gets my particular geek on. How integral to the rules is the setting?</div>
</blockquote>
The magic systems are sorta integral to the setting, though I'd challenge even that. Put another way, I play HQ in Shadow World (an old ICE setting for Rolemaster), and it works great. I haven't seen a fantasy setting yet for which it would not excel.<br/>
<br/>
(OH, yeah, and I'm involved in writing the "generic" version of the game right now called "Quest Worlds" so there's a little more disclosure for you.)<br/>
<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">
<div class="QuoteText">What is the GM workload like? What is prep time and requirements?</div>
</blockquote>
Well the text presents as somewhat traditional here. But what everyone agrees on is that you don't have to do any pre-statting of stuff. So prep is just what you need to come up with ideas for people, places, events, etc. Again my personal experience is that I can play with no prep at all most nights.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, I run a version called "Other World" where we start without a world at all, much less characters.<br/>
<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">
<div class="QuoteText">Both games feature a veritable dumpload of suppliments. How vital are these to the game? Am I going to be on the hook for all twenty/thirty/hundred and twelve books to fully appreciate the game?</div>
</blockquote>
I don't see either game as requiring the supplements much. They're basically all adventure material or supplemental setting info for Glorantha.<br/>
<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">
<div class="QuoteText">What, exactly, makes the game amazing?</div>
</blockquote>
Magic feels magical. And players play their characters heroically.<br/>
<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">
<div class="QuoteText">Are there great tools for, as an example, situation generation?</div>
</blockquote>
No situation generation per se, but there are "relationships" and "community" rules from which situation tends to spring by itself. It's like a situation generator in play without the need for prep. Or, at least that's how it works for me.<br/>
<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">
<div class="QuoteText">What behaviors does the game reward and how?</div>
</blockquote>
The reward system is actually pretty light, but the contest system rewards creatively interpreting your character in play. Finding new facets about the character. Exploring who they are, and what they'll do when things they value come into play.<br/>
<br/>
All linked to the setting that you play in, Glorantha or not. If you want to bring a setting to life, HQ is your game.<br/>

What? I may be mistaken, but I think you've confused the new <b>Mongoose</b> edition of Runequest for a d20 game. (Also GR has apparently made some supplements for "MRQ", but the game is published by Mongoose.)<br><br>Speaking for Runequest/BRP, I think it's a fine system but I doubt it's what King Turnip is looking for. On top of that, the Mongoose edition has been criticized for sloppy editing and annoying publishing decisions.                        </br></br></div>

<br/>
Why they'd need another BRP edition of RQ, however... Anyhow, from reviews of the material I've seen (and even read), it comes off just as BRP always did, which is pretty D&amp;Dish. Sans the leveling up, but with "powering up" through skill use.<br/>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Why they'd need another BRP edition of RQ, however...</blockquote>
Because the original is way OOP and still has plenty of utility for fantasy/swords &amp; sorcery gaming? Though, after some initial enthusiasm, I passed on purchase. The Mongoose edition is supposedly reverse-engineered, by the way and technically not even BRP, for legal reasons. Chaosium has a Deluxe BRP planned for the near future, which might be interesting to compare.
<blockquote>Anyhow, from reviews of the material I've seen (and even read), it comes off just as BRP always did, which is pretty D&amp;Dish. Sans the leveling up, but with "powering up" through skill use.</blockquote>Depends on what you find important in differentiating games. Most RPGs use "powering up". (Yes, I know that's not a safe assumption around here.) Aside from that and the mechanical focus on combat, I don't see much similarity to D&amp;D--at least in earlier editions of both games.                        </div>

                            You want HeroQuest. It's a landmark in narrative game publishing. It provides powerful Narrativist gameplay, but with very high Exploration, unlike many such games. The original Hero Wars edition really reshaped my conception of conflict resolution and abstraction in game mechanics. I cannot speak highly enough to how HeroQuest should be on your game shelf.<br><br>Reviews I'm reading of the new RuneQuest lead me to believe it's a Bad Idea. It's a regurgitation of a (admittedly well-loved) couple-decades-old system. It seems targeted at players who are interested in Glorantha but actively not interested in newfangled storygaming. From what I can tell, this criteria doesn't seem to apply to you.<br><br>Of course, you're going to get a pretty skewed response asking at a place called Story Games.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            I don't want to get folks over-eager with some post that says that the game is "coming soon." But it is not vaporware. An end is definitely in sight. Heck, I'll go so far as to actually admit that I myself am holding up things longer than anyone in the process at this point in time. So if you want to get it published sooner, go ahead and bug me about it.<br/>
<br/>
It's not a secret that part of the problem in getting the game out has been that the project staff has changed, and that Issaries gave the lisence up to Moon Design, which caused some delays in the hand-over process. But the project has not once ceased in it's production.<br/>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Merten</cite>The Mongoose-published setting book, Glorantha - The Second age, is supposed to be a very exemplar setting book, while HeroQuest was quite hard to approach setting-wise. Is it so? I've only read reviews of the former and banged my head to the wall for a little while with the latter.</blockquote>
The Heroquest main book is not particularly well organized. This particularly creates hurdles for the setting and different flavors of magic (which, for Glorantha, are practically inseparable). You're frequently tossed technical vocabulary without an indicator that they are technical terms (grimoires vs. spells vs. charms vs. talents vs. feats vs. ...) so it's very easy to get mixed up pretty quickly. I found that the Lunars vs. Heortlings setting info didn't provide quite enough depth to really dig into and use.<br><br>I didn't really latch on to Heroquest until I bought the first Lunar Empire book on a whim. Suddenly, the heart of some of Glorantha's complexities, contradictions and conflicts were presented in an accessible and concise fashion. Thunder Rebels is good too, but denser and harder to find in print.                        </br></br></div>

                            I definitely concur that HQ is a wonderful system for quite wide-open play, although Robin Laws also crafted one which allows for a surprising degree of rulesy depth, if you want to get under the hood.<br>
<br>
The core HQ book is certainly Gloranthacentric, but universalising it is a cinch. That said, I would be remiss if I didn't pimp my own Mythic Russia, which takes the core game engine to a very different setting and includes various optional additions and streamlinings.<br>
