Nearby, a water feature / sound sculpture semi-randomly tolled its bells, petitioning heaven to grant deliverance to the poor souls of Montsegur.<br/><br/>Our table was clearly more juiced by the family and sex stuff than by the religion and war stuff.  I had Raimonde/Amiel.  The others were:<br/><br/>Brendan: Arsende (Bertrand)<br/>Twyla: Corba (Bernard)<br/>Christian: Phillipa (Faye)<br/>Lesley: Garnier (Roger)<br/>Jackson: Esclarmonde (Cecile)<br/><br/>This is an all-star lineup that justified the expense of Gamestorm by itself.<br/><br/>I'd kinda be interested in knowing how frequently characters are chosen in the entire universe of M1244 play.  Seems like the last few APs I've read have been family/sex ones.<br/><br/>I believe that only Jackson and I had played before, and each of us only once.  The game taught itself well, and we had a smooth if bloody proceeding.  Three secondary characters perished before the Inquisition got to us.<br/><br/>Religion was not a huge force for our main characters.  They were too busy slaughtering secondaries and humping each other to bother with the Perfects.  Corba may have taken consolamentum, but she did so offscreen.  Cecile showed up a tiny bit in one scene, and then Philippa traded her out as a hostage.<br/><br/>Game time was about 4.5-5 hours.  We broke after Act 1 and skipped the Act 2 break; that was how the bathroom breaks scheduled themselves.<br/><br/>I played the only story card, the Hospitaller one.  The good Hospitaller tried to get Fay and Arsende to avenge Amiel's death by luring mad Bertrand to the crusaders.  Nothing happened as a result of this; Arsende's plans were advanced far beyond the crude intrigue proposed by the peacemaking knight.<br/><br/>There were maybe six scene grabs.  I used all mine and I know Jackson used at least a couple of his.<br/><br/>I think that Esclarmonde was the main character of our game.  She was the focus of the very first scene, was the pivot in the major love triangle, and made the choice at the end that we exited on.<br/><br/>The rest of this AP is game fiction.  Whenever I read an M1244 AP, I always want to see how my old characters were interpreted by other people, so I want to capture this in case anyone else does the same.<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>* The Inquisitor dies dutifully in the prelude.  Pierre Roger doesn't want witnesses, so they gank the Inquisitor's secret lover too.  His secret lover is the Countess of Toulose.  This will complicate things later. <br/><br/>* Inspired by a blood-in-the-stream card, Corba kicks us off with a flashback.  We go back to when Phillipa and Esclarmonde are young girls, merrily dragging their very pregnant mother and her ladies-in-watiing around.  Corba miscarries and delivers a stillborn boy.  The hysterical lady-in-waiting drags Esclarmonde by the hair and forces her to look at her dead brother, who floats in the stream.  It is Esclarmonde's fault the boy is dead, the servant screeches, because Esclaramonde cannot be silent and still.  Later, Corba has the lady-in-waiting thrown from the bluff.<br/><br/>* From then on, Esclarmonde expresses little interest in motherhood.<br/><br/>* From then on, every lady-in-waiting or midwife seen in the story is treated like complete shit by the entire cast.<br/><br/>* Old Bertrand goes gunning for the 'demon-child' Amiel, and gives him a beating for whatever reason.  But Amiel fights back!  He blames mad old Bertrand for his parents' death, and he stabs the Perfect with a wooden spear. The wound festers, and for the next ten months, the old man's body slowly rots to death.  Amiel is not disiplined for this attack, as Arsende is busy with other things and Raimonde is secretly gleeful when he hears of it.   Bertrand is marginalized through much of the game.<br/><br/>* Bernard, lusty and senseless from drink one night, bursts into Arsende's shack and falls not upon Arsende, but rather upon her lover Esclarmonde.  This is intolerable, so Arsende bushwhacks the boozy knight and hides his sodden corpse in Raimonde's secret escape tunnel.<br/><br/>* Everybody knows about Raimonde's secret escape tunnel.  <br/><br/>* Raimonde does not know this.<br/><br/>* Bertrand, his painful wound making him both mad and immune to irony, oversees a furious inquiry into Bernard's death.  Esclarmonde manipulates Amiel into demanding a duel with the old Perfect.  The challenge is delivered, but before it can be enacted, Garnier throws the boy into the river to cool him off.  Alas, the scamp develops pneumonia and dies.  Bertrand is satisfied and ends the investigation.  Esclarmonde is good at this!<br/><br/>* Esclarmonde finds Garnier in the snow-covered meadow, flagellating himself for a reason I don't catch -- their conversation is whispered and intense.  Whatever Esclarmonde says, it braces the archer, because he casts aside the whip and dashes off to attend to his duties with new vigor.   Esclarmonde is good at this!<br/><br/>* Arsende has a sex den in the secret tunnel and has overheard Lord Raimonde's plans for escape.  She escapes herself and betrays the tunnel to her cousin, the vengeful Count of Toulose, who acceeds to her conditions, reestablishing all her noble privilege.  Warm and fed for the first time in months, Arsende decides not to return to Montsegur.<br/><br/>* With the secret tunnel compromised, the castle defenses crumble.  As the surrender is negotiated, Esclarmonde fruitlessly searches the castle for Arsende, lingering over every place she and her lover ever warmed together.  Jackson nailed this moment in a monologue like I have never before heard in tabletop.  It was hideously sad and beautiful. <br/><br/>* Raimonde discovers that Pierre Roger knew that all in the castle knew of the existence of the secret tunnel.  He is angry that Roger did not tell him this.  Roger suggests that the loose lips belonged to Raimonde's family.  Enraged by his helplessness, the seigneur demands that Roger atone for his failures by surrendering himself to Montsegur's executioner.  Roger refuses, and Raimonde orders the few soldiers that are left to kill Roger.  Roger goes down fighting, killing several of the men he once commanded.<br/><br/>* Arsende, who recanted painlessly, watches from a position of privilege as the faithful go to their fate.  No one chooses to escape into the night.<br/><br/>* For Lady Corba, the fire is a welcome end to thirty years of post-miscarriage depression.  Next up is Lord Raimonde, the man who swore the foolish oath of shelter to the faithful, the man who placed his defense in the hands of an ineffectual, sex-addled son-in-law.  Knowing that posterity will judge him poorly, the seigneur is defiant.  He proclaims he does not care if he is a poor Catholic, because he knows that he is an excellent and honorable Frenchman.  He burns.<br/><br/>* Everyone else recants.  The clueless Garnier is especially eager to return to the mother church, but his heart breaks when Esclarmonde recants, then walks past him to join her true love.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>This was a ton of fun for me.

She was unaware of his affair with Arsende (and he was unaware that her child was Bernand's), so after he dies, she is heartbroken and loses the last of her faith that had been shaken by the events throughout.  She takes the baby and walks out through the snow, the church in flames behind her, the fire lighting her way; Corba decided to burn it down rather than let it fall into Catholic hands, and Raimonde joined her.  She and the Catholics re-baptize the child to change his name from Raimonde to Pierre.<br/><br/>There were so many cool little details and moments about the game that it would take too long to talk about them all, but they'll definitely stick with me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_264295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lesleymac" title="lesleymac"><img alt="lesleymac" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3058/2439071745_ae7aa89c06_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lesleymac">lesleymac</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264295/#Comment_264295" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-28T20:26:58+00:00" title="March 28, 2010  8:26PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That was an awesome game! Definitely worth the price of admission.<br/>\n<br/>\nGarnier feels horribly guilty over the death of Amiel. He has a soft spot for children, and never really ascribed to the theory that they are demons. So when his actions cause Amiel's death, he has a hard time getting over it. But when he talks to Esclarmonde, she convinces him that he can find forgiveness (or at least forgetfulness) in action. He asks her to run away with him, and dreams of a life with her. He forswears himself to Lord Raimonde, and instead sticks around waiting for Esclarmonde.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought it was interesting that I was playing a religious man who wasn't good, and a non-religious man who was good. It was interesting to see what happened to them. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe tone was much darker than I was expecting, but we were all on the same page, and told an awesome story together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264376/#Comment_264376" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-29T11:54:13+00:00" title="March 29, 2010 11:54AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 29, 2010 1:23PM by Brendan.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "All-star lineup" is right!  It was a privilege to play with you guys.  Thanks for the great writeup, Johnzo.<br/><br/>It was interesting that the Cathar/Catholic fight got so sidelined in our game; I kept picking up story cards for cool inquisitors and generals arriving on the side of the besiegers, but didn't bother using them because things were already so hot and bloody inside the castle walls.  Most of us seemed to have ingrained a certain set of story-game habits/tools--pounce on the R-map, go for the throat, make life hell for your character or set them up to fall--that generate conflict with or without an external threat.<br/><br/>I might have given <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Bernard</span> Bertrand short shrift; his character has details that imply more than just burning zealotry, but once I saw the "children are demons" aspect of the Cathar faith on the info card, I couldn't keep myself from going for that candy.  Arsende, meanwhile, was positioned so beautifully in the center of the web that I didn't even let Johnzo finish reading her description before I grabbed her.<br/><br/>Particular contributions I wanted to applaud:  Lesley for great description of the struggle during the assassination, and (I think) for the bloody-minded willingness to kill the Countess and make it look like a murder-suicide; Jackson for that monologue and his instant buy-in when I opened my scene with "Esclarmonde collapses onto Arsende's mattress;" Christian for Phillipa's immensely symbolic decision to rebaptize and rename her son; Johnzo for the sheer pride and blindness of Raimonde the patriarch, which left huge openings for the rest of us to drive through; and Twyla, for running us through that opening miscarriage scene in two minutes of beautiful horror that set the tone for the whole game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_264389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.
