For one, the presentation of races. The Andorians in TOS were what the Klingons became in TNG, The Klingons in TOS were what the Romulans became in TNG. This was striking to me, as everything I've read about Klingons presents them as the honourable warrior race they were changed to (along with massive forehead ridges) in TNG, and it's as if the old ones never existed. The Cadet's book also covers Star Trek jargon as well as game terms.<br/><br/>The Star Fleet Officer's Manual is game rules and character generation. At its core it's a percentile system, but it's actually handled in a quite interesting fashion. 0 is unskilled, 1-9 is semi-skilled, and 10-99 is skilled (with different designations at various points between someone who's just proficient and someone who's a leader in the field). What's interesting is that for the most part you don't roll to use any skill, success is automatic, unless your level is from 1-9 in which case you roll 1d10. If it's an unusual or stressful situation then you'd roll for any skill on 1d100. I like this setup and I think it's quite suitable - for general day to day operations of a starship the characters are perfectly competent, but since they're always encountering new worlds, spatial anomalies and the like, they're quite unprepared, so having an average 40% or so success rate for someone who's quite good at what they do is perfectly reasonable. <br/><br/>Percentile skill systems also seem quite suited to Star Trek, things are always talked about in percentages (Shields at 67%!), and since officers go through the academy having everything based on fixed skills that would be courses taken is also completely appropriate. Being able to compare various levels is also important as it's quite normal to be picking the character who's best at something (shuttle piloting for example) for a particular mission. There are times that I feel that while a percentile skill system is easy to understand and straightforward, it doesn't really fit (like HarnMaster), but with Star Trek I feel it's probably one of the most appropriate options (although I think GumShoe might do the trick too given how Star Trek plots are often investigations into social issues with success at the end of the episode denoted by a monologue by one of the bridge crew). <br/><br/>Charcter generation is a bit long and involved, but I like that it states 40% is average for humans, and since stats are rolled on 3d10+40, it actually guarantees every star fleet officer is above average at the minimum, so it completely sidesteps some of the pitfalls of random stat generation. It has a few different races, and where humans thrive is luck (the stat). Luck really comes in for ship assignments in tours of duty and operating reports. This means Constitution class ships are most likely to be crewed by humans, while other ships are more likely to be crewed by nonhumans. It reflects the show, and while it was obviously due to make up budgets, it's a rather interesting light that casts on Star Trek given how diverse and egalitarian it is. It'd be interesting, depending on the characters chosen, to have a rather small science vessel crewed almost entirely by nonhumans.<br/><br/>What I like is the life path system, with tours of duty. It's not the quickest by any means, taking well over half an hour to make a character, but at least it's worth it as you see how your skills increase, and that gives you a back story, as well as a variety of places you get stationed. It also gives an opportunity to match up different characters to see if they crewed together on a ship (although given the nature of ship assignments there's much less need to find a reason for the party to be working together than for other games).<br/><br/>I haven't looked at the combat mechanics in too much detail, it's a square grid based system using action points, which I guess was appropriate for the time but doesn't really feel like Star Trek to me. Interestingly it has Opportunity Actions, which I was previously only aware of in Combat &amp; Tactics and d20.<br/><br/>The Game Operations Manual I haven't looked over in too much detail yet either, I jumped straight to the section for rolling up new planets and alien species. Getting strange results and trying to explain them seems very Star Trek to me, and having to think up a reason for the 10th planet from the star being a warm temperate climate with 1.2G and a thin atmosphere, 74% land mass and the dominant species being non-sentient small birds was an interesting challenge. <br/><br/>All in all, it's a nice little gem, and I'm quite impressed with what they did. I'm less and less surprised these days to see a percentile system stand the test of time, and this is just another example of it being a really solid workhorse mechanic.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282608/#Comment_282608" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-23T09:31:05+00:00" title="July 23, 2010  9:31AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pics, or it didn't happen!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282625/#Comment_282625" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-23T10:51:58+00:00" title="July 23, 2010 10:51AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is it that hard to find?

Rather than find the clues to see who did it, it's find the clues to see what the real world social issue analogue is. In the TNG episode "The Outcast" there's a rather obvious gender bending question, but the subtext could be applied to questions about asylum and religious rights of parents over their kids. The interesting twist is that there isn't necessarily a wrong answer, as the intended subtext might not be the one that's announced at the end of the session, but nonetheless the whole point is to navigate a rather interesting social issue and hear some or all of the players deliver a speech at the end announcing the core issue in game, followed by half an hour to an hour discussion after words about how it relates to current social issues we face in the real world.<br/><br/>The first couple seasons of DS9 are similar, but it develops into a more standard war sci-fi series. Voyager also seems to be more a question of morality rather than looking at individual social issues. TOS was more of an exploration of what it means to be human and about human potential.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonP" title="JasonP"><img alt="JasonP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wishray.com/jp/the_penguin.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonP">JasonP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282704/#Comment_282704" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-23T17:38:17+00:00" title="July 23, 2010  5:38PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have some fond memories of actually playing this game in my high school years, but more than that I fell in love with the rather weak but quite fun FASA Star Trek Tactical Simulator.

Players really avoided getting into gun combat, because getting hit usually meant your character was dead. Most characters had 50-80 endurance (their hit points), and one hit from a disruptor did 80 points, and a hit from a phaser did 160... So fist fights were common, but the tension *really* ramped up when a gun came out, and players planned to avoid such situations.<br/><br/>Aside from that, the game did have a very interesting implementation of opportunity actions. There as table of actions, like move 1 squre, run 3 squares, dive for cover, aim phaser, fire phaser, melee attack, etc. With each action taking, say from 1-4 AP out for your total of 10-14. Many, many of the actions had an asterisk next to them (fire phaser did, but aim didn't), which meant if anyone else did one of those actions, you could interrupt and take an action of yours.<br/>So, for instance, you could move a square, which could trigger a couple of opportunity actions from other players (like diving for cover, firing phasers, etc). With players who had copies of the table, or knew the system, It produced a genuinely fluid serious of actions that felt like simultaneous action.<br/><br/>I played a couple of campaigns, and found several of the adventures did an excellent job of emulating the feel of the TOS - not sure why the poster above said they didn't feel like Star Trek. But I grew up with TOS not TNG.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
