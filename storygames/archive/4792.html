We had two players, Stranger, who played the Sith fleet, and Akast, who played the Republic fleet, and me, the referee, extras, and descriptions/stage props person. For the basic setup and issues, see an <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3428" rel="nofollow">earlier post</a> I made about it. <br/><br/>It was the Republic's turn to Raise. I cut to the bridge of the Tamarr, the flagship of the Republic fleet. The fleet commander, Admiral Leverier, has now realized the head of the Sith fleet, Darth Priat, is deliberately aiming for mutual attrition. Leverier wants to end this quickly as possible and decides to send in the Jedi to capture the enemy flagship, Darth Priat's Checkmate. He also wants the takeover to be as bloodless as possible, and so sends over the technical wizzes of the Republic's engineer corps. <br/><br/>We decided to complete the Raise narration with another cutscene. I cut to a scene with a bunch of Jedi, the two players and I each making up or grabbing a random Jedi, calming each other's nerves, wishing the Force on each other, etc. before boarding the lander. <br/><br/>Now that the Raise is complete, we cut to the Checkmate's bridge for the See. I play the hapless operator while Stranger plays Darth Priat. The Jedi strike force is spotted coming towards the Checkmate, something Darth Priat really doesn't want to deal with right now. He could order Darth Cedess, his nominal subordinate, to intercept the Jedi with his flagship, the Vengeance... but the two Sith Lords are bitter rivals and he's sure Darth Cedess is going to disobey him. (Ever wonder how the Sith always manage to lose in the end with better equipment and greater numbers?) Being the devious Sith Lord he is, Darth Priat decides to try a bit of reverse psychology. I played the role of his aide-de-camp while the Sith Lord worked out this little plan. <br/><br/>Cut to the bridge of the Vengeance. Stranger, this time playing Darth Cedess, receives an order from Darth Priat to take the directed route to take over the enemy flagship, the Tamarr. Darth Cedess can't believe his archrival would hand him such an opportunity for glory and orders the hapless operator (played by me) to check for any traps in the route. The operator sees--surprise--a Jedi lander! Darth Cedess decides he'll double his glory in battle by taking on the Jedi strike force <i>and</i> the enemy flagship, Darth Priat's orders be damned, and plays neatly into Darth Priat's hands in the process. <br/><br/>The See concluded, we did another cutscene to play out the results of the Raise and See. Stranger played the pilot of the Jedi lander, and reported that the Vengeance is moving to intercept. I played Calena Hallack, the Jedi Knight in charge of the lander, and Akast played Ramel Nelos, an inexperienced Knight. Calena asks if the Vengeance has spotted the engineer corps lander, the players and I confer to decide the answer is no, and Calena makes the call that they would engage with the Vengeance to draw the attention of the Sith so the engineers can take over the Checkmate stealthily and on their own. Then they land on the Vengeance, the battle begins, and we cut to the engineer corps guys dealing with the same situation. The Raise, See, and results concluded, we moved on to the Sith fleet's Raise, beginning once again on the bridge of the Checkmate... and so on. <br/><br/>So that's an example of the way we played out a space battle with Dogs in the Vineyard. We played pretty fast and loose, adding an extra scene when we felt it was needed, glossing over some scenes with a summary in the interests of time and pacing (too bad we never saw much of the Sith's Mandalorian allies). We did keep generally to the Raise and See structure, and made sure to describe the actual human decisions and effects with a cutscene whenever dramatically appropriate, "zooming in" to specific parts of the conflict. Overall it was a kick-ass experience. The combination of the large-scale Raises and Sees and the cutscenes where those decisions take shape and effect turned out to be a pretty effective way of expressing both the scale and human intimacy of a large conflict. <br/><br/>We did this macro-Conflict thing four more times so far, this time with large-scale political conflicts, and the last three times they were three-way conflicts between Big Evil Corporation, the Scared and Violent Settlers, and the Persecuted Native Populace. (We had a "no discussing real-world politics" rule firmly in place.) It was a good way to fill in background events or to do something campaign-related when a player couldn't make it. Depending on how campaign events go we may end the entire campaign with another giant space battle, not with a whimper but a bang.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107812/#Comment_107812" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-11T14:35:17+00:00" title="November 11, 2007  2:35PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds pretty exciting!<br/><br/>One question: did the escalation rules factor into the space battle at all, or did you just start at a deadly level of conflict right away?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107822/#Comment_107822" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-11T16:59:42+00:00" title="November 11, 2007  4:59PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Sounds pretty exciting!<br/><br/>One question: did the escalation rules factor into the space battle at all, or did you just start at a deadly level of conflict right away?</blockquote>\nYeah, it was fun! The escalation rule did factor into the Conflict. The battle started off with the two fleet commanders in a chest-thumping match, wihch was Acuity + Heart. Later on there was a close-range skirmish between jet fighters, which we decided to handle with Body + Will. When they started breaking out the capital ships and the heavy fire, that was Acuity + Will, though we'd rolled all the Stats dice by then. We didn't roll the Fallout we accrued since this was a one-off thing, and because we weren't sure how to "heal" a fleet that was falling apart if the Fallout was serious. Maybe we could have done another macro-conflict for that, which would have been interesting, but we needed to get back to the regular campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

We did roll Fallout and change the sheets when we played three political conflicts in a row between three groups. The really awkward moment came after the third and last conflict, when one of the groups rolled size 12 Fallout and failed the Body check, necessitating immediate "medical attention" to "survive." Since the Fallout dice were small (3d6) we handled it briefly and offscreen, with one of the PCs summarizing her Raises and Sees sitting down with people in the community to prevent it from falling apart from panic and internal strife.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
