But I struggle with darkness and light sources.<br/><br/>Even when an area is meant to be dark, I end up running it as a lighted area, or do so the moment anyone turns on a flashlight. Part of the issue is remembering, but it is also because I just don't know how to run light level stuff. I suspect the issue is, in part, because darkness, unlike the cold, is a "lack". I can do fog fine, because at least it's something to look at.<br/><br/>I don't use figurines or boards with measured squares for actual light distances, and I have little interest in doing so. I'm more interested in narrative and evocative ways invoking light dynamics. <br/><br/>So I was wondering if any of you have any tips/tricks/techniques or generally non-system specific mechanics that help run darkness. Or if anyone else has similar issues!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460962/#Comment_460962" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-07T10:43:25+00:00" title="March  7, 2017 10:43AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my experience this is a common GMing foible. I've only seen proper light handling at disciplined old school D&amp;D tables, and even then I often have to be the one to bring the discipline myself. I think much of the difficulty springs from the fact that lighting is not comprehended as an actual element of the play experience, so many players would much rather ignore it as an issue altogether. I certainly do when I'm not playing either a realist (in literary terms) atmospheric game or a tactical wargame.<br/><br/>Do you have personal first-hand experience with low-light conditions and using various types of light sources in-doors and out-doors? Camping situation or such, maybe. I ask because I think much about what I personally do in this regard is based on direct experience. I imagine it would be much more difficult if I'd never experienced these sorts of things myself.<br/><br/>As a general exercise, you might try to practice with a simple heuristic: whenever characters are using artificial light sources in an environment not specifically designed for the light source, assume that everything they perceive is "shadowy", or whatever word you would use for that in English. Then, apply the following principles to everything you describe for them:<br/><b>*</b> Only outlines of shapes and expansive flat surfaces may be perceived. To see any details or colors you have to bring the light closer (or point it directly at a detail, with a modern flashlight).<br/><b>*</b> The lack of detail makes perspective uncertain, which causes uncertainty in evaluating distances, sizes and other spatial relationships.<br/><b>*</b> Any movement is either slow and deliberate, or panicked and hazardous. The only exceptions are familiar places.<br/><br/>The key point about the above heuristic is that it applies <i>all the time</i>, no matter the perceived dramatic quality of the scene: it doesn't matter whether a PC is looking for the outhouse at night or exploring an ancient temple ruin, you as the GM need to cognitively switch on the "shadowy" mindset and start describing perception and action accordingly. This idea of there being a single "mode" of bad-lightning conditions should help you remember to picture situations as badly-lighted; the details of <i>how</i> dark it is are essentially entirely secondary, momentary and subjective in comparison, and should be ignored for now.<br/><br/>(How dark is dark? Because the human eye adapts to low-light conditions, and because light sources easily prevent this, and because many everyday actions - e.g. reading - require much more light than others, it is generally true that you won't stray far as a GM if you simply ignore the minutiae of light simulation and focus on the above issue: is it shadowy here or not? If it's not, just treat it as a non-issue. If it is, just treat it as shadowy, and deal with any and every practical question on a case-by-case basis. Does a player demand to see better because they have a better lamp? Let them, it doesn't matter - what matters is that you are actually acknowledging the light question at all.)<br/><br/>The reason for why I think that this trick might help you is that people apparently tend to under-estimate the importance of illumination for doing many of the things that rpg characters often do. It is an usual assumption that <i>any</i> amount of light will suffice, perhaps because people do not actually want to deal with the light question; a candle or torch becomes a sort of a prop that justifies why we do not talk about light anymore.<br/><br/>However, in reality just about every place is "shadowy" at night, with the specific exception of human-constructed rooms with illumination designed specifically for that room. By having a solid set of rules for what happens in shadowy conditions (as per above), and by deciding that everywhere all the time is shadowy unless it's daytime, you should find it easier to feel the impact of illumination on scenes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pacmouf" title="Pacmouf"><img alt="Pacmouf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pacmouf">Pacmouf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460967/#Comment_460967" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-07T12:00:19+00:00" title="March  7, 2017 12:00PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for sharing your thoughts! I like the idea of a "shadowy descriptive mode" a lot. It makes describing darkness on the fly easy, since as a GM you generate what is in (say) a room quickly enough, but in this case describe it through your shadow filter. I will write down those three principles to glance at in session.<br/><br/>I have a lot of experience camping and low-light situations so I ought to be able to imagine this stuff easily enough ^.^ .<br/><br/>By giving only giving outlines and shapes it also makes the player "do" lighting. If they have something like a flashlight, they can ask to shine their light on the shapes in the room they want to see more of, which is always better than one-way, GM to player, description. <br/><br/>Your point about movement is good too--emphasizing the slowness of movement normally, or bumping into stuff, knocking over things in the dark if players move more quickly. <br/><br/>I wonder about the role of imagination too. Humans are notorious pattern finders, and part of the eeriness of darkness is misidentified or imagined shapes. I've been trying to get better at adding interpretive uncertainty to descriptions, if only to seed possible interpretations in the players mind. I've mostly done so in social situations "they tilt their head to the side, like they're thinking about your proposition. Or maybe they've realized that you've been lying to them this whole time", but the same principle could apply to vision, "there is a small, person sized tree-like shape at the far end. Wait, maybe it is a person just standing there, stock still. You're not sure"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460968/#Comment_460968" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-07T12:24:24+00:00" title="March  7, 2017 12:24PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I like vagueness as a rhetorical effect a lot. I use it both in auteuristic horror games (the ones where my job is basically to do whatever, just entertain and scare everybody) and tactical dungeoneering ones (where it's an issue of realistic fog of war). And exactly as you say, in this context it is an open invitation for interaction to the players: if something looks vaguely threatening or strange, perhaps you'll want to bring a torch closer, or point your flashlight directly at it? This sort of detailed micromanagement of character action is great for getting a sharp and immediate sense of the moment, for whatever purpose a particular game might use that.<br/><br/>Thinking about what it is exactly that I do, a big part of it is sticking to a first person viewpoint in describing things: while reeling out your description of a place or a thing or whatever, think in terms of character viewpoint. It's not a question of what it <i>is</i> that you're describing, but rather a question of what the observer <i>sees</i>. Once you get in that mind-set, it's even easier to remember to bring in the illumination issue: you imagine the place, you remember that it's dark, you modify your inner image accordingly, and then describe what it is that they see. This is, admittedly, a second-order concern that a GM should engage in only once they are actually capable of giving lively and detailed descriptions of things. (I've been playing in a Call of Cthulhu game lately where the GM has difficulties with basic description - I certainly would not recommend trying for first-person sensibilities in that situation, it's enough to concentrate on actually giving a solid description in the first place.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460973/#Comment_460973" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-07T13:59:02+00:00" title="March  7, 2017  1:59PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, Eero covered all of the really good bits.<br/><br/>The only part I'll point out is something pointed out to me once, but which has never yet come up in a game, which makes some things even more awful.<br/><br/>A light source, in low light conditions, can be seen much further away than the useful illumination it provides to the people holding it, if you have direct line of sight to it.<br/><br/>Suddenly fantasy humanoids who can see decently in the dark become much, much scarier to those poor humans stumbling around with their lanterns.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460991/#Comment_460991" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-07T21:22:11+00:00" title="March  7, 2017  9:22PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great points. I think it's worth remembering that having a light source is useful, but also destroys your "night vision", and that's not something you can just "turn on and off". Changes in darkness/light, especially sudden exposure to light in a dark space, is very shocking and disorienting.<br/><br/>One thing you could play up as a practical concern is the lack of ability a person has in the dark to immediately identify things. It takes a while, sometimes, to look at something, and to try to gauge what exactly it is. That can be made "gameable" - you see a dark shape moving to the left, behind the rock: do you want to shoot now, or try to wait until you can identify whether it's human? Those are actionable decisions - everything takes a little longer (if it is even possible).<br/><br/>Playing with the imagination is trickier. We always imagine things in the dark, and it's hard to sort out what's real. I have yet to see a GM or a game that handles that well. It could be as simple, however, as indicating to the players that you will regularly misrepresent things when they're in the dark, unless they have special abilities, shine a light on it, or make efforts (and spend time) trying to identify them.<br/><br/>That brings me to another point:<br/><br/>When you're considering the representation of darkness in a game, what is your goal?<br/><br/>Is it verisimilitude? Is it to provide a different tactical environment? Is it to challenge the players? Is it to have an emotional impact on the players (e.g. to make them feel disoriented or frightened)?<br/><br/>All of those things will call for different techniques and approaches, so give those questions a thought when you apply this to a particular game.<br/><br/>In one case, you might be looking to make it hard for people to know what they're actually seeing, to make them feel like they can't trust their own senses. In a tactical game, though, your priority should be to communicate as clearly as possible (especially about ambiguous points - why is it that I can't tell who that is? Is he just out of the range of the lantern-light?, for instance). Those are very different needs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461015/#Comment_461015" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-08T18:52:19+00:00" title="March  8, 2017  6:52PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had great fun using lack of visibility as an actual challenge.  Rolling for how far off course everyone gets, handling split groups in separate parts so they might run into each other, describing only sounds, etc.  If everyone in the group buys in and either tackles the problems or revels in the experience, it's great!
