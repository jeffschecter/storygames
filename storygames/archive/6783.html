They were a group of kids (12-14?) who knew each other from before, so it was easy to see the group dynamic. An adult friend of mine joined the group, too.<br/><br/>The characters were three demons and a magician - who had little control over his demons. I gave the quiet boy at the bottom of the pecking order the biggest, strongest demon, so he'd have some oomph. The most vocal of the kids got a fairly minor demon - I knew he'd be all right anyway. The adult player got the magician, because I knew he was mature enough to handle a character who was constantly losing face and getting no respect from his demons. <br/><br/>It worked well; the quiet kid got a lot of action, although, of course, his friends often tried to tell him what to do. And the kids all liked challenging the authority of the adult player, who acted confused and surprised whenever they messed things up for him.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150969/#Comment_150969" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-16T02:36:45+00:00" title="June 16, 2008  2:36AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 16, 2008 2:40AM by Graham.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Paul, it's not a bad way. It provokes conversation. It's difficult enough to get a table of geek strangers talking, but give them a bunch of characters and they'll talk nicely.<br/><br/>If someone claims a character too soon, just say "Let's talk about it some more before claiming characters. What does everyone else want to play?". Make sure you've asked everyone who they want to play, including the less assertive characters, then assign them.<br/><br/>I still have nightmares about a fat Scottish tosser claiming the character I wanted during a game. He did it using the words "I'll stick with this character".

Also, I've found myself doing some social engineering, taking time to explain why the characters who were chosen last are central and amazingly cool.  I run this TSoY Aztec-themed game occasionally, and there's one guy, Lord Bird, who gets picked last invariably, and he really is the most fun character to play, and very important to the game.

Players get a handout with short blurbs about each of the available characters, then rank order those characters.  The blurb includes some information about ways the characters' skills and abilities can be used in the adventure--sort of like 'roles and responsibilities' information.  Once all the players' choices are tabulated, characters are assigned based on maximizing 'satisfaction'.  <br><br>Another method I've used is to have interested players roll for each character, with the higher roll winning, but the players have the option of using in-game resources to modify the dice.  In Spirit of the Century, for example, players would roll the four FUDGE dice but could then spend Fate Points for a re-roll or +2 to the result.  <br><br>Mel                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Carl" title="Carl"><img alt="Carl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Carl">Carl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151128/#Comment_151128" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-16T22:48:36+00:00" title="June 16, 2008 10:48PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like Matthijs' approach very much, I may try that myself someday.<br/><br/>Usually I prefer characters created together by players at the game (<em>Ditv</em>, <em>DRYH</em>), but I've also done:<br/><br/>With <em>Monsters and Other Childish Things</em> I read a bit about each character and their monster, and then let the players decide. With six players I have 3 players play monsters, 3 their kids.  I was worried there might be a deadlock, but it wasn't a problem.  I also have 6 kid/monster pairs so no one gets stuck with last choice.<br/><br/>In <em>The Mountain Witch</em> I put the six ronin at the six seats and people played whoever they sat down at.  Your enemy was directly across from you and your allies two seats to either side, so that was easy to remember.<br/><br/>In <em>Bliss Stage</em> Final Act or back when I ran Junkyard Cops in <em>Feng Shui</em> I read the signature quote for each character and then let players select in order of arrival at the table, so that people who showed up first get first pick.<br/><br/>Back when I ran <em>Champions</em> I did notice that leader PCs often got picked by players who were LEAST suited to playing leaders, which at least once led to a coping strategy among the other players that their smart leader had been replaced by a robot and to work around him.<br/><br/>Someday I'd like to do a time travel scenario where multiple people can pick the same character and its no problem, but that would be troublesome to prep since I'd have to bring multiple copies of each character.  My original idea for that was a two-part tournament in which part one would end with one hero chosen to travel back in time, and the part two would start with those characters arriving from their respective timelines, possibly some of them duplicated.  My dislike for tournament format advancement meant I never got around to attempting that, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151180/#Comment_151180" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-17T09:36:24+00:00" title="June 17, 2008  9:36AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dumb idea:  Give them a little binary sorting test before game starts, sorta like they did on some old Ultima game that I played which set your class.<br/><br/>Or just don't worry about it and hand them out randomly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151185/#Comment_151185" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-17T10:08:50+00:00" title="June 17, 2008 10:08AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I distributed my Dictionary of Mu characters based on their kickers, yeah, and it worked out really well.<br/><br/>I was play a game with Thor and he mentioned how for one pre-gen game he ran, there was an elf who was actually the conscience of the group and he distributed him by saying, "Who wants to play an elf," and the player, wanting to play Legolas from the LotR movies, took the character thinking he would knife orcs in the eye and shield surf his way through the adventure, which he attempted to do, ignoring any Beliefs on his character sheet.<br/><br/>We talked about it and how he could have handed out the character saying, "This is the conscience of the party," instead.<br/><br/>Thinking very specifically about what I say and how I present the characters is really important.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151659/#Comment_151659" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-19T10:23:08+00:00" title="June 19, 2008 10:23AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tangential to the original topic - I avoid con games where PCs are in a formal chain of command (Star Trek, Stargate, Twilight 2000) 'cuz most roleplayers I run into have no idea how to give or follow orders or what it means to NOT follow orders.

Mostly I went random; it was the most likely method to avoid problems - this was a hard-learned lesson from years of convention experience. But if I usually had two female characters out of each table of six characters and if I had female players I'd ask if they wanted the female characters first (with little to no information about them). <br><br>In most of my events, the characters had secrets, so there was no possibility of switching after the start or passing them around. But even when they didn't have secrets, I'd still go random to avoid the "I was really hoping to play a wizard" crap. My games were about characters, not classes, and it was hard enough getting people to actually <i>read</i> anything on their character sheets other than the stats.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vae_editor" title="vae_editor"><img alt="vae_editor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vae_editor">vae_editor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153449/#Comment_153449" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-27T18:26:53+00:00" title="June 27, 2008  6:26PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I'm using pre-gen characters and I don't know the players I don't let them browse through the options.<br/><br/>Either I asked them some basic questions: "Would you rather player a thinker or a doer?", "Are you familiar with military tactics?", "Are there certain types of crime that upset you?" and then make a judgement call on who gets what.<br/><br/>If that's not an option I shuffle the characters and hand them out randomly.
