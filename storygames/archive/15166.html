In almost no time at all, three of us have perished fighting some dread talking-snake-with-a-horn-guardian-thing.  Darla, the noble of our party, and the sole possessor of an actual sword, criticals it and takes out one of its two eyes.  Two more PCs die to snake bite.  We only need 13s but we can't seem to hit the thing for shit and every time it strikes, someone goes down for good.  The party is spread out and only a couple of us can get to it at a time.  Tense!<br/><br/>My vagrant Rory, steps up and looks at his childhood friends on the floor of the crypt.  He's got a Personality (Wisdom/Charisma combo stat) of 18 (the only 18 in the whole party) and I'm hoping to graduate him to Cleric if he makes it to 1st level.  Rory brandishes his club and looks the thing dead in its one good eye.  "I'm giving him the Rasputin snake-charmer stare," I say. "Eye contact is critical.  I want him to remember me."  Totally steely, Rory says, "THIS... is what you get when you tangle with those from Millhaven!!!"  Roll.  20.  High fives galore!  Critical table gives extra damage and happens to be the exact same crit that Darla rolled earlier.  BOOM!  Eye-shot, mofo!!! <br/><br/>Blind and badly hurt, the snake thing tries to flee but the guild beggar takes it down.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345199/#Comment_345199" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-07T10:07:24+00:00" title="October  7, 2011 10:07AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stars Without Number: Two nobles and a merchant turned space marine from Ephesus come back to their home world to find it hotly contested by rebel forces.

The knife-edge of the game makes me giddy sometimes.<br/><br/>Here's two from last session:<br/>1) The PCs, currently some of the most wanted people in the solar system with multiple high-value bounties on their heads, decide to hide out -- by going to a secret space-dock frequented by the most dangerous criminals in the system. Um. Okay.<br/><br/>I ask for a Culture/Criminal test as a Reaction roll to see what kind of relationship they have with Santiago Huertas, the fixer who runs the place. Can they count on any kind of friendly reception or protection while they're at dock? Hahahaha. I set the difficulty at 11.<br/><br/><i>Dylan rolls double sixes.</i> The players are like, "Ok, cool. Let's talk to Santiago," as if they didn't just roll to see if they got massacred by bounty hunters or not. Jebus.<br/><br/>2) Later, they decided to try to make some extra cash by taking a cargo job before leaving Jupiter. They asked around and found out that extra patrol boats were on duty due to a "possible terrorist attack." They thought that maybe the extra patrols were really looking for them, but decided to risk the job anyway.<br/><br/>As they were getting their cargo, their ship got targeted by the <i>actual</i> terrorists who were trying to plant bombs on all the cargo traffic leaving the orbital station. I ask for a Security test from the PCs  to see what the difficulty for my terrorist's Stealth roll will be. A bad roll here means a bomb will be planted on their ship without them knowing. <i>They roll double sixes again.</i><br/><br/>Whew.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345237/#Comment_345237" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-07T14:45:13+00:00" title="October  7, 2011  2:45PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, our dice, not so much.

The restraints on narration and character behavior turned out to be really interesting-- the emotional swells and lulls dictated by the card-play ended up really evoking the extremely decompressed visual storytelling of female-targeted manga, because we had so many exchanges like this:<br/><br/>"Gonsalvo stares deeply into Honore's eyes and whispers 'I swear I will keep all your secrets safe, to the grave if I must; you are all I have in the world.'"

Robin Hood lets his arrows fly, as the wonderful marksman he is... and scores a double kill. <br/>Everybody is horrified: Super-heroes don't act that way. Lord Wickett defends him, proclaiming mole-people are not persons, and that a war must be waged. <br/>Dogfighter, the most outraged (apart from the silent Boadicea), ends up hiding the bodies, in order not to unsettle the nation: robin hood's punishment will come discreetly. <br/><br/>After that, the lord is escorted home. we venture in the under-reign, and speak to the Mole-king: war might come between Britain and underland, if things are not settled rapidly ... but we discover the Lord's estate, where we brought him , might have been booby-trapped. The Flying Scotsman snatches the lord from his bed to escort him to safety... and the Bomb is Triggered. Boadicea is hit, and remains unconcious in the burning building. Dogfighter arrives and flies in looking for her. he zaps in and out saving other people... but both of them are still in when the second charge bursts. the Scotsman, oblivious of his wounds, digs through the rummage all night, but doesn't even recover their bodies. <br/><br/>Light-heartedness and grim places. metric tons of pure flavourful setting. very simple d100 system, used in a pretty loose, narrative way (homebrew stuff). Fortune and Misortune kept on messing things up,and we never knew what to expect.

The first time was an accident, a fluke in an Augury gone awry. Then he started doing it on <i>purpose</i>.<br/><br/>Now folks are getting sick, vomiting up black bile, and those close to the Returned people most of all. Always begins to doubt whether raising them was right, after all. He brings Harridan to his Sister Burdick, the herbalist Savvyhead, for healing. Harridan's Returned brother, Brace, tags along, docile and vacant.<br/><br/>Burdick answers her door cautiously. Always' cult hates her for naysaying his Messages from the Gods, and the rift between them has grown to the verge of all-out opposition and turf war. But all who need healing are welcome in her house. As Harridan is laid down, Burdick tries to chat up Brace, whose responses are detatched and dull. Burdick focuses, and Opens Her Brain to see if there is anything of Brace there, within that shell.<br/><br/>Burdick's Open Brain Move has been advanced. I roll a 12. That means <i>she sees through the Psychic Maelstrom to what's beyond it.</i><br/><br/>So she looks into Brace, and sure enough, there's no Brace there. There's just a rotting blackness, a malignancy that threatens to spread to everything it touches. But she looks harder, and suddenly she can see the love, the pure shining threads of love that stretch between her, Always, and everyone else. Threads of love, yes, but also threads of pain and failure, the forces that mean things can't ever go right, the reason nothing thrives and joy is fleeting. Love and despair both, binding everyone together.<br/><br/>Burdick looks at Always, tears streaming, beatific. "Oh, Brother, I love you. I always have. There is so much love, all around us." Always nods. "I love you so much," she continues, "and it's all right. I'm going to help you."<br/><br/>And she turns, draws her long knife and serenely cuts off Brace's head, in one graceful whirlwind motion. The body crumbles to dust.<br/><br/>Always flees into the woods, shaken to the core, contemplating whether to stop being a Hocus for good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345918/#Comment_345918" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-13T23:50:19+00:00" title="October 13, 2011 11:50PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 13, 2011 11:51PM by Wilhelm.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yesterday the Play In English group met to play again.

That way the reveals in act two will be all the more horrifying.<br/><br/>* Replace a few of the things in the black circle with positive emotions, maybe "desire" and "tenderness". That way we will still have a death spiral of doom in act two, but there will be some light to set it all in context. We found that there was so much darkness that the nuances got lost. (Now that I think of it, I think that has been true for the previous games I've played in too. When it's all black and dark, there are no points of reference anymore.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346046/#Comment_346046" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-15T04:11:01+00:00" title="October 15, 2011  4:11AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2011/10/08/the-bechdel-test-a-roleplaying-poem/" rel="nofollow">Bechdel Test</a>: <br/><br/>Beru is out in the deserts of Tatooine when a young girl crashes her spaceship into a sand dune.

We played a short Nechronica scenario and had a enough time for me to show them Fiasco.<br/><br/><b>Nechronica</b>: In the dark, bleak future, the world is populated by unthinking undead.  3 little girls, their forms in varying stages of mutilation, woke up in a strange empty room. Marsh, the strange fish-like girl with tentacle legs, Jezami (a bastardized, feminine version of the name Jesus) awoke in a strange girl's body, claiming to be the daughter of a god. Lastly, Aegis, a girl with a drill grafted in place of an arm, found herself craving cake and calling for mommy. The three explored their surroundings and found themselves inside of a factory that created huge zombie abominations, put together with a line of unthinking undead. The three fought their way out and left the factory ready for another adventure together.<br/><br/><b>Fiasco</b>: Ken Masters and Ryu had a little trouble setting up the Street Fighting Summer Camp, what with the drunk, bleeding weirdos showing up on the camp grounds only weeks before the camp was to begin. John and Ken had a nice brotherly discussion in the attic of the lodge. Eventually, Ryu caught Ken's little brother John with a knife, so he tried to fight him and force him to tell him the truth about the killing. Ryu missed with a fireball and set the lodge on fire, while Ryu's love interest, Laura, was inside.  A mysterious man saved Laura while Ken tried to go in and save someone. In his steroid-induced fever, he thought he was fighting with a rival in the flames, but he was caught in the blaze and ran outside in flames, where John was waiting with a knife. Ken tried to hug John while John stabbed him, claiming that now he was the king of fighters. Ryu and Laura tried to get away in a car and hit John and a tree.  Laura ended up marrying Ryu, who was a mental wreck, but John got caught and went to jail forever. Ken was forgotten amongst the annals of street fighting history.<br/><br/>My thoughts: We played the introduction scenario for Nechronica, which was really just a short exploration followed by a simple fight. Nonetheless, there was a lot of role playing involved, much of it goofy. We learned the rules as we went along, and by the end of the game we had a pretty good grasp of them and we'd like to play more, but the other half of the group (that didn't show up) is not interested in playing. Fiasco was tough to get going. It got really chaotic and the group was sort of lost without a clear goal. I suggested that we try to set up the final scene early and work towards it, but that didn't work out so great. In case it wasn't obvious, we tried to run the Camp Death playset, but when I named my character Ken (a name that works for English and Japanese speakers), someone tagged him with the last name Masters and it was a big street fighter fest from there on out. We had fun, though I don't know if we'll be playing it again in that group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346240/#Comment_346240" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-16T14:52:25+00:00" title="October 16, 2011  2:52PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Playing Shock with strangers, because that's how we roll on Thursday night:<br/><br/><b><a href="http://www.storygamesseattle.com/messages/boards/thread/16880282" rel="nofollow">"It's a Greek Tragedy!"</a></b><br/><br/>Fantastic game.

The crew found themselves far off course and seemingly betrayed by Dr. Rose Pendragon.  Brutal combat, malfunctioning systems, and the betrayer betrayed all came in to play, it did not end well for Rose.  My character heroically ended up getting a lethal dose of radiation.  :-P<br/><a href="http://sundayskypers.podbean.com/2011/10/26/monkeycon-trouble-with-rose/" rel="nofollow">http://sundayskypers.podbean.com/2011/10/26/monkeycon-trouble-with-rose/</a><br/> <br/>02 Afternoon - A crazy little <i>Zorcerer of  Zo</i> session with some classic old school D&amp;D tropes.  Of course, I knew the mace was cursed, not that my character did.  [insert sounds of Rogan Ratnardski getting the stuffing beat out of him.]   Nothing that a little mince meat pie can't cure.  :-)<br/> <br/>03 Evening - First time playing <i>Lady Blackbird</i> and I went with Naomi Bishop. OMGWTFBBQ! I had a manically good time causing mayhem and getting vengeance.  I tried hard to be the match maker as well, but the two in love were dense as lug nuts.<br/><br/>04 Night - <i>GIANT MONSTER ROBOTS: A Musical Extravaganza On Ice!</i> was a totally mad cap mix of Wushu and... inspired singing.  Mangled lyrics, mangled aliens, giant robot monsters saved Science City X and smashed the alien mothership into an active volcano for a finale!  :-D<br/><br/>05 Unofficial after con game - Punch drunk and not ready to quit, some of us conspired to play one more game for MonkeyCon Zero, we went with <i>Fiasco</i> using the <i>Hocus Focus</i> playset.  Another first for me, Fiasco totally brought a wonderfully weird and crazy vibe.  My character, John Smith was simultaneous a Red Court vampire thrall and vassal to a Sidhe Lady.  Used as a deadly, abused, crazed, and devoted pawn, John was used in a power game between two supernatural creatures.  Toss in a creepy taxidermist and a disgruntled employee to add a little mortal chaos.  Harry Dresden was a force of nature causing fire and panic... over an order of decapitated stuffed squirrels?  Wizards...  John suffered throughout the whole game but was the only one to come out with a happy ending.<br/><br/>All of these will eventually be hosted on or linked at the <a href="http://sundayskypers.podbean.com/" rel="nofollow">Sunday Skypers</a> actual play podcast site.<br/>--<br/>TAZ                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346906/#Comment_346906" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-25T11:48:42+00:00" title="October 25, 2011 11:48AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We finished our Apocalypse World In Orbit game, with a voyage down to earth to fix the psychic maelstrom: Trench, our savvyhead had determined with a big enough antennae at ground zero and a human host he could suck it all up and contain it - and he did, using himself as the host. <br/>Paralyzed by the energies flowing through him, he had a vision where he was in what I suppose must have been the collective unconscious of the maelstrom, meeting some sort of masked king - the king handed his staff and necklace to Trench - it was pretty clear what was going on. <i>You take over.

I had a partially written beta draft that I failed to get ready for PAX, but the game is written for 8 players and it wasn't really feasible to find that many available folks with not a lot of warning.  So we sat down in the crowded and noisy "gamer bar" next to Card Kingdom and I warned everybody else about the state of the game, only having 5 players, and the fact that the noise was going to make it hard for the game to feel intimate and impactful.<br/><br/>But I was totally wrong.  The game was amazing, the characters were vivid and strange, and everything worked more or less like it was supposed to.  Transantiago is essentially an experiment at surrealism and mythological imagery, with the structure of the game barely helping it hang together, so describing what happened is somewhat difficult.  Tori played The Assassin, the murderer of the world, who carried a book of names and marked people whose names lit up as she passed them.  During one part, The Kitemaker and The Navigator had lost sight of each other within a subway station (Los Leones) erupting in spouts of water; The Kitemaker cast out her strings like a net; the Navigator caught one and used it to pull them both down into the watery floor of the station, where they emerged through the blowhole of a whale to find The Virgin holding the other end of the string; The Virgin then called forth The Blacksmith from a choir of people singing inside the whale, and, while The Blacksmith, Kitemaker, and Navigator were spit up towards the surface, The Virgin descended deeper into the waters with the remnants of the choir, left behind to perish with the world.<br/><br/>There were a few places where the current guidelines didn't quite carry the players through some moments of confusion.  Without me there to talk people through it, there might have been more problems, but there's definitely some built-in problem-solving potential in the game, where the players can invent specific fictional/mechanical solutions to issues they encounter.<br/><br/>All in all, though: super exciting and invigorating.  I can't wait to finish the beta draft and share it with others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347237/#Comment_347237" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-29T12:08:38+00:00" title="October 29, 2011 12:08PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 29, 2011 8:41PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My friends Eric, Colin, Morgan Jesse and I finally had our first session of playing in the setting of Glorantha last week. (We're using <i>Hero Wars</i>, with some bits of <i>HeroQuest 2</i> hacked in.)<br/><br/>But, since I count making stuff up with friends even before we start rolling dice part of play, our actual play has been going on for weeks.<br/><br/>First we gathered up and had a session just talking about Glorantha and the tone and feel of the game. I haven't played a setting heavy environment for a gazillion years, and I wanted to take advantage of the rich culture and situation available in Dragon Pass and Glorantha. So I made lots of handouts about Heortling culture, the pantheon of the Storm Gods and so on.<br/><br/>Next we did the <a href="http://www.glorantha.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/ISS2002c-small.pdf" rel="nofollow">Clan Generation Questionnaire</a> from SARTAR: KINGDOM OF HEROES. This walks the Players through their Clan's history from the beginning of time to their current situation in Dragon Pass. It took the whole night, but helped, I think, nail down the sense of scope and mythology of setting. <br/><br/>They answered questions like this:<br/><br/><b>1. The Council of Pairs.</b><br/><i>The Council of Pairs were eight Old Gods of the Celestial Court who embodied the great, opposing runic powers. They resided in the Cosmic<br/>Mountain at the center of the world and had equally contributed to the creation of Darhudan and Darhudana. However, each child of Grandfather<br/>and Grandmother Life favored one Old God over the others.<br/><br/>Which Old God did your clan ancestor favor?<br/>\u25a1 1. Acos, God of Stability<br/>\u25a1 2. Larnste, God of Movement<br/>\u25a1 3. Uleria, Goddess of Love<br/>\u25a1 4. Kargan Tor, God of Conflict<br/>\u25a1 5. Orenoar, Goddess of Truth<br/>\u25a1 6. Tylenea, Goddess of Illusion<br/>\u25a1 7. Harana Ilor, Goddess of Harmony<br/>\u25a1 8. Ratslaff, God of Disorder</i><br/><br/>As they answered the questions, their clan got checkmarks for different Values and Runes, so we could see what their clan was like; whether it was balanced more for War or Peace and so on.<br/><br/><br/>We got this result:<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CLAN RECORD SHEET</span></b><br/>Clan Name: White Owl\t<br/>Population: 1,200<br/>Tribe: Cinsina\t<br/><br/>Relation to Dragons: Hate &amp; Fear<br/>Relation to Lunars: Hostile to Lunars<br/><br/>Agriculture: Farming and Cattle\t<br/>Wealth: 18 (sources: raiding, plundering &amp; Tribute from other clans)<br/><br/><b>Elemental Runes:</b><br/>Storm/Earth Tribe Balance: 5 (air) / 1 (earth)<br/>Other Elemental Runes: 3 (Darkness)<br/>Power Runes:<br/>Favored Power Rune:  2  (movement)<br/>other Power Runes:  1  (disorder) <br/><br/><b>Resources:</b><br/>War 12W\tMoral 9W\tMagic 18\tWealth 18 \tPeace 12<br/> <br/><b>Clan Values</b><br/>\u2022 Ambitious 13: \u201cThe sleeping alynx does not catch the sheep, nor the slumbering man victory.

The Players created a constellation of stars over the land that forms a White Owl (hence the name of the clan).<br/><br/>We had to create the powers of the Wyter based on the events of the Clan's History, and got this:<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CLAN WYTER</span></b><br/><i>Manifestation:</i> Owl Constellation <br/><i>Communication</i>: Starlight<br/><i>Awareness</i> 5W2<br/><i>Defense</i> 5W2<br/><i>Blessing</i> 5W2<br/><br/><b>Special Abilities </b><br/>1. "We were given the Full Dish and Spoon by Asrelia, and from this learned that though we would have tools to eat, we would need to get our own food." Our Wyter has an Ability bound with Air and relating to this event.<br/><i>We can preserve food in times of war and violence</i><br/><br/>2. "We joined with Umath in his battle against the Bright Emperor. From this we gained our Clan Slogan: '<i>No one Can Make You Do Anything</i>.'\u201d Our Wyter has an Ability bound with Air and relating to this event.<br/><i>No clansman can be chained or imprisoned on our land</i><br/><br/>3. "After Umath was killed, our people joined Orlanth\u2019s army after he slew the Bright Emperor during Orlanth\u2019s Contests." Our Wyter has an Ability bound with Movement and relating to this event.<br/><i>We are wherever we need to be on our tulu in times of war or violence</i><br/><br/>4. "We were present when Ernalda first revealed the Tapestry of Destiny and the fate of the Gods. Our Wyter has an Ability bound with Earth and relating to this event."<br/><i>We are able to read the oracles of falling stars in matters of our clan\u2019s health and welfare and protection</i><br/><br/>5. "We survived the world when there was no love."<br/><i>Anyone from our clan married under the White Owl is blessed with a Happy Marriage 13</i><br/><br/>6. "Our foe from the forces of Chaos were the Dragons."<br/><i>Flaw: Giant Dragons can block the stars of the White Owl from us as they fly above.<br/>Ability: Early warning of an Dragon\u2019s evil intentions upon our clan</i><br/><br/>7. "We followed, Liorn the Young, a star who fell from the sky for the love of woman of our tribe and followed him to safety in the time of Darkness."<br/><i>We can summon a shooting star</i><br/><br/><br/>And then we made the Player Characters. And I want to share them with you, because my Players are awesome. Keep in mind that in the Hero Wars/HeroQuest system, you underline words in these 100-word descriptions, and these become Abilities in play. So phrases like "Humakt is calling," and "Driven to prove his loyalty," and "Courageous" and "Boisterous" all become Abilities with ratings on the Player Character sheets. The Player Characters are all from the same stead (essentially, a piece of land which clansman work together, usually bound by bloodlines), so the Characters are connected by family and community.<br/><br/><b>HARGAN</b><br/>Hargran is a Heortling Warrior Initiate of Orlanth Adventurous as Finovan the Raider. Happy husband of Sora and loving father to Jareen and Haloric. Was part of the stead Fyrd sent to Runegate, and the only one to return. At Boldhome Boltar the Talmori became his battle brother. He\u2019s a peerless swordsman whose sword is walking death in battle. His once great mirth has darkened since the war. He runs towards his foretold Wyrd to be the White Owl Clan Champion. Has told Domas the Deathforger about his troubling dreams of the dead who call out for justice. Humakt is calling.<br/><br/><b>JORAM</b><br/>Joram, son of Garnen, is a cunning Telmori foundling known as one of the best  hunters in the White Owl Clan. It is said his hand can turn stones into comets. He fights for his family name as his family fought for him. Joram seeks initiation into Orlanth's pantheon because he craves a sense of belonging. Broost, the Godi's son, claims Joram will fulfill the prophecy of the clansman who will betray his kin, but Joram is driven to prove his loyalty. He idolizes Nevana, for her adventurous spirit speaks to Orlanth's message: It is not who you were at birth, but who you are becoming.<br/><br/><b>NEVANA</b><br/>Nevana of the White Owl Clan, a young Heortling initiate to Ernalda the Queen and herder for her Uncle Ranulf. She's a rebellious daughter raised on stories by her father and dreams of being a warrior maiden. She's as forgiving as she is vengeful and too quick to fury. She is courageous, boisterous and no one can make her do anything, though she has been forbidden to join the fyrd despite being a better fighter than any boy. Captain Quintus trained her to fight when no one else would. She proudly wears the pelt of the wolf that almost killed her.<br/> <br/><b>VASTYR</b><br/>Vastyr, a heorterling skald, sings the tales of Orlanth, All Father and holds the records of the clan's history.  He recognized his beloved wife, Marlestra as the embodiment of one of his stories.  They have two daughters, the favored Lyzal and the rebellious Nevana who tries Vastyr's forgiving nature.  His friend Captain Quintas, shares tales of the Lunar Goddess but has begun to threaten Vastyr's traditional values by instigating a policy of imperial marriage. Vastyr's father and mentor, Hendrick was taken by Delecti the Necromancer.  Vastyr has sworn to avenge his father by learning the end of his story and singing it upon the lute he left behind.<br/><br/><br/>Then I went off and made up Bangs - making sure that every Bang hit two or more Characters at a time to help draw them together and ties their fates together.<br/><br/>That's all before play started. But I love al the detail, history, and sense of community that has been created so far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347259/#Comment_347259" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-29T15:38:27+00:00" title="October 29, 2011  3:38PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Monster of the Week, minicon scenario. <br/><br/>A hunter captured the big bad, in spirit form, by making the inside of the car a spirit cage and then driving through the big evil ritual, capturing the spirit and driving off. <br/><br/>Then came the problem of what happens when you are driving a car and your passenger is an ancient death god, very angry as you just messed up its ritual to regain a physical body. <br/><br/>It did not end well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347550/#Comment_347550" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-01T11:09:18+00:00" title="November  1, 2011 11:09AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Witness the Murder of Your Father and Be Ashamed, Young Prince - <br/>5 people, none of us having read the rules before, read it aloud before play.<br/><br/>The Youngest Prince<br/>The Most Cheerful Prince<br/>The (Most Forgettable, apparently, as I don't recall at the moment) Prince<br/>The Sexiest Prince<br/>The Eldest Prince<br/><br/>The King, after having made some arrangement with Crow, was having a Storyteller during the feast.  Winter had just been banished from the land, and no one really knew why, or at what cost.<br/><br/>The Youngest suggested that poisons had been used because the King was grotesquely bloated and disgusting, but the Eldest informed him to speak respectfully, and that their father's body looked asleep, but otherwise untouched.  Most of the evening was spent with Princes covering for themselves, inventing fanciful excuses as to why they were no where near the murder, or how they could not have done it at all.<br/><br/>Storytellers are apparently agents of Crow, and since only the Princes assembled here have the blood in their veins to summon such... demons... it had to have been one among us.<br/><br/>Two rounds of stories, from the cautiously self-deprecating pleas of innocence, to the garrulously hoary tales of sexual conquest.  The Youngest insisted we had no time left for petty squabbles, and we went unanimously to a decision.<br/>The Sexiest and The Eldest were in equal favor, with only the Youngest holding a [red] stone.<br/><br/>The Sexiest insisted that he cared nothing for the kingdom itself, and would simply follow the whims of the advisors as a playboy and puppet.<br/>The Eldest chastised him for caring so little, hoping that a good king knew when to keep a kingdom's secrets. (It had been famously established that the Eldest witnessed the entire events of the evening, but from a distance.)<br/><br/>The Youngest sided with the honesty of the playboy, and the Eldest (as well as the other two) were sent into exile.<br/><br/>All was just as well, since the Eldest was Ravensworn in the end.<br/><br/>I recorded an AP, but haven't translated it to text yet.  I really liked the game a lot and would play again.  The timing element added fuel to the stories.  "Why are you stalling, brother... would you have us forget the oath to Crow that looms overhead and threatens to tear us apart?"<br/>The stones took some getting used to, and we all wanted some more of them.  Perhaps the velocity of the stones is the only thing.  Better to keep them moving.<br/>And we spent time on things other than the big three (how did the King die, who did it, and who is the next heir).  We still concluded with 13 seconds to spare, but we could have done SO MUCH MORE.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347554/#Comment_347554" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-01T11:17:06+00:00" title="November  1, 2011 11:17AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Also over the weekend]<br/><br/>Sea Dracula! - <br/>6 people, none of whom had played before, two had read the game<br/><br/>Underground Magic Carpet Racing was the nature of the crime.<br/><br/>The investigation began at Mr. Lu's noodle shop, where a Not-So-Fiery Crash had taken place!<br/>Among the clues were<br/>-A toothpick statue of the Venus di Milo<br/>-60,000 thread count carpet fragments<br/>-A 4-door magic carpet with the serial numbers filed off<br/>-The contents of a glove compartment<br/>-Said glove compartment<br/>-A lion's mane wig<br/>-A sequined tuxedo<br/><br/>We had lots of ridiculous moments and dancing!
