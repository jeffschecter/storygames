                    Hi!<br/>
  What game design components are required to fully enable Narrativist Play?<br/>
<br/>
  And to be clear, I am defining Narrativism as as a game in which narrative control is shared more equally among the players. Similar to PTA or ditv.<br/>
<br/>
  What makes the Narrative aspects of these games better? What game design features are absolutely necesary to Narrativist play?<br/>

                            Hi Vax<br/>
  Well, I don't have a lot of experience with this play style, so I couldn't answer it to save my life.<br/>
  But I guess questions like, is CR vital or not? Linear vs bell curve odds are better? Analog abilities vs preset abilities is more enabling? Rolling more often vs less often is preferred?<br/>
<br/>
  Anything in the design that is more effective.<br/>

                            Hi Josh<br/>
  Yeah, more or less. Hopefully not just what is required, but what is optimal. Structurally, speaking of course. I feel like there might be things outside the scope of rules and game structure that may enhance/harm this play style, but I prefer not to deal with that until I get a good handle on rules structure.<br/>

                            Alright, I think we've got a better idea of what we're talking about, then.  We're looking for mechanics which equally share narrative control between players.  There are, of course, many different approaches.<br/><br/>The first and easiest is to get rid of the GM.  This will immediately put all the players on an ostensibly equal level.  I say ostensibly because that won't really even the playing field between players until you also have...<br/><br/>Explicit means of expressing player desires both in terms of content (pirates are keen!) and in terms of significance (expressing my character's loyalty is important to my engagement).  This is often accomplished through discussion (Pitch session in PTA) or flags (Beliefs from BW, Keys from TSOY).  It's not enough that each player knows what they want -- the players need to know what the other players want.  This allows the players to engage with each other in ways that they'll appreciate, which in the end gives all players more influence and control over the narrative.<br/><br/>Also helpful is a linkage between player expectations and what happens in the fiction <em>beyond</em> the specific abilities of the player character.  That is, ways for the player to affect what's happening in the fiction that they can not accomplish through the in-character action.  This can be obvious and explicit ("I get to narrate what happens, now") or subtle and implicit ("I'm taking a Relationship with this guy" which translates into "This guy will be an important part of the story from now on.")<br/><br/>I find that a clear turn structure or other mechanic of "who talks when" helps out, here, because when it's "your turn" you then exert your own control over the narrative.  There are lots of players who <em>will not</em> contribute unless they are prompted to do so.  We're not all pushy control freaks.<br/><br/>Note that none of these are absolutely necessary (although the flags thing is very close), but they do all work together, and there are many different ways to make them work together.                        </div>

  OK, no GM. Makes sense, but how do you get conflict?<br/>
<br/>
  How do you encourage players to narrate conflict without them overdoing it?<br/>

                            Hi Din,<br/><br/>For Narrativist play you NEED:<br/><br/>1) The ability for everyone to make meaningful input<br/>2) On a meaningful topic<br/><br/>That's it.  <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> doesn't mean everyone has to input at the same time, or have the same input over everything.  <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> can be a topic that is preloaded by the game, created by the group before play, or spontaneously arise during play.<br/><br/>GM/No GM, what you need is input.  What makes the new breed of games better at supporting Nar play than the older generation, is that many of the older games support GM Fiat which robs the rest of the group of the chance for input.<br/><br/>The two major innovations we've seen that has opened the door for input, has been narration trading and explicit conflict resolution.  Narration trading prevents GM fiat and railroading.  Conflict resolution means that when the player sets stakes, and wins, it happens- again, no GM Fiat.  Good games to check out would be The Pool, Inspectres, Dust Devils and Donjon.<br/><br/>The other Nar based innovation which has assisted design and play has been Flags, or mechanics a player can use to let the rest of the group know what he or she wants the story to be about.  You can see this in Sorcerer's Kickers, PTA's Issues, Riddle of Steels' Spiritual Attributes, and Burning Wheel's BITs.  <br/><br/>Instead of keeping this simply theoretical, I highly, highly recommend playing some games in order to see how they generate conflict and how it works in play.  For instance, I bet Inspectres would be a good start...                        </div>

<p>Just a heads up, people ... this is very distinctly <strong>not</strong> a standard definition of Narrativism.  Paying attention to what D is saying will help us to make responses that answer his question about distributing authorship equitably among the players, rather than answering questions that he hasn't asked (about, for instance, Premise and address).</p>
<p>I don't actually have much in the way of recommendations.  Players are always going to be contributing <em>something</em> to the game.  The question of whether they have "narrative control" is in large part a question of what you decide that the narrative is about.</p>
<p>If you decide that the narrative is about the things the players did then they automatically have full narrative control.  Look, I've done RPG magic!  Or wankery.  The line can be so blurry some times.</p>

  Tony, c'mon... You have to have some ideas as to hat helps and what hurts. I think the idea of knowing what the story is about is good advice, what else you got?<br/>
  Serious, anyone else have some solid advice on what makes narration controls work.<br/>

<br/>
One simple way is to use some sort of token exchange system. Every time someone narrates something, they pay a token (perhaps to another player) to do it. <br/>
<br/>
That ensures everyone has equal-ish narrations rights. If the token gets given to another player, then, if one player narrates lots of stuff, they then give the other players more power to narrate.<br/>
<br/>
Capes does something like this (as Tony posting reminded me); Universalis does too, I think, it's been a long time since I read it; Adam Cerling's LARP system Ends and Means does this very directly.<br/>

<code><br/>OK, no GM. Makes sense, but how do you get conflict?<br/><br/>How do you encourage players to narrate conflict without them overdoing it?<br/><br/> I think the idea of knowing what the story is about is good advice, what else you got?<br/></code><br/><br/>Conflict comes from the players.  I define conflict (your definition may vary) as Character+Desire+Obstacle.  One player may supply all of that (my mage wants to get the tome that's under guard) or you can split the three up in interesting ways (hey, your mage?  Wouldn't he like this nice tome?  The one that Tony's character has?).  See Capes for a very good example of how everybody can throw in Conflicts.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what you mean by 'overdoing it'.  You mean providing so much adversity that the other players can't ever 'win'?  That can be solved by introducing an adversity budget, either explicit (spend points out of this pool) or obscured (you can increase the score on one side of a conflict once per turn).  Or did you mean something else.<br/><br/>A word about "the story" and knowing it from the start -- be careful here.  Be very careful.  Generally speaking, it's not a good idea to create the story beforehand -- otherwise, why play?  What is a good idea is to collaborate on a rough direction and maybe the starting situation.  The "story" is usually something that comes out as a result of the players interacting with the situation along that rough direction.<br/><br/>And as Chris mentioned, if you haven't played any of these games, it would be a very good idea to try a couple of them out.  I hear the IRC channel has a habit of doing pickup games; that's an awesome opportunity to broaden your understanding.                        </div>

                            Hi!<br/>
  Yeah, I been working on that, so far no games have started and of course, I don't feel confident enough to start my own, lol<br/>

                            Can we avoid terminology drift? <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/_articles/narr_essay.html" rel="nofollow">Narrativism is well-defined</a>. You're talking about the sharing of responsibilities, which is a matter of technique, not Agenda.<br/>
<br/>
Once we see that you're looking for techniques, the next question is easy: what are the responsibilities that must be addressed in a Story Game?<br/>
<br/>
I'm fond, apparently, of listing these:<br/>
<br/>
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Create fit opposition.<br/>
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Play protagonists.<br/>
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Play background characters.<br/>
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Make up color.<br/>
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Show approval.<br/>
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Arbitrate real-world disputes.<br/>
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Arbitrate the outcome of fictional events.<br/>
<br/>
There might be more that I'm glossing over or whatever. Line these up in such a way that you don't have conflicts of interest in any player, and you've got something to work with.                        </div>
