The FRPG Fabula is one classical game I have designed. "Livets H\xf8st" is a modern game I have designed. I'va had players telling me both these games have changed their lives. Currently my greatest ambition is to design games that connects to players in a deeply personal way, both in my classical and modern design-endeavours. I purpose to reach that ambition by utilizing all that I have learned about game-design, all the tricks and tools of my trade, and I continuously strive to sharpen my tools.<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TOUCH</span></b><br/>One tool I have used a bit is <i>touch</i>. By <i>positive </i>touch; a handshake or a hug, or joining arms in a ring, we activate centers in the brain that regulates feelings of safety and happiness. I have used this to make players feel sympathetic towards eachother, and to make players feel sympathetic towards a NPC.<br/><br/>Negative touch does the opposite, I know, but I have not tried it (in games, that is). I believe it may be used to good effect though, in a restricted and careful way. It is conceivable that by placing a fist on the shoulder of a fellow player, he/she may feel threatened. Without being actually violated, the player will respond instinctively, by sweating and feeling uncomfortable. He/she will want the fist removed as fast as possible. That is an effect that may be useful in some games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20Arntson" title="Zak Arntson"><img alt="Zak Arntson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/147/nVMQWQSYECWCV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20Arntson">Zak Arntson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149309/#Comment_149309" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T11:16:43+00:00" title="June 10, 2008 11:16AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2008 1:27AM by Zak Arntson.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Are you a game designer?</b> Yes, in the capacity that I write and release original games, mostly for free.<br/><b>What games have you designed?</b> <a href="http://www.harlekin-maus.com" rel="nofollow">Harlekin-Maus</a> should have a list of all my games.

This had to be, but I also wanted the players to keep on playing. The solution was to make them play what other characters <i>remember </i>of their own character. A dead character is brought to life in the game through comments on "what you and me experienced back then" or "what I did once" or "how we quarreled once" or "all of you remembers how I used to fidget in situations like this" or other reminiscing comments.<br/><br/>The game itself is mostly on the past of the old (and dead) characters, building a fable on their lives and friendships. The memorial-PCs works as a very effective and meaningful tool in this game. Nearly all the game-scenes are framed as the funerals of the PC's, so the memorial-PCs fits like hand in glove with the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_149812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149812/#Comment_149812" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T15:37:14+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  3:37PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2008 4:00PM by TomasHVM.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>ENCOUNTER-CASCADE</b></span><br/><br/>I made a combat/war-module for my classical FRPG Fabula some years ago. The module introduced a very effective tool for simulating the chaos of a battlefield; the encounter-cascade.<br/><br/>It is fairly simple: you make up a long list of <i>simple and threatening situations</i> arising in the <b>beginning </b>of the battle, in the <b>midst </b>of it, and in the <b>final throes</b> of it. Make each situation-description not more than a single line, but make one or two sides of typewritten pages of them (a LOT of situations). Follow the list from start to end, to play out the battle.<br/><br/><b>Example situations:</b><br/><i>A man comes towards you, SCREAMING, his wooden axe over his head! (peasant, Combat 8+3 Axe, no armor)<br/>Something MOVES in the doorway behind you! (small angry boy, Combat 5+1 knife, no armor)<br/>Two men in red coats close in on you, they are fearsome! (your own bloodied knights, Combat 20+6 sword, +1/-7 shield, scale mail -2/+7)<br/>A woman attacks you, kitchen knife in one lame hand (bleeding, crying, desperate, no combat, no armor)<br/>etc.</i><br/><br/>When the characters get into the battle, you switch from normal play to this list. You start going around the table at high speed, throwing encounters at one or more players all the time. They must respond at once, or be dumbfounded, or stricken by enemies. They are in "battle-mode", and must make split-second decisions regarding life and death of any man/woman coming at them from the shadow/smoke/chaos of the field. They may choose to utilize some weapon. If so you let let them make a simple skill-check, gives them the brutal consequence, and goes on. On and on and on you goes! It will feel like an eternity for the players, and the sheer amount of fatal decisions they must make, will wear them out. In this instance tired players are a very good thing. It will help them step into the shoes of a real soldier.<br/><br/>The GM goes on like a crazy clockwork of doom, until the battle ends and the characters are running for their lives, or taking control over the battlefield. Then you go into normal modus again, and try to give the players pause to evaluate what the battle did to their characters (injuries are noted, shock declared, fatal misjudgement taken into consideration, both mental and physical fatigue make their bodies shake, moral mechanisms activates, etc.).<br/><br/>Most players feel like they've been in some hell when this tool is used, and have an easy job in simulating the traumatic after-effects of the battle through their characters. It is a radical tool, for radical situations, and it makes an impact.<br/>_____________________________________<br/><br/><b>A VARIATION</b><br/>As a variation, you may build out your list in the midst of the battle, by asking the players "What do you see"? they must answer this as fast as any thing you throw at them, and you will make their description into an encounter at once. You do not slack on the rythm to do this, but goes on like before.<br/><br/>This can only be done when the players are warming to the speed of encouters, to ensure they are on their toes and ready to answer anything you throws at them immediately. Then most players have no problem describing some brutality or tragedy or threat on the battlefield, and you will be pumped up to take it directly into play, and resolve it as fast as anyting premade on your list.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_150310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150310/#Comment_150310" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T22:40:24+00:00" title="June 12, 2008 10:40PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2008 10:42PM by TomasHVM.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>FABLE-TALK</b></span><br/><br/>In my game <i><b>Muu </b></i>(classical RPG, poetic fable, 1989) both setting and character-identification were reinforced by the use of a special, poetic way of describing everything. By using a simple structure focused on the natural elements of the setting, the poetic descriptions managed to weave a fable of harmony and bewildering wonder which both gave the setting depth, and forced the players to look at the world through the eyes of their <i>muu</i>.<br/><br/>The simple language-structures of the game empowered the "muuleader" (GM) to use this "fable-talk" effectively, supporting the <i>muu'ishness</i> of the game. As the muus are beings with no language themselves, the control exercised by the game over the descriptive language used, are supportive of their alternative way of thinking and looking at all elements in the setting. The game is deeply immersive, to the point where it may be described as an "interactive harmony-motor" (really; the game plays much like a meditation). The <i>fable-talk</i> is at the hearth of this game-experience.<br/><br/><b>Examples:</b> there is <i>muu </i>(the character, nameless), and <i>allmuu </i>(all characters together, the total population of muu) and <i>bigmuu </i>(a pole dirven into the ground, with a stick fastened abeam). There is also <i>Great Warm Muu </i>(the sun) and <i>Cold Muu</i> (the moon). To follow up this the elements of the natural setting is described in the same way: <i>tree</i>, <i>alltree </i>(forest), <i>bigtree </i>(the great tree allmuu is living under), <i>water</i>, <i>allwater </i>(the heavens), <i>prickly waters</i> (a brook), etc.<br/><br/>The game was written purely on intuition, in one single night. I've never written anything like it before or since, and have seen no RPG-tool remotely similar to the "fable-talk".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_150649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150649/#Comment_150649" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T17:30:33+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  5:30PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2008 5:37PM by TomasHVM.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "The tools for change" is the title of this thread. So I am trying to post tools of my own, that I perceive to be effective instruments for influencing people on a deep personal level. The changes purported by these tools are not always immediate, and most of them are subtle (as in: this challenges me, I must think about it ... and maybe it will make me slightly wiser, or openminded, or tolerant, or slightly calmer).<br/><br/>Here's another tool in the series:<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>THE MUUSONG</b></span><br/>As previously stated I made the roleplaying game <i>Muu </i>back in 1989, a poetic fable with meditative qualities. Muu is a being with no language. They communicate on an empathic level (<i>allmuu </i>will feel what every single <i>muu </i>is feeling), and by shared dreams. However; the muu has a voice, and may sing.<br/><br/>The song is a very strong myth in<i> Muus World</i>. To sing demands thorough preparations by the muu, and the right conditions. If the conditions are there (moonlight, singingwater, nightingale ...), the player may choose to have his/her muu sing. If this option is chosen, the muuleader immediately asks the player to stand up, turn around, go to the corner of the room, turn, and walk up to the table again. <i><b>As you come back to the table</b></i>, the muuleader tells the player; <i><b>you will immediately sing a muusong. The muusong is kind of a hum/troll-song. Not a big song with words, but a small song with sounds. Very small and strange and easy. Do not think. Go do it right now.</b></i><br/><br/>This ritual has, without exception, made for the most marvellous muusongs. Most people are not very used to singing, so they perform with nervous, highpitched voices and clumsy rhythm, and that is spot on for the muu. After all; muu is a figure which seldom use its voice. So the fragile and clumsy song of the player mimic the muusong perfectly.<br/><br/>The fragile songs made by muuplayers, are among the most beautiful and rewarding experiences ever given me in a roleplaying game. And the best thing about it, is the unanimous praise for the singing each and every singer gets from his/her fellow players. It is touching to the point of tears.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_150652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150652/#Comment_150652" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T17:41:23+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  5:41PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you want to contribute, please do so.

And she may change the relationships due to the events of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_150758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150758/#Comment_150758" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-14T11:57:02+00:00" title="June 14, 2008 11:57AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2008 11:59AM by TomasHVM.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            oh                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dan%20White" title="Dan White"><img alt="Dan White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dan%20White">Dan White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150885/#Comment_150885" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-15T11:40:42+00:00" title="June 15, 2008 11:40AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2008 11:46AM by Dan White.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joey - "You went over the line.

You will give any player inviting to such interaction an "experience point" at the end of session.<br/><br/>The XP can be used by the player in later sessions, to make some connection between his character and a person/place/phenomenon. This connection will always relate to the past of the character, and may be helpful (or harmful) in any way.<br/><br/>When you have given a player XP, you may rule that the next XP will be given for 2 emotional interactions, then for 3, etc. Maybe you will see, eventually, that the players do this for themselves, without the XP as motivation. It may change the way they play the game. By exploring themes like these, the players may actually get some new insights on friendship ...<br/><br/><i>BTW: I am aware of the parallel between XP in this sense, and XP in classical RPGs.

Make statements like: "You know I love you" and "As your father it is my duty to tell you ..." and "We are family, so I will stand by you".<br/><br/>Follow up such statements with advice and actions which are contrary to the PCs goals, or which may threaten them. The NPC may expect the PC to stay longer than possible; "I am so glad you have come! You must celebrate midsummer with us! Or course you will! It will be soo nice"!<br/><br/>To do this is fairly normal among people, and it works (in games too). Lost sons coming home will often be met with statements which hook on to their consciousness (the bad one), and will regularly be expected to stay for ever.<br/><br/>For players strident enough to make resistance to the fact that their PC has family-ties, you may use shame and social pressure to reign them in. For people to break with their family is fairly common, but not easy. Don't make it easy for the PCs either. The player should feel that the PC is risking something of great importance if he breaks with his family (or friends, lovers, partners).<br/><br/>This slightly dysfunctional family-communication may be used to hook on to the PCs, making them vulnerable in new ways. Vulnerable PCs are only possible if the players themselves are vulnerable, so such interaction must be played out with gusto and realism, directed at the player. Make the player relate to the NPC, and the field is set for exploring family-ties and conflicts on a deeper level than normal in RPGs.<br/><br/>Such exploration is a field for rich and rewarding gameplay, as it takes place in a sphere of life all of us relate to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
