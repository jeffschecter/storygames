Towards the end of WWII, the Japanese built the two largest battleships (with the largest gun turrets) ever made: the Yamato, and her sister, the Musashi. But as the war progressed, it became apparent that the war wasn't going to be decided on the sea, but rather in the air. And it also became apparent that the United States was likely to win.<br/><br/>So on April 1st, 1945, the Japanese--in a show of pride and desperation--sent the Yamato on a daring suicide mission. The Yamato was to make a full frontal assault on the American navy positioned off the coast of Okinawa. The Yamato was to beach iself on the coast, effectively turning itself into an unsinkable gun turret.<br/><br/>But six days into its mission, while it was still over 200 miles from its destination, the Yamato was sunk by US aircraft. The Yamato was sacrificed, with nothing gained.<br/>_________<br/><br/>For some reason I find this story very compelling. Awhile ago I got the idea to turn this into a game.<br/><br/>In the year 2345, the global government of Earth is at war with the United Galactic Colonies (or maybe some alien race, whatever). The government of Earth is losing, so it launches its one last hope of victory: the cosmic battleship Yamato, the largest cosmic battleship ever made. The plan is for the Yamato to enter enemy space and fire its uber-weapon, destroying the enemy homeworld (or whatever). But the trip through enemey territory won't be easy...<br/><br/>The players would play the officers of the escort ships sent to protect the Yamato. I decided to steal Andy's idea behind his game <a href="http://zigguratbuilder.livejournal.com/14200.html" rel="nofollow">Tactica</a>. The game will involve two kinds of scenes: Dramatic scenes and battle scenes. The drama scenes would involve your standard role-playing fare. The battle scenes, though, would involve full-on mini boardgame action. I'm not sure how Andy wanted his game to work, but mine would work like this: The drama scenes would fuel the battle scenes, and the battle scenes the drama scenes. But there's a twist...<br/><br/>In the drama scenes, various elements (like relationships, etc.) would be put at risk in order to fuel the battle scenes, via "action points". In the battle scenes, players would use the action points to do cool stuff to fend off enemy craft. But during the battle scenes, players would not only control their own ships, but would also share control of enemy craft (the game would be GM-less).<br/><br/>So here's the deal, you would receive "drama points" for <i>inflicting damage as an enemy craft</i>. Drama points would be used to further the drama elements, further the Yamato's mission, or possibly heal damage in general. And here's the twist with damage---the player who receives damage gets to decide how it's applied---towards his ship, his drama stuff, or the Yamato itself.<br/><br/>Are you seeing where this is going? People are always going to receive damage, but they get to decide how its applied, and how healing points are spents. What gets sacrificed and what gets spared?<br/><br/>The game would end when: 1) All the players are killed, 2) the Yamato is destroyed, or 3) the Yamato fulfills its mission (aka you rack up a certain number of points).<br/>_______________<br/><br/>What do y'all think about the idea?<br/>Help me think up some rules!<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>PS---I know there's an anime called <i>Space Battle ship Yamato</i>, there's no relation other than the influence of the real life ship.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A" title="Albert A"><img alt="Albert A" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://web.mac.com/albertwa/Ryoanji.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A">Albert A</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97225/#Comment_97225" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T12:51:15+00:00" title="September 18, 2007 12:51PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have time to brainstorm now, but I think that a really good story-game/minis-wargame hybrid would be <i>freakin' awesome</i>.<br/><br/>Also, the Yamato is pretty cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RoninZombie" title="RoninZombie"><img alt="RoninZombie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RoninZombie">RoninZombie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97253/#Comment_97253" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T13:43:32+00:00" title="September 18, 2007  1:43PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2007 1:44PM by RoninZombie.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tim, I seriously dig your ideas so far.<br/><br/>I think you need a strong mechanism for building interesting, unique threats for each battle scene.

I thought one possibility might be to have some formula (based on the drama scenes?) that would grant a certain number of points, upon which the battle scenes were constructed by the players (number of ships, power of ships, terrain, etc.)<br/><br/>A "wave" of enemies certainly <i>sounds </i>cool...\n<blockquote>I'd also like to see tensions that build in drama scenes come to a head in battle scenes...Capt Ashley and Capt Shima are having an affair.

Like, the tension with Capt Shima would be introduced in the drama scene. Then, in the battle, the player of Capt Ashley is forced to take a hit. He has to decide if it'll damage his relationship with Capt Shima, the Yamato, or if he'll take it himself.

Does this sound like it might be an issue? I guess you could narrate around it, like, the hit to the player's ship was minor, but while he was occupied defending himself a missile slipped past him.

People who really want _just_ the cut-n-dried technical stuff are going to skip this game. This looks to be for folks who appreciate drama _and_ a little bit of table-top tactics.<br/><br/>So no, I don't think that there will be a huge amount of dissonance.<br/><br/>Also, while you mentioned that this isn't about Starblazers, I'd point out that there was a Starblazers minis game out for a while that (IMO) missed the whole point of the cartoon by being too technical and not dramatic enough.<br/><br/>To me, the joy of fantasy minis gaming ( whether orc'n'wizards, space whosimawhatitz, or semi-historical what-ifs?) is that you really do have a chance to make drama at least as relevant as technical side stuff, if not moreso.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98184/#Comment_98184" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-21T12:23:04+00:00" title="September 21, 2007 12:23PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shit, Tim's catching up to me...<br/>\n<br/>\n...gotta get working...<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98220/#Comment_98220" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-21T14:34:59+00:00" title="September 21, 2007  2:34PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Random game ideas:<br/><br/>--Drama points and damage points are cumulative for individual elements (drama stuff), respectively. Each element will have a maximum number of drama/damage points that it can take. If it reaches its maximum number of drama points first (that is, before damage is maxed out), then that element is "spared" or resolved (generally a happy outcome). If it maxes out on damage first, that element is destroyed (generally a negative outcome). I'm not sure if the maximums will be the same for all elements, or if some elements will be able to take more than others.<br/><br/>--The Yamato, similarly, will have a max number of damage &amp; drama points it can take. Drama points means success for the game. Damage means the game ends. The max numbers for the Yamato will be much greater than drama stuff.<br/><br/>--Individual player ships will certainly have a max number of damage. I'm not sure what drama points would be good for, maybe repairing the ship  (removing the ship's damage)? <br/><br/>--When a player receives damage, they decide <b>where</b> the damage is applied (the Yamato, his ship, his drama stuff), but one of the *other players* <b>narrates </b>the outcome. Maybe the player that inflicts the damage gets to narrate?
