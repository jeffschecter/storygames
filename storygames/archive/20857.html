I can see an issue arising, that as we have to continue to divide into more groups that I will likely have problems getting enough facilitators/GMs to cover all the groups for every session. I'm trying to encourage people to take the plung and try out the role, but at the same time I want to be sensitive to people who are uncomfortable doing so (one never knows if someone suffers from social anxiety for example). Has anyone dealt with this issue? And if so did you find a way to recruit more people willing to facilitate/GM? I know that this is a common problem and it may be a useful discussion for those facing a similar situation (even for singular groups).

For example, I might select a game specifically with an eye towards it being something a given player might like to run as a GM, then we play it for a month or whatever, and, should the player be interested, they will have a good starting point for running the game independently later. I might even participate for a bit as a player if the game is complex and the GM needs encouragement, but sooner or later they'll be able to operate independently, freeing me up to train more GMs (or just play, or run games, or whatnot).<br/><br/>For explosive growth it's possible to intentionally start your first group with GM-grade players, train them all at once, and thus get multiple tables worth of GMs out of the deal. You could theoretically put these new GMs into training duty, too, if you needed a very large amount of GMs for a single game. Difficult to think up a scenario where you'd need that many GMs that quickly, though.<br/><br/>Of course this relies on you recognizing the potential GMs out of the player pool, but I don't think that's too difficult: you just observe your co-players, pick out the ones who seem motivated about the art form, and get to know them a bit. Ask them about it, and let the idea mature over time. If they're interested in GMing, they'll pay more attention to the game as it is played, simply because they're reflecting on the process, pondering upon whether they could run the show themself. Give them a game text to read, too, or whatever - the particulars depend on the game.<br/><br/>My experience with random player sampling (a new gaming club, for example, built entirely out of newbies) is that about 7/10 players are casual, 2/10 are fair-weather GMs, and 1/10 has the natural inclination for the task (propensity for leadership, artistic vision and project responsibility, mainly). Because a certain fraction of the casual player base drops out over time, my experience is that older groups approach a situation where about half of the players are casual while the rest are potential (or actual) GMs; this means that a given circle of gamers should not have a dearth of GMs over time, assuming that they foster each other's growth and encourage trading off responsibilities.<br/><br/>One more observation: you will probably find it easier to get over natural hesitation if you focus on non-GMed games when first introducing people to running games. The reason is that even a person who suits the GMing task will be naturally hesitant about taking on all the involved responsibilities at once. That same person will probably be much more comfortable running a non-GMed game that resembles a boardgame in terms of operator tasks: they can learn the rules, explain the rules and call the rules during the game, without having to put themselves on the spot as the designer of an adventure or whatever. I'm thinking of games like <i>Fiasco</i> or <i>Zombie Cinema</i> - I've seen several people get their first taste of game facilitation with the latter, and it's been a functional stepping stone into becoming a GM. Once you're successful in facilitating a low-pressure game like that, it's easy to start thinking more ambitiously.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457873/#Comment_457873" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-05T20:31:50+00:00" title="November  5, 2016  8:31PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Running a dungeon crawly type module in a D&amp;D game is also a great way to get introduced to GMing, because the boundaries are so effectively set.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457875/#Comment_457875" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-05T20:57:46+00:00" title="November  5, 2016  8:57PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 5, 2016 9:11PM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited November 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a><br/>Thanks Eero, incredibly good advice! I think you are absolutely right about starting people off as facilitators of simple collaborative story games and letting them slowly get comfortable enough to GM. Thus far we have played all one-shots and next week will be our first two session game; we are trying to play as many games and genres as possible. Our sessions will probably end up being somewhere between 1-3 per a game. I don't think we will have any long campaigns for a while and those will likely only be about 5 sessions max, unless the desires of the club members unexpectedly change. While, this is a good model for us, it is not ideal for play-testing one another's games, which is an very important part of the club's mission. Anyway, because of a short number of sessions for each game and the desire not to play the same game twice until it is necessary, I was thinking <b>instead</b> of having potential GMs play a game for a number of sessions and then see if they would have an interest in GMing it, I would instead have to have them pick a game that they already have an interest in and then give them a lot of time to read it and then prepare and get comfortable enough to Facilitate/GM it. Do you think this would be a good alternative approach for our needs? Do you think that this approach could be improved upon? I might end up having to have different groups play different games.

We only play Indie RPGs and Story Games; playing D&amp;D is kind of antithetical to our mission, even for this purpose. It is a good idea; especially, if it was a simple version like classic D&amp;D.

On the other hand, many strains of story games both trad and new-style are actually really difficult to GM, simply because they wade so deep into independent artistry. Like, if the game requires you to outright impose an artistic vision and then deliver that for the other players, that's quite a threshold to cross. The right sort of person will do it, even without anybody encouraging them into it, but it's not going to happen in a social setting where somebody else is already GMing - much easier to be a player in the group than take on that challenge.<br/><br/>Regarding learning games, my instincts say that it's not the easiest and most encouraging way to become a GM by picking up a game like homework, study it and then run it. This is, in fact, almost like the "cargo cult" situation so familiar to some of us. I, for example, learned roleplaying originally from scratch, with no experienced gamers in town; we only had books to learn from. It's not nearly as easy as getting to play with others and learning the best practices from experienced players. I feel that asking a new GM to run a game that they've never played before is sort of half-way into that already, even if they've had the opportunity to play <i>other</i> games before. (I suppose I particularly think this way because of how much I appreciate game-specific play technique - I think it often results in inferior play when you try to forcibly apply experience with one game to some entirely different game.)<br/><br/>Considering your needs as a club, couldn't you have players facilitate/GM games that have been played before, but for new people who missed them on the first pass? This arrangement would have certain natural advantages to it:<br/><b>*</b> The "debut date" for the new GM would be set in a sort of organic manner by the entrance of new club members; you could just ask the soon-to-be-GM to run a game once there's a group's worth of folks who weren't there when that game was last featured. Might be next week, might be next month. If some old-timer wants to join in for a second run of the game, well why not.<br/><b>*</b> The new GM is in a natural leadership position compared to club newcomers simply because they've been there before and know the people and the way things are done. This situates them naturally to command attention and teach the game to people who joined the club after them - they're a "sempai", as the Japanese would have it <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><b>*</b> Games that people liked before would get a natural rerun. I've myself conducted similar short-game clubs, and I've found that they benefit from a certain amount of re-exploration of old ground: many games have depth to be appreciated on a second run, and the occasionally returning to an old favourite helps newcomers get up to speed on shared experiences that the old-timers have together.<br/><br/>Also, as you say, you probably should have different games at different tables once you go to multiple GMs. Trying to synchronize and train and prep several GMs to run the same game during the same night is likely not worth the trouble when you could instead have GMs each facilitate the games that they are particularly interested themselves. This way the players in turn get a range of choice, too; I remember a certain game club in Jyv\xe4skyl\xe4 that used to make this exact thing quite a feature, as each weekly session of the club would begin with interested GMs pitching their games to the crew, after which the players would separate into tables on the basis of interest. It can be a bit cruel and exciting as a creative process, as it's possible that nobody wants to play your game, but that's the creative life for you.<br/><br/>If you want to go with the idea of newbie GMs running new games from scratch, I would suggest working closely with them on it: tell them how to prep, review the prep with them (if they want to - I'm not suggesting a pushy attitude), set clear deadlines for when play will happen, and listen to their worries. Run a practice scene or two if they need it. You should take on some responsibility as a mentor, and it would be best if they could confide in you in terms of artistic doubts and technical uncertainties in advance. They may or may not want you to observe their play, too - I've seen new GMs appreciate an observer/prompter, but also those who don't want anybody second-guessing them, so it's best to ask them about it.<br/><br/>Part of the reason for the micromanagement style I suggest is obviously about a certain sort of psychological manipulation: by taking the GMing debut seriously you encourage the future GM to commit psychologically to the idea that they'll be doing it; by showing them that you care by mentoring them you motivate them to do it, so it doesn't just remain idle talk. I think that being a slight bit intense is better than being thoroughly laid-back about this sort of thing, if you want to encourage the other person to actually go through with it.<br/><br/>(Obviously you can also be too intense - it's in fact pretty easy for an experienced roleplayer to be too intense, just like any practitioner of an art. Do keep in mind that it's all in good fun, and GMing isn't a performance sport - at least, it shouldn't be according to my Very Serious Roleplaying Philosophy.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457879/#Comment_457879" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-05T22:09:34+00:00" title="November  5, 2016 10:09PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 5, 2016 10:11PM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited November 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a>\n<blockquote>Regarding learning games, my instincts say that it's not the easiest and most encouraging way to become a GM by picking up a game like homework, study it and then run it.

As the game is being learned there is often questions concerning rules that interrupt the experience and people get more comfortable with repeated play and understand how the game works and what their role is in it.

I always put "Newcomers Welcome! No Experience Needed!" in the Meetup heading, along with our name "Indie RPGs &amp; Story Games" and the game we are playing that week. Ben Robbins is the one who told me to put the "Newcomers Welcome! No Experience Needed!" thing in because it helped at SG Seattle; I really think that part is the key to getting new people, and maybe a consistent name. I also let people know that the game has no limit when it comes to numbers of players and that we divide into multiple groups if needed. Also, because we do short games, mostly one-shots so far, people can come on the weeks they have open and not be required to come all the time. I have a number of regulars that always shows up every week, an average of about one person a week will show up of the irregulars, and then we get about one totally new person showing up per a week and they usually become regulars.

Our GMless sessions have been more fun in my opinion, but maybe this is because we don't really have any totally amazing GMs, although the other GM is much better than me. I also like your one-shot model that assures that new people can show up whenever, and there is no week to week commitment. We have been doing one-shots so far and the only downside that I can see is that it limits the number of games we can play to those that fit a one-shot.

However, a lot of them require particular skills or particular approaches to "work"; so it's good to have someone on hand who's played before, or a good guide.<br/><br/>Another thing I've seen work sometimes - particularly if there is in interest in learning, and people who want to get their feet wet - is to have some "gaming experiments". These might be interesting for novelty's sake, and attract people.<br/><br/>For instance, a gaming club I was in once had a one-shot adventure with a single PC and four GMs. The first GM would "start off" the adventure (while the other three frantically took notes), and at each hour, on the hour, the GM seat would switch to the next player. I wasn't part of the game, but everyone involved had a blast.<br/><br/>I like the idea of forming a "team" to GM games. Takes some of the pressure off any one individual.<br/><br/>One way I've seen this work is a dual-GM game, where one GM is in charge of framing scenes, narrating events, and so forth, while the second GM is in charge of keeping track of the rules, rolling dice, calling out modifiers, and so forth. You could even add a third GM who plays all the NPCs. It's worth experimenting with!<br/><br/>"Murderous Ghosts" is a great game to take a look at, as well, because it effectively teaches one player to GM, without requiring any prior experience or knowledge. It's for 2 players, but you could have a "team" on either side, taking turns making decisions.<br/><br/>Finally, sometimes it could work to play into people's competitive instincts: <br/><br/>At that same gaming club, we had something called "The Gaming Circle". Everyone who signed up took on a certain date (games were on Saturdays), on which they would run a one-shot. During the other Saturdays, the current GM would grab players from the Gaming Circle pool for their own one-shot. (There were about 10 people in the club, and only about half available at any given time, so it worked great.)<br/><br/>Other than regular gaming for everyone, the reasons it worked really well:<br/><br/>* The general level and expectations kept rising. A few people ran really fun games, and everyone else wanted to step out to match that level. The games kept getting better and better! Everyone wanted to match or outdo the previous game, and some of the best gaming I've ever seen came out of this "Gaming Circle". Each person could plan months ahead and really put some thought into running a game they were excited about.<br/><br/>Some games would spin off into campaigns, and develop their own game groups, if after a one-shot enough people clamoured for an "encore".<br/><br/>* The "one-shot" environment encourages forethought and care, but also allows for a variety of experimentation. People wanted to try fun things, new things, and there were many neat ideas (like the above 4 GMs/1 player construction).<br/><br/>* People who hear about great games and want to be part of it would know that they need to step up and organize a game themselves - everyone was responsible for one Saturday when they signed up. This could make it a desirable group to be part of, and make people think about running games, learning systems, and what makes a fun session. "What would I need to do in order to be able to run a game as part of this?"<br/><br/>I could see all of these being a downside, as well, but I think that, so long as you provide alternatives for other players, it shoudn't be a problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457921/#Comment_457921" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-07T12:44:11+00:00" title="November  7, 2016 12:44PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's also pretty easy to facilitate multiple GMless games simultaneously as a sort of external guide, once you are comfortable with it.

I think the best way to learn broadly applicable "good GM skills" is to play lots of games.  Yes, you won't be as good a D&amp;D DM as someone who has done nothing but run D&amp;D for the past decade, but you'll be one hell of a lot better at running Mouse Guard than he will.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457940/#Comment_457940" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-07T18:29:05+00:00" title="November  7, 2016  6:29PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experience about training GMs matches with Airk's - you want a generalist GM, you need to form a sense for the entire medium. Also, it's not just skills, but the entire creative mind-set that is shaped by our gaming experiences; by playing only D&amp;D (or whatever) you can get a GM who runs good D&amp;D, but who also only <i>enjoys</i> running D&amp;D, which is counter-productive for learning other games later on because why would you when you're already having fun with D&amp;D. This isn't a big brain damage deal or anything like that, but it does mean that you'll need to pick your moment to introduce experienced people to new things; they already have a lot of things they like to do, so new experiences won't have as much room in their heads <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457942/#Comment_457942" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-07T18:38:17+00:00" title="November  7, 2016  6:38PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that creating the proper mindset from the beginning - "These are different games; a good GM is one who can learn or figure out the principles a particular game functions on, and then bring those to the players" - might be a good thing here.

Also, making sure players have the right mind set (i.e. understanding that becoming a talented GM takes time and being patient with others while they learn the ropes). If a player complains about how someone GMed it might be an opportunity to say something like: "Yeah, maybe you could GM a session to take the game in a direction that you would prefer."

I really love the idea of guest GMs; I think the idea about play testing is absolutely brilliant! The GM gets to playtest their game and we get some great instructions--win-win!

Maybe I could post on forums etc. to find someone fairly close to SLC, UT that is a good match <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Thank you for your excellent ideas! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457957/#Comment_457957" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-07T20:05:30+00:00" title="November  7, 2016  8:05PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeff I should caution that it is pretty demanding and not a great long-term solution.
