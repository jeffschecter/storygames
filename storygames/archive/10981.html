We just finished up the World Burner and got to the Beliefs stage of the characters. We are going to be continuing the character burner next time, but looking ahead, I am thinking about intent during phases.<br/><br/>I think I get what intent is about, but does anyone have good advice on how to pick a good intent for the Vaylen (or the humans)?

Then you can add windowdressing to it, narrative context.<br/><br/>Like, in our current BE game the Vaylen's intent is "change government to dictatorship." The color for that is: "Dismantle the human government and put (Vaylen Supreme Badass FON) at the head of the new regime."<br/><br/>I think it's easy-ish for players to get kind of scared of what's possible, but since everyone's discussing intent out loud, I think both sides can/will settle on just how "big" is "too big" as far as the intent's fictional color goes.<br/><br/>BTW the human's intent in our game is "Capture (Vaylen Supreme Badass FON) and execute him." It's big, it's bold, it's a game changer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_243675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243675/#Comment_243675" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-25T10:20:17+00:00" title="November 25, 2009 10:20AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can you nail down for me what about those intents is cool?

But oh! Those dirty Vaylen want to tear it down. It's transgressive. It's taking something we agreed to, something BIGGER than any given maneuver intent, and having the GM say "yeah...I'm gonna upturn the apple cart."<br/><br/>And executing VIPs is always a big deal. That one's kind of...tricky, though, since that COULD happen even via a single ICHASHITF roll. So we're all, like, agreeing that the VIP has a sort of script immunity since neither side really wants to invalidate the cool phase intent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_243756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243756/#Comment_243756" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-25T15:18:45+00:00" title="November 25, 2009  3:18PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul's game's phase intents are cool for several reasons (and what he said).<br/><br/>Every bit of narration is a weapon. You only get to say so much, so you need to make it all count. If the GM takes over the government, it may just be fictional, but holy cow that gives him ammunition to hammer the PCs super-hard with. Plus he gets to look over at the players and say "Yeah, your government is mine. One of us goes, both of us goes. Whatcha gonna do about that?"<br/><br/>On the player's side, killing a GMFoN is a serious blow to the other side. If the GMFoN is tied to a future phase, the GM can't replace him if he gets killed. Otherwise, it's just a huge morale boost for the players. Killing a FoN with a face-stab can be awesome, but might also feel anti-climactic, while killing a defeated FoN at the end of the game can come as a given. But working for a whole phase to whack one dude and then succeeding has the potential to be the most emotionally and narratively rewarding of all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243761/#Comment_243761" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-25T15:35:35+00:00" title="November 25, 2009  3:35PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah. Narration-as-weapon probably deserves entire books written on the subject.

IE nobody at the table <i>cares</i> that the planet stops producing raw materials and starts producing hovercars. Big fucking deal. There's nothing ideological at stake (assuming of course the game's premise isn't built on some sort of "industrialization will ruin our planetary heritage" type thing...in which case, starting up a hovercar factory would be a huge blow to the space hippies).<br/><br/>In our own game, the "dismantle the imperial stewardship and put the Vaylen at the head of the new regime" Phase intent is ultrahot because one of the FONs is the Imperial Steward, a powerhungry, protective bastard who sincerely believes the planet's well-being is only possible through his rule. It was already hot because it hands the Vaylen a bunch of implied narrative authority, but it crosses over to sublime because it punches a player's character concept square in the nuts. It's the ultimate challenge: <i>if you really are the planet's only salvation, how hard will you fight to maintain control</i>?<br/><br/>I suppose all I'm really saying is that Phase-level Intents have to matter exactly the same way as roll-level Intents: Say Yes or Roll the Dice, right? We gotta care if we're gonna roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244036/#Comment_244036" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-28T09:09:06+00:00" title="November 28, 2009  9:09AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is it best if the two sides' intents are directly opposed?
