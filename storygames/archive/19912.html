It's a big thinking-feeling furpile.  I feel for these people.  I think Mika Brzezinski is a giant douche(or possibly a turd sandwich?)for not being able to keep her composure during the MSNBC news thing.  I'm not even going to call what news is now a news story, because I think those are rare, like a brown unicorn.<br/><br/>Anyway, I was struck with the drama and also the comedy of the thing.  It's horrible, but it's beautiful.  Please don't misunderstand me, I hope the 19 who went to the hospital are healthy, and I hope they find out who did it and why.   <br/><br/>This would make a great story, or I'm guessing a great many stories told from many angles.<br/><br/>It should center on the 19 that were hospitalized, because for whatever reasons I view them as more important then the others who weren't.  <br/><br/>Were those 19 people in one wing of a hospital?  I want to know more!<br/><br/>So, I imagine that the majority of play takes place in the hospital.<br/><br/>Possible character roles would be 1. patient(furry), 2. friend of, 3. relative of, 4. hospital staff, 5. law enforcement, 6.  media(reporters)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440877/#Comment_440877" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-13T19:36:19+00:00" title="December 13, 2014  7:36PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Would this be better told like a who done it?  <br/>I guess that's the initial(driving) question, knowing the barest of details about the crime.  It's certainly the elephant in the room.  I could see it not needing to drive all the narratives.  It seems very likely that it would drive the narrative in scenes with the police.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
