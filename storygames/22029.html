I described him as singing an eerie song as he walked away, clearly performing magic through his song, and one of our players thought about it and said "I know what he's singing," and spontaneously sang us <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFVAoIU8vTM" rel="nofollow">Nina Simone's "Tomorrow Is My Turn."</a> Given our history with that character, it was a startlingly perfect song \u2014\xa0it references how no one knows the future (when this character does, because he's seized control of an Oracle), and how we can try to erase the past, but "It's too late to regret, what is gone will be no more." (Which could be read as a reminder that the party took his lover from him and hid her in memories, where she'll never be found, but he's forging onward anyway.) And it repeatedly comes back to what sounds like a threat: "Tomorrow is my turn," which sounds like foreshadowing for his next move.<br/><br/>We've had a lot of fun in this game with singing to each other \u2014\xa0when my character was badly injured, the party found her hiding in darkness and recovering, singing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoPlEZI8UPA" rel="nofollow">Bill Caddick's "John O'Dreams"</a> to herself as a comfort lullaby. A bard battle between that siren and our bard had both players writing and bringing songs to the game, with very different tones \u2014 hers an upbeat singalong about life on our ship on the Sea of Salt, his a dark, threatening warning about the Magus leading us into peril. We've gotten to the point where we encourage each other to sing, and talk a lot about how music could shape specific scenes.<br/><br/>I've run across RPGs where music was a mechanic or a theme, but this is the first game I've been in where singing was a regular feature and storytelling tool solely because of the people involved. I'd be curious to hear about other people's experiences with incorporating real performance or recorded music into their games to assist in telling the story, especially for conveying emotions.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482148/#Comment_482148" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-19T20:51:51+00:00" title="April 19, 2019  8:51PM">April 19</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That\u2019s a fabulous story.

So the players decided it was also the birthday of that player's character. And as a birthday gift, the other PCs cast a ritual so that everyone at their high school believed they were in a musical. Everyone would spontaneously burst into song and choreographed dances to express their feelings. (My favorite part was the school bully NPC, who had an amulet protecting him from mental magic. So he was the only person in school who recognized that it was odd for everyone to be singing and dancing and all that. He thought he was going insane, and everyone else thought he was being weirdly standoffish.)<br/><br/>The players improvised songs throughout the game (later reprising previous songs in new contexts just as a musical would). Different songs exposed people's personalities and emotions in ways we wouldn't have seen otherwise. <br/><br/>It worked really nicely, in part because we agreed early on: people can sing well, or sing badly, or describe characters singing without actually singing themselves. All methods were acceptable and encouraged, because that way every player could be happy and comfortable. Forcing someone to sing when they didn't want to would have been terrible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482206/#Comment_482206" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-21T01:52:13+00:00" title="April 21, 2019  1:52AM">April 21</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Bricoleur" rel="nofollow">Bricoleur</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> </p><blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I'm a professional musician who never uses music in any way in my gaming.

I suppose part of it is that I don't play (games) with other musicians, part is that one is work and the other is play (playing games happens as a way to get away from professional pursuits, after all), and part is that I am not a singer. Getting a bunch of instruments ready and tuned and set up while playing a game... sounds rather complicated and unnecessary. And, even then, what would I do with them?<br/><br/>I'll have to ponder this further, I suppose. Hmmm.<br/><br/>Writing skills are used a whole lot in gaming anyway (in most contexts, that is), so it's not a stretch. But I've never seen anyone bring an instrument to a game session.<br/><br/>If I was playing games with a bunch of musical theatre types, on the other hand, I would be absolutely shocked if no one ever broke out into song (that's just what those people love and tend to do at the drop of a hat, after all!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bricoleur" title="Bricoleur"><img alt="Bricoleur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/102/nF1YBT6EAKPBY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bricoleur">Bricoleur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482218/#Comment_482218" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-21T06:03:56+00:00" title="April 21, 2019  6:03AM">April 21</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" rel="nofollow">NickWedig</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>In our Misspent Youth game about illegal teenage magick, one session was on a player's birthday.

It sounds amazing, and like exactly what I'd like to see more of in games. Reminds me of a World of Darkness crossover game I was once in (we had one Hunter, one mage, a familiar, and a couple Changelings) where we had a musical episode for similar reasons \u2014\xa0a siren had come to town, and everyone was spontaneously expressing themselves through song, more or less like the Buffy musical episode. The GM invited us to bring in recorded music to play as songs we were singing, and he also assigned songs for us \u2014\xa0like my changeling and the mage were always arguing over whether to charge into something or research it and consider it first, so when we inevitably ran into that situation, the GM pulled out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWVMXLSS1cA" rel="nofollow">Elvis Presley's "A Little Less Conversation"</a> for him, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXzvAKp1W-4" rel="nofollow">Madison Avenue's "Who The Hell Are You"</a> as my response. But we didn't do any spontaneous singing or reprises. Your version sounds more fun!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
