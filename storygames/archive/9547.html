The group is gonna be a rock band trying to break through, yeah? They haven't made their characters yet. My vague plan is to have them sign a contract with a guy who'll use their music to control people's minds. And once they've signed the deal (which is in dense legalese), it'll be impossible for them to break it. Now they're forced to tour around making people the slaves of this evil genius guy.<br/><br/>So that's the situation. I have no other plans, as I'll structure the story around the characters. However, I want to have a roster of interesting NPCs to throw into the mix when the story demands it (like "Oh, they have to find this book. Uh ... of course! THIS guy has it. And he's the mortal enemy of this other guy they're already friends with.").<br/><br/>So. Make me some NPCs. Feel free to give me cool NPCs or PCs from your own UA games, or just make some cool shit up. Giving them hooks is great, giving them relationships to each other is not so great, since I want to do that on the fly. And don't feel restricted to the "x-mancer" or "avatar of this archetype in the rulebook" thingie in UA. I'm gonna be free-wheeling magic, so making up unique schools and archetypes is awesome.<br/><br/>If you wanna stat the NPCs, that's great, but you don't have to, and adding something to something someone else wrote is cool, too.<br/><br/>(I was gonna do a thread called "Make my character for me", but I'm gonna GM for the next couple of sessions, so I did this instead. Someone else should make that thread.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211837/#Comment_211837" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-12T01:40:16+00:00" title="June 12, 2009  1:40AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I stole this from somewhere, but I've used it and it came in handy.<br/><br/>Gideon is a guy in prison. He's serving life in prison without the possibility of parole. Thing is, he's been in prison for the last 200 years. As long as he's in jail, he's immortal, which is why he doesn't try to leave. The jail administration knows he's immortal (some of them), but it's a dirty secret no one talks about. He's been ''passed down'' from warden to warden, for the last 200 years. If you're behind bars, this man is your king, not the warden.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212055/#Comment_212055" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-12T19:37:41+00:00" title="June 12, 2009  7:37PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've always wanted to throw in an NPC with no eyes, and two Unspeakable Servants. Probably some black-market dealer of assorted occult books and trinkets, who is always the creepier for the fact that you never know where he's watching you from. <br/><br/>(Plus, unnatural phenomenon follow Unspeakable Servants like a plague, so shit always gets weird around him.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
