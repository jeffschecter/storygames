Surely this means *something* good about the maturity of the gaming community and the way we're learning to communicate with one another.<br/><br/>A round of beverages for everyone! Hurrah!<br/><br/>That said, I think it would be quite interesting at this point to consider what are some good, strong arguments *against* the whole concept. After all, any concept deserves testing, and a number of threads explaining and arguing *for* a certain thing need to find some balance elsewhere.<br/><br/>Let's use this thread to list some important objections to the whole model - particularly ones which are at least somewhat verifiable and suggest the Model is seriously misguided (not just, say, incomplete - I don't think the Beeg Horseshoe Theory or the idea that there are three CA modes do much to disqualify the theory, merely amending it).<br/><br/>Needless to say, let's keep up the positive and inquisitive vibe here. No one is here to judge anyone else's gameplay, ego, or expertise. If you ARE, take it elsewhere.

Real gaming groups are better off with a game* which gives you the flexibility to adapt to each player's needs and include a bit of everything for everyone.<br/><br/>1.b) The strong version: "Coherent" gaming is a myth, period. All gaming is "incoherent" by Big Model standards, and people have lots of fun playing this way. "Incoherent" gaming IS roleplaying, in other words. <br/><br/>Additionally, the GM and players have fundamentally different roles, and perhaps it's not even *possible* to identify any kind of unified approach to playing which would apply to a whole group.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Note: By necessity (because System is defined as, essentially, "the way we play this game right now"), Forge theory conflates the <i>text of the game</i> with the <i>techniques being used at this moment by this group</i>, so it's impossible to speak of a set of game rules entirely separately from a particular gaming group's interpretation of that game text. So, when I use the term "game", above, I'm referring to the time and place where an interpretation of a game text meets a gaming group in real life and what ensues.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446255/#Comment_446255" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-13T03:22:02+00:00" title="July 13, 2015  3:22AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            2. <b>Creative Agenda Modes do not Survive Contact with the Enemy</b><br/><br/>Essentially, Creative Agenda sounds all great and fine, but when it comes to an actual game in progress, no two people can agree on which CA mode is in effect. <br/><br/>This suggests that CA modes are not a real thing, or, perhaps, are expressed too vaguely to be of any real use. <br/><br/>I've seen a number of people who are very knowledgeable about the Big Model and supporters of it struggle with this issue.

The theory promises that they are, and there are difficulties with defining modes without this property (rather, it's questionable if CA modes <i>matter</i> at all unless they actually signify Creative Agendas that work well together), but the only overt reasoning in support is basically that surely two people with similar interests will be capable of understanding and appreciating each other's play, given a subject matter and technical tools they both like. Surely a Gamist will recognize that same spirit in another Gamist and respond to it, bringing coherence to the human encounter?<br/><br/>Even more nefariously, empiric investigation of this matter is especially unreliable because of the tendency towards explaining intra-modal disagreement and incomprehensibility as a "non-creative", "merely technical" or somehow incidental disagreement. It is also common to come to convenient analytical conclusions where creative disagreement just happens to be explained by the presence of two different CA modes instead of just one. All this could be because intra-modal creative incoherence is genuinely rare (the orthodox position), or it could be because GNS theorists are incapable of appreciating that all Creative Agendas are unique, and that there are no real guarantees to cohesion except human empathy and willingness to work together.<br/><br/>The counter-hypothesis, as indicated above, is that GNS modes do not exist, or they exist at most as guaranteed conflicts (caused by reward cycle incompatibilities, to be specific), and in fact a coherent creative agenda is caused by complex nuances and coincidences in creative inspiration. For example, two players of <i>Primetime Adventures</i> might cohere not primarily because they both desire and appreciate a narrativist expression, but because of a dozen different things ranging from personal chemistry to fondness for tv drama.<br/><br/>Any incidental success of GNS theory in achieving cohesion could be explained under this hypothesis, too: people are finding more cohesive play not because CA modes themselves are real, but rather simply because GNS analysis encourages them to talk about creative agenda, design for it and select their co-players with a cohesive agenda in mind. All these actions may still be fully viable even if the notion of playing for "Gamism" or "Narrativism" is actually an illusionary chimera that means whatever is most convenient in each individual gaming context. These people could as well be trying to play towards a "Polpotian" agenda mode and it would work the same as long as they managed to communicate a compelling creative vision to their co-players and chose a rules system matching that vision.<br/><br/>I would characterize this hypothesis as a minor assault upon the Forgite theoretical framework: although it attacks one of the oldest and most established "truths", the Big Model itself is not invalidated even if GNS theory unravels. As far as the Big Model is concerned, play either has a cohesive Creative Agenda or it doesn't, but the model doesn't tell you how to bring that about. GNS does, but is it correct in claiming that agenda mode coordination brings about coherence?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446261/#Comment_446261" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-13T03:51:47+00:00" title="July 13, 2015  3:51AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, your counter-theories sound pretty true-to-life to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446263/#Comment_446263" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-13T04:25:36+00:00" title="July 13, 2015  4:25AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 13, 2015 4:28AM by AsIf.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my experience cohesive play and fun are neither internally-consistent nor previously-arranged.  They are dynamic, human, diverse, often unplanned, and just as often uncategorizable.  Fun flexible people make things fun and flexible.  That's why I consider the GNS model useful as a critical tool but useless as a method of describing anything people actually do.  Sessions bounce around inside the model, systems include modes within other modes, GMs run breakout scenes and subgames with different modes, players have different moods which cause them to play in different modes on a given night, and even the model itself is fractal.  IMNSHO, of course. :-)<br/><br/>I'm not against the GNS model.  I like it, as models go.  It's useful for designers to think about.  But I am against assuming that it's empirically meaningful as a description of real players, that its modes are categorically exclusive of each other, or that its modes are normative (negatively definitional or limiting) upon any class of player activity.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446265/#Comment_446265" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-13T05:24:49+00:00" title="July 13, 2015  5:24AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tod,<br/><br/>Is your point of view that single-CA mode play just doesn't occur "in nature" (because of this "bouncing around"), or that gaming is MORE FUN when this "bouncing around" happens?<br/><br/>My understanding of GNS - although I don't know if this non-controversial - is that G, N, and S priorities are always present in any kind of gaming. Playing "coherently" isn't about cutting out the other two altogether, but, rather, about what the group does when they come into conflict. (For instance, Eero's Gamist dungeon crawls often feature a great deal of logistics, world-building, background history, and other things which normally do not seem to align with Gamist priorities. What makes the game Step On Up, however, is how we use those techniques to support or undermine the CA itself. Is handling the logistics of feeding 100 people on the journey something we can use to highlight the challenge of the adventure, or a distraction? Similarly for thematic concerns, presumably, although I don't remember those coming up as much when we played.)<br/><br/>(A lot of your other comments in this post, as far as I know - I'm not a big expert - are in line with the Big Model. For instance, as discussed previously, it doesn't actually act as "a description of real players", not at all.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446267/#Comment_446267" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-13T05:28:43+00:00" title="July 13, 2015  5:28AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 13, 2015 5:29AM by Rickard.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Big Model is written for one of the creative agendas: narrativism.

They manage to do a good job covering 2 of the 3 main bases, though usually one is in clear support of the other.<br/><br/>Some examples:<br/>-Riddle of Steel: the unforgiving combat system and other aspects of the game are deeply Sim-supporting, but the Spiritual Attributes are entirely Narr. I'd characterize TRoS as Sim in support of Narr.<br/><br/>-Some of the AW games seem to have a mix of either Gam and Sim or Sim and Narr<br/><br/>-BW, of course<br/><br/>Now, the counter-argument here could be found in my recent obsession with TA, rather than CA: maybe TRoS (or whatever) is simply using technical tools that are simulat<i>ive</i>, but the game's reward cycle is clearly rooted in Narr play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446272/#Comment_446272" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-13T05:46:56+00:00" title="July 13, 2015  5:46AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Matt, isn't that entirely in line with the Big Model?

So I'm not talking about those.  I'm really talking about RPG campaigns in general, and about sessions played within the context of such campaigns.  I'm saying that in my experience, the modes coexist at the same table, within the same game system, and even within a single player from one hour to the next, and that that diversity is not necessarily the cause of anyone's bad experience.  I think using GNS as a diagnostic tool for "when games go bad" is probably bound to lead to a kind of superstitious misdiagnosis, ignoring much finer points about human psychology and the game itself.<br/><br/>I'd say that the desire for a single-CA approach is based on a strictly limited assumption about where fun and coherence come from.  I find that fun and coherence can just as easily arise from breaking away from an agenda as from remaining within it, and I think it's a mistake to consider these modes as at odds with each other, because they can exist on different levels simultaneously depending on the design, that's why I say it's fractal.  And although this is a side-point, I also think that for the most highly interactive - meaning least predictable - experiences, agenda can really only be pre-discussed in a negative (i.e. editorial, restrictive) way (see conversations about the X card, lines/veils, etc).<br/><br/>I think the GNS model is useful in the same way that Zodiacal signs or Myers-Briggs Types are useful.  I.e., not at all for communicating a truly representative portrait of a real live individual, but generally practical as a broadly-defined heuristic for talking about design intentions, or comparing in-game activity from one ruleset to another, etc.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446288/#Comment_446288" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-13T06:35:08+00:00" title="July 13, 2015  6:35AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, cool, thanks!

As mentioned earlier by Eero, some people think that, e.g., <i>Capes</i> simultaneously supports Gamism and Narrativism, by making it so that you have to play the same move to further both Agendas. Personally, I squint at that, and it feels more "right" to me to say that one Agenda will always predominate, but I can't really put my finger on why (and would be very happy to be proven wrong).<br/><br/>The rest of your notes seem to put you in the camp (a well-populated camp!) of people who say that their games are richer and better precisely because they don't limit themselves to a focused CA mode. "Incoherent" games are often touted as being better at creating fun for the players because they allow the group to shift continuously from one CA to another, rather than trying to support or enforce a focused mode of play.<br/><br/>That's something I'd like to see sometime, as well, as all my gaming experience suggests that the best experiences have been the focused ones, whereas the unfocused ones, while potentially very fun from a social angle (given the right group of people!), didn't really do it for me. (And I certainly wouldn't want to play with strangers, since most of the actual fun wasn't in the game itself, but the socializing with friends.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446295/#Comment_446295" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-13T06:53:43+00:00" title="July 13, 2015  6:53AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>* Note again, I'm a guy who prefers to view the GNS model in its horseshoe configuration.<br/></blockquote>\nYou know, I've never heard how or why the Horseshoe actually meaningfully departs from the Big Model. It seems like it's a fairly analogous model, just using a different metaphor, but all other conclusions should basically hold.

There are also arguments for multiple modes at the table.  For example, some people would say that having some competitive players can help drive more action and conflict in the game, which is good for narrative results of other players.  Likewise, a player who is more detail-oriented can help build a more believable backdrop to the game, which benefits other players who like a rich context for their address of premise.  Robin's Laws of Gamemastering espouses something like this, recommending a mix of player types.  <br/><br/>2) I think psychologically, the real motivations for play are tied to the real-world rewards - such as relief of stress, catharsis, ego boost, building social closeness, and so forth.  I'm not convinced that either "address of premise" or "idle curiousity" (as Eero characterizes Sim) are real motivations.  <br/><br/>3) I also don't see that Sim and Nar are distinct definitionally.  Address of premise seems to fit with idle curiosity about one aspect of play (the moral/ethical aspect). <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446306/#Comment_446306" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-13T07:11:42+00:00" title="July 13, 2015  7:11AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a devil's-advocacy counter-argument to the commercial success argument, I'll add that D&amp;D 4e was marketed as successor to, and replacement of, a game with a very different approach to CA and TA.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446307/#Comment_446307" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-13T07:16:14+00:00" title="July 13, 2015  7:16AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br/><br/>Thanks!

Remember that GNS is prescriptive on the matter of coherence: game designs should support coherent play, those that don't are damaging, incoherent play results in power struggles, dissatisfaction and unhappiness.  This is all part and parcel of the theory and its implications. So there are a lot of directions for incoherent play or design that could contradict this stance:<br/><br/>1.a.5? -&gt; Incoherent play doesn't, speaking generally, produce unhappiness.  If my particular Creative Agenda isn't necessarily completely satisfied in every moment of play that doesn't necessarily make me unhappy; I could be obtaining happiness from many other perfectly virtuous sources, or perhaps I am able to change gears and enjoy what I'm getting in a new way. Or what the players are doing can shift over time or my preferences might, and in a larger slice of time than one cycle of play, incoherent play (supported, one hopes, by incoherent design) might produce greater happiness for me. The evidence for this is partly found in the "commercial success" but also in the fact that the hobby survived for 25 years without developing GNS theory. <br/><br/>Then perhaps I'll go still further and say:<br/><br/>1.c -&gt;  The inability to change your Creative Agenda in response to those you are engaging with is a sign of a diseased and decrepit creative faculty....one might even call it.............damaged.  In other words, who the fuck are you to sit there being dissatisfied because your Creative Agenda isn't being supported by a long-dead game designer or what is happening in this exact moment of this exact game?  Why don't you pull your weight instead, and actually listen to what your fellow players are giving you, and give it back to them? (This goes for any of your fellow players who are having problem with the give-and-take as well.)<br/><br/>There, now we've got something.

Various types of backpedaling and attenuating on this point are common, perhaps because people cannot quit believe Forge theory to be that stupid, but that's how it goes: if you think that a game can be coherently both Gam and Sim at the same time, you're being heterodox about the theory, and Jason would be entirely within his rights to call you on that <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>(To clarify, I'm not saying that that it is evil or undesirable to be "heterodox", I just want to be clear on what the theory actually says. It's not GNS theory anymore if you're talking about some type of "play style" that can be freely mixed together out of a continuum of possibilities. "A little dash of Gamism to give an edge to my Narrativism" is a phrase that is utterly in conflict with what the GNS theory is attempting to communicate.)<br/><br/>Most similar "put gamers into boxes" theories do not feature strict typing like this, presumably because they are technical or historical categorizations, and the phenomena they attempt to categorize really are free recombinations of core concepts that form continuous spaces. GNS is, or at least believes itself to be, different in that it would be a logical fallacy to characterize play with multiple creative agendas at once.<br/><br/><b>2)</b> "Incoherent play leads to unhappiness" is not a prescription of the GNS theory, but it is an important background assumption for most people using the theory - it's why we're interested in Creative Agenda, because we think that its coherence is a key explaining factor for enjoyable play. Jason is in no way reaching when he chooses to critique that assumption, but it is at most a hit on the relevance of GNS, not on its correctness - GNS could still be right about the way Creative Agenda reaches coherence or incoherence, even if it happens to be the case that incoherent play is actually more fun and enjoyable than coherent play.<br/><br/>However, I will 100% underwrite that Forgite theorists generally believe that incoherent play is not fun, and that if somebody thinks that it is, it is most likely because they are misunderstanding the concept and think that their highly coherent game is incoherent e.g. because they're playing a game with an incoherent text. (For example, I'm playing Paranoia with my friends this summer, and it's a highly incoherent game text with strong Gam and Nar leanings. The actual execution of play is purely Gamist, and highly coherent.) Incoherent play is something where you get all excited about this excellent move you made, and then raise your eyes to see the blank stares of your fellow players who didn't understand, didn't care and didn't like what you just did. It is difficult to imagine that as a basis for enjoyable roleplaying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446342/#Comment_446342" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-13T14:21:30+00:00" title="July 13, 2015  2:21PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 13, 2015 2:30PM by JDCorley.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would suggest, based on 1.c, that such a reaction suggests primarily that you weren't paying attention to what they were giving you, or they weren't paying attention to you, or more likely both.

Basically, I disagree with the gist of this.<br/><br/><b>Definition:</b> Creative Agenda is a group's primary priority of what's cool, reinforced and validated by the group over a given instance of actual play, right? <br/><br/>How many primary priorities can a group have? Only one. If you have two, you can try to say that they're both equal and thus in first place, but you can't say that one serves the other in a /primary/ sense. That's why GNS theory /technically/ says "you got your peanut butter in my chocolate" or whatever is not fair cricket.<br/><br/>However, The Big Model happily accommodates this idea. There are Techniques -- things you do at the table -- that can support one CA more than another in that given game session. You could even say -- for that one game session -- that those Techniques serve one CA over another ("The Riddle of Steel's trait system pushed a Story Now CA, while its combat system was totally pushing Right to Dream"). You can have a big soup of different Techniques, all serving one /or more/ CAs at the same time in the same play session. <br/><br/>At the end of the game, though, you either pushed /primarily/ toward one (by definition, group-shared) priority, or you did not. Maybe you consciously pushed toward seven group-shared priorities. That's totally possible! I suspect Jason's group plays this way (consciously or not). The Big Model calls this incoherent play because it isn't "firing on all cylinders," to use a metaphor that got tossed around back in the day.<br/><br/>And, yeah, it's pejorative and people need to stop doing that. The general feeling was that you probably could make your game play better if you got all cylinders firing, if you all got on the same page, or if you all pushed in the same direction (more metaphors). The general feeling was that incoherent play wasn't /bad/, but it was /suboptimal/, and that coherent play was /better/. I think that distinction got lost on a lot of people--including Forge adherents (and probably me!) who later spread the idea that if your game was incoherent, you were doing something wrong.<br/><br/>The wisdom of age and time have taught me that people who are having fun don't need my advice.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446352/#Comment_446352" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-13T15:48:03+00:00" title="July 13, 2015  3:48PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>My understanding of GNS - although I don't know if this non-controversial - is that G, N, and S priorities are always present in any kind of gaming.</blockquote>\nI don't think the theory says anything about all priorities (including CA) being present.<br/><br/>It says that priorities are brought to the table by players using Techniques, which are the building blocks of play that may serve or not serve one or more priorities.<br/><br/>I think it's a subtle, but vital, distinction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446353/#Comment_446353" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-13T16:20:18+00:00" title="July 13, 2015  4:20PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, cool. It's great to have Eero weigh in on this point. His understanding of the theory is not only more thorough but also more "correct" (in the sense that he more closely involved with the development of theory and its main proponents) than mine. (If John is also participating in this discussion, we can really say we have a thorough and informed take on the model and its development. That's nice!)<br/><br/>However, when it comes to this discussion of "mixing agendas" and the potential enjoyment of incoherent play, I wonder if we're dealing with a bit of a semantic quibble or if I really have a thoroughly unorthodox understanding of the whole GNS question.<br/><br/>It was always my understanding that, in coherent play,  a certain CA can be observed because the group will prioritize it when it comes into conflict with other priorities. However, other agenda-supporting techniques and small-scale priorities still exist, in various proportions. <br/><br/>Here's Ron from the original GNS essay (as hopelessly outdated as it is):\n<blockquote><br/> When someone tells me that their role-playing is "all three," what I see from them is this: features of (say) two of the goals appear in concert with, or in service to, the main one, but two or more fully-prioritized goals are not present at the same time. So in the course of Narrativist or Simulationist play, moments or aspects of competition that contribute to the main goal are not Gamism. In the course of Gamist or Simulationist play, moments of thematic commentary that contribute to the main goal are not Narrativism [...]<br/><br/>Over a greater period of time, across many instances of play, some people tend to cluster their decisions and interests around one of the three goals.<br/></blockquote>\nIs this something that changed over time, later?<br/><br/>Thinking about my own experiences playing D&amp;D with you (which were vey firmly Step On Up), I remember how much you emphasized certain elements of play which typically might be more indicative of Right to Dream creative interests: everything from florid descriptions to discussions of how local currencies functioned, and to developing a diegetic explanation for why dungeon locales existed or why plate mail was so unreasonably cheap.<br/><br/>My understanding is that, in Big Model terms, we can still diagnose Step On Up as our Creative Agenda because of the way we handled this material: it acted as context for the creation of challenges, fictional Colour, and were always ready to discard it or skip it if it came into conflict with our creative goals. Developing colourful histories for our characters or enjoying dialogue was handled in the same way: fun, but ready to be skipped or dropped when we were ready to get down to business.<br/>Another good example might be justifying the sudden presence of a new character after a PC death: it's desirable to make it fictionally believable, but not to the extent were we bend over backwards to make it work. More important to make sure that player has a role to play than to stay true to our fictional conceits or genre fidelity or any other Sim-flavoured concerns.<br/><br/>As for enjoyable incoherence, doesn't the model explicitly allow for functional incoherent play? My understanding there is that it certainly exists (how else to explain the many many gamers who intentionally play in this mode and insist they're enjoying themselves without getting into some weird semantic knot or just being an unjustified asshole?), but it makes it much harder for any given player - or the group - to satisfy their creative goals. They could still accomplish it with great effort, however, or groove on some kind social agenda or technical agenda and have a good time. (Much like how a film fan can really enjoy a movie while knowing that's it's a stupid or formulaic film.)<br/><br/>And I've *definitely* seen Ron describe his own play as "Narrativist with a fringe of friendly competition over character builds" and similar statements. (With the understanding that, like in our D&amp;D game, these priority give way to the actual Creative Agenda when push comes to shove, being in place only to support its existence where their presence wouldn't detract from it.)<br/><br/>Further clarifications welcome! I wouldn't be surprised if my understanding doesn't accord with the Big Model, or only accords with it at some point in its development.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446359/#Comment_446359" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-13T16:58:25+00:00" title="July 13, 2015  4:58PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Diagnosis of CA is so hard because it requires you to look at an entire session of play (maybe more than one) with the understanding of the participants (not an outsider), and find one or more particular instances where one CA is jettisoned for another. Because CA is about /priority/.<br/><br/>You can't just look at a Technique and say, "See? This supports Right to Dream, thus the whole game is Right to Dream." You have to find where a Technique is chosen to support some CA and someone else denies it; says, no, that's not it.<br/><br/>You see this in pretty amazing ways in "constructive denial" examples, where the whole table is course-correcting about some detail in, say, the setting, or a character, and once the correction has been made, everyone is nodding in vehement agreement.<br/><br/>But that course-correction occurs in all RPGs.

The latter terms were not laden with all the confused expectations and bad history that the Gamism / Narrativism / Simulationism terms were. (Pretty much every Sim discussion breaks down into lower-case-s simulationism debate, and pretty much every Narr discussion breaks down into lower-case-n narrativism/narration debate.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446362/#Comment_446362" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-13T17:21:11+00:00" title="July 13, 2015  5:21PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 13, 2015 6:01PM by Rickard.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Rickard,<br/><br/>I think that's a very worthwhile criticism of the Model, but can you go into a little more detail?</blockquote>\nJust look at how N is described contra S and G.

Alice decides to play a tough-as-nails sergeant who wants to win at all costs.  As a player, she is focused purely on showing off great tactical skill and winning  - what GNS calls "Step On Up".  Everyone likes how she is doing this, and gives her positive feedback when she pushes things tactically.  On the other hand, Ben is playing a new recruit who is torn over killing, and as a player enjoys making choices in the moral quagmire - what GNS calls "Story Now".  His choices can endanger the mission, and a few times even the team's lives.  He likes how Alice always focuses things on the tactics and pushes everyone to action, because the action makes things more interesting than spending too much time on hand-wringing. <br/><br/>Different players are pursuing different core goals, but they are optimally adding to each other's enjoyment.

This calumny about my D&amp;D having Simulationistic overtones is a great example, because it absolutely doesn't - it's whimsically and exuberantly Gamist, and Simulationist reward cycles are about as rare as a blue moon. The reason for why people might decide otherwise after witnessing the play is apparently that they're not paying attention to the actual Creative Agenda at all (that is, the reward cycles and creative motivations), but only at techniques utilized to achieve it. This is the same discussion we get about how Simulationism should be this or that, and two different games can't both be Sim because they are played so differently.<br/><br/>Considering the D&amp;D example, for instance: I use things like world-building, socio-psychological challenge scenarios and organic realism-oriented resolution because the creative agenda of the game is "to see whether we have what it takes to armchair-general adventurers into success in a fantasy world". This <i>cannot</i> occur if your game is all gamey with formally defined rules relationships that over-ride things like fictional positioning and causality. If a 100 commoners can "technically" lift you and hand you off to each other in a long line to enable you to move 500 feet in six seconds, whatever it is we have there isn't my D&amp;D.<br/><br/>The fact that my D&amp;D is all about setting cohesion and organic resolution procedures and whatnot is not proof of Simulationism, it's just an indicator that whatever the Creative Agenda is, it's something that works off that sort of stuff. As it happens (I can say, because I've been there to see the creative payoffs), what these techniques bring to the Gamist play is authenticity, inventiveness and gravitas of play, as the tactical and strategic play draws heavily upon humanist lores (to play this style of game successfully it is very helpful to know a lot about historical societies, historical warcraft, various folklores, story structures and so on) and the subject matters upon which the game turns aren't about "what it says on page 56 of the rulebook" but rather about things like credible ways to shortcut medieval sieges.<br/><br/>If the Creative Agenda of this style of D&amp;D <i>were</i> Simulationist, we would see e.g. the GM provide routine support for the players so they could play their characters better in the societal roles they represent - so playing a knight would be about acting knightly, with GM help if necessary, instead of playing a knight being a skill challenge that you can take on if you think that you've got what it takes. These kinds of things do not occur because we do not care about the overall fidelity of the simulation - it exists to provide a textured and meaningful field of struggle for the challenges recognized as the subject matter of play, not for its own sake. Sure, sometimes I look with satisfaction at how the game setting is shaping up into a detailed interlocked system with interesting emergent features, but that's just a craftsman's satisfaction at a job well done and expectation about how nice it'll be to see the players make a mess of it - very different from e.g. the reverent medievalism of Ars Magica, to pick another game of historical fantasy that for me is a Simulationist game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446401/#Comment_446401" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-13T21:52:56+00:00" title="July 13, 2015  9:52PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Eero, that's an excellent post.

The old players have carefully honed character builds and play their dungeon crawls like a carefully executed Seal Team Six plan.<br/><br/>New guy doesn't create a carefully honed character build, but at first no one else complains (or notices). During play, when the group is faced with a challenge that requires careful sneaking and backstabbing, new guy says that his monk stands up and yells, "I AM THE GOD OF HELLFIRE! YOU WILL ALL BOW BEFORE ME!" This results in a temple full of angry necromancers chasing the entire party out of the dungeon. Lots of hit points lost, potions and spells expended, and a near TPK (mostly because the DM pulls his punches, because, you know, this is kind of bogus). The party's elven fighter is killed.<br/><br/>The group doesn't invite new guy back. They have an internal discussion about how the new guy just /didn't take the game seriously/. They agree to retcon the last session.<br/><br/><br/>So there you have a somewhat fictional example of play. The "GOD OF HELLFIRE" thing in the temple followed by a near-TPK chase actually did happen in a 1e game I ran in the 80's. However, the party thought it was hilarious, though some of the group thought it was a waste of their time. Duke and his monk were still welcome in the party.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what Duke's creative goal was, though I suspect it was "do awesome, dramatic things like Indiana Jones" and I'm pretty sure about half of the rest of the party (often 8-10 people) was "get in, kill the monsters, get the treasure, level up" (pretty traditional Gamism / Step on Up).

Some feel that RPG's are inherently frivolous and reject out of hand that they can be subjected to artistic criticism at all, and disparage any attempt to do so as pseudo-intellectualism. Direct critics of the theory have argued that it doesn't really explain anything regarding player behavior and only serves to shoehorn game design down limited paths. Many casual players react negatively to the idea, complaining that it forces them into false dilemmas and draws artificial, wordy distinctions between elements that can, in practice, combine well with one another and mutually reinforce.</blockquote>\nThese seem like both good and recognizable critiques. I'll number them:<br/><br/>3. <b>Roleplaying games are not Art.</b><br/><br/>This view holds the roleplaying is not a meaningful artistic endeavour, and, therefore, trying to ascribe Creative Agenda to it is misguided at best and deliberately misleading, pretentious posturing at worst.<br/><br/>4. <b>The Theory is not Applicable to Actual Play... so it shackles Design</b><br/><br/>This view holds that the theory does not allow us to say anything meaningful about player behaviour, and, therefore, affects only game designers (with the implication that it limits their horizons for design).<br/><br/>(This last point clearly can't be applied to the Big Model in general, but could be leveled as a criticism at the idea of three separate Creative Agendas. I'll note that I've seen a lot *more* variety and innovation come out of Forge-influenced design, not *less*, so I find this point of view difficult to embrace.)<br/><br/>5. <b>Roleplaying is a casual activity: embrace the variety and all its weirdness</b><br/><br/>Somewhat related to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>, the idea here is that roleplaying is just not that serious. Trying to "focus" it on a specific creative goal takes the fun out of it: rather, what is FUN about roleplaying games is all the little ways the thing is silly. You're adults very seriously reacting to a story about a kidnapped princess played by a 40-something balding used car salesman. That's hilarious!

If the play is fun and functional, then there can't be incoherence. <br/><br/>Can you give what you consider to be an accurate picture of a case of incoherence in play?  </blockquote>\nI was merely drawing the distinction between what the GNS model predicts ("CA mode conflict results in incoherence") and what many Forgite theorists, including myself, believe ("Incoherent play is grimly unsatisfying for me, and I believe to most"). There is no insistence on incoherence entailing dysfunction.<br/><br/>A recent example of incoherence in play from last winter: we were playing D&amp;D 5th edition with a pretty clearly gamist, old school paradigm, with a historical fantasy setting - it wasn't plastered on the walls on posters or anything, but I thought the GM did a good job of explaining what they wanted to achieve, and there were several players in the group who grokked it.<br/><br/>When one of the player characters was bitten by a hellhound with an infernal poison to its bite, the player was very distressed. The character retreated back to town to seek aid. Earlier the same had happened to another character (with the same hellhound, too), and they'd resolved the issue by seeking a chirurgeon who amputated the bit appendage altogether (the character being a warlock, the player didn't consider this a career-ending injury), but was obviously wasn't satisfactory to the Barbarian.<br/><br/>The player's frustration visibly mounted through the next steps of discovery, as they found out that there were no "healing temples" in town, this being Danzig in the 15th century in a historical fantasy setting - the church could maybe help with exorcism or some such spiritual issues, but they could mostly offer prayer for poisonings (no PC-classed clerics on staff, you see). Other venues of investigation proved uncertain, expensive, fraught with peril, etc. - the challenge was mounting quite satisfactorily. The GM, realizing that the issue was pretty serious, offered the constructive solution of having the character take bed rest for several weeks to months to gain a bonus to their periodic saving throws, so as to beat the poisoning by toughing it out, as it were.<br/><br/>However, as the other players started chiming in with plans and stratagems for how to resolve the challenge, the player in question stood up, declared that he had gotten his surfeit of this grim mudshit game, and that we would be welcome to continue playing without him - he didn't come to play D&amp;D every week to die of a poisonous dogbite after investing weeks and weeks of work in developing his character to a respectable level. (His character was 4th level or something, vs. the 1st-2nd level characters most of the others were rocking; due to the high HP the barbarian had been saved the occasional dying that the old school gamism tended to cause.)<br/><br/>Now, I'm sure that people could interpret these events in different ways, but for me, considering that I know these people pretty well, it was pretty clear: the player in question is the single most clearly "middle school" oriented D&amp;D player in the group, while many others have "converted" to old school ways over the recent years. The disagreeing player's Creative Agenda in D&amp;D and similar games is very, very clearly Simulationistic "princess play", as I like to call it; he desires above all for a roleplaying game to be a leisurely exercise in free, phantasmagoric imagination, with everybody getting to participate and everybody "having fun" - which means not challenging the players to perform, and never failing in any serious manner. I've got years and years of experience with this player, I know what they like <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>The incoherence in this situation was specifically that just about everybody else at the table (perhaps discounting a few quiet hanger-on players who could take it or leave it, insofar as the different creative interests go - I think that there was one or two of those in that session) was excited about the situation and considered it entirely ordinary business of play for the campaign, while for this one player it was a cataclysmic event, near betrayal by the GM. Us being adults this of course didn't devolve into much of an argument in that regard - the problem player certainly agrees in hindsight that the game is logical and does what the GM was intending it to from the start, even if it's not to his tastes.<br/><br/>We could maybe imagine how such incoherence could be withstood or even utilized as part of play, but it is a pretty distant dream to me - players would have to sacrifice the very elements of play they value the most merely to provide the same lukewarm opportunity for other players. I should know, I GMed an extensive 3-year playtest of "let's do all the CA together" 3rd ed.

It is the Campaign. The idea is that it is a bunch of players acting as their characters where their actions are adjudicated by a human referee in one or more linked sessions called a campaign.<br/><br/>What came first? It was the campaign, first Blackmoor and later Greyhawk. The rules of both campaigns were continually changing as Arneson and Gygax had to make rulings to handle what their players were doing. In fact we now know that the rules that Blackmoor used had little resemblance to the D&amp;D rules that came out of Greyhawk and that there was never a Blackmoor book of rules Arneson's players had.<br/><br/>So if not the rule what make Blackmoor, and Greyhawk so appealing? It was because Arneson and Gygax created a interesting, addictive, and above all fun experience for their players. And my own personal experience of running campaigns for over 35 years is that what makes them memorable are not the rules I used but the experiences I created. <br/><br/>So if you want to have a theory about RPGs then it needs to start with the Campaign not the rules or the design of the rules. And people are not going to like that, because rules are easier to judge objectively while Campaigns are far more subjective.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446447/#Comment_446447" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T13:31:07+00:00" title="July 14, 2015  1:31PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Yeah, assuming I understand GDNS Official, Canonical correctly, the type of old school D&amp;D we play around here would be Sim with a dash of Gam, I guess.

For instance, it's taken a long time for theorists to become personally interested in freeform play, or for freeformers to adapt Forgite theory, exactly because of this bias. It's definitely a fair cop, and fully understandable when one remembers that the Forge was an indie design and publishing think-tank, not just a theory clearings-house - most of the theorists were and are game designers and publishers, which obviously colors our interests.\n<blockquote>One player in my con games, not the home group, who's a lurker at these boards and a super sweet guy, described it as "I want to win, <em>but as Joane</em>" (his character's name).</blockquote>\nThis is exactly the way I describe our creative agenda as well; the victory being sought is one over the fictional circumstances, not over the largely arbitrary and constantly mutating rules framework - and certainly not against the other players at the table! I often use the "knight metaphor" to express it: given a brave knight riding out to defeat a dragon, we're interested in delving into how that might be possible for a man of steel against a beast of fire, not in how this particular combination of ill-thought mechanical feats gives me an insta-kill.<br/><br/>Ironically, and to further confuse people who aren't quite on board with the creative focus of GNS: one of the classic GNS-Sim flavours is the game with an intricate simulative rules system where the creative interest is maintained by learning to use and adapt the system in ever more intricate ways, seeing what it can do. GURPS and Ars Magica, for instance, suit this kind of Sim play well. We can say that the confusion of the layman is complete when we have "Gamism" without rules and "Simulationism" with intense min-maxing of a system to see what you can do with it <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446450/#Comment_446450" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T14:06:49+00:00" title="July 14, 2015  2:06PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2015 2:07PM by 2097.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, many GURPS fans enjoy that sort of play.<br/>To me GURPS is a shocking game where the players operate under carefully restricted (and technically detailed) circumstances, like putting together a swiss watch.

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I can imagine how frustrating that kind of false play would be, with the GM running illusions. My own GURPS experience is very limited, but I've been playing in an experienced friend's GURPS campaign that started last winter, and I have to say that it's been working for me - the game's rules system is surprisingly elegant and interesting for exactly this sort of tinkering (I'd never read the rules before!), and the GM is, as far as I can tell, entirely serious about using the rules - he's responsive about addressing any rules questions, has not ever suggested any sort of fiat, and regularly uses the players as consultants to make calculations and rules check-ups quicker. Where he wants to change the rules or interpret them in a non-standard way, we discuss it collectively.<br/><br/>I've been entertaining myself by training my kungfu monk character to kill cows with a single strike to the head, and as far as I can tell this has been just fine for the group, who do certainly assume that my character'll encounter a fierce death once he upgrades to killing dragons with the same technique. To me this way of playing GURPS has been quite clear GNS-Simulationism with princess play / dollhousing, GM-plotted adventuring, and watchmaking with the rules system. Relative to most games I play players are relatively passive and each tinker on their own clockwork projects, but that's just a fresh change of pace for me.<br/><br/>(Considering our actual topic in this series of GNS threads, I should note the amusing fact that the GM is in some sort of funny denial about the creative agenda of our GURPS campaign - he thinks that we're playing "challengeful old school D&amp;D with GURPS rules", which would frankly be fucking awkward with a rules system where creating a character takes 4 hours. This is not an actual problem because while the game's fictive genre is "dungeon fantasy" and it uses GURPS rules for, appropriately enough, "Dungeon Fantasy", the actual procedures of play are as far as I can discern entirely concordant with the GURPS rules, and therefore not at all the harsh survival struggle and gauging of risk that old school D&amp;D actually posits.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446454/#Comment_446454" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T14:21:03+00:00" title="July 14, 2015  2:21PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We really need a positive sounding term for Princess Play, because it is incredibly prevalent in my experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446455/#Comment_446455" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T14:29:56+00:00" title="July 14, 2015  2:29PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2015 2:33PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've actually been in the habit of adding a disclaimer whenever I call something "princess play", because you are correct in that people seem to interpret it negatively. I left it out earlier because it's such an off-topic detail, but here it is for those bothered by it:<br/><br/><i>The usage of the term "princess play" is not intended to be defamatory or belittling - it is at most a little humorous, but mostly just a reference to the idea that the popular childhood game of "playing princess" apparently features the same Creative Agenda. I enjoy princess play myself, and can't help but think that people who have trouble with the term might - just might - have some issues with the female gender.</i><br/><br/>Another related term I've used is "doll-housing", which captures a similar sort of Sim focus, except that you might be focusing less on the immaculate character vision and more on some slightly larger and conceptually dynamic idea, such as an entire covenant of mages in Ars Magica, a starship in a Star Trek game, or a trade caravan the PCs set up in a fantasy adventure game - basically the same, except for a slightly wider focus in community of characters instead of just one character as an isolated idea.<br/><br/>But I suppose doll houses are as girly as princesses (except for Castle Greyskull obviously, which is metal), so that doesn't help too much if girliness is to be considered defamatory <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Maybe "barbarian fantasy" or "paradigmatic daydreaming" would be more comfortable? I guess we have another one of these terminology things where nobody really likes the present term, but it's just difficult to overcome the inertia. Like, I've used "princess play" for almost a decade now, so it slips out pretty naturally if I don't think about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/robertsconley" title="robertsconley"><img alt="robertsconley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/robertsconley">robertsconley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446459/#Comment_446459" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T14:51:44+00:00" title="July 14, 2015  2:51PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Robert: I agree 100%, although I'd like to say that what you describe as the theoretical position gave way very early to an acknowledgement of the reality in the form of the Lumpley Principle in 2004 or so, which basically recast the entire theoretical construct so far (or "clarified" it, rather - I think nobody really thought otherwise earlier, it just wasn't thought about as much) in a new light by stating exactly what you said just now: the real system of play, and therefore the real determinants of creative success, lie in what is actually being performed at the gaming table, and not in the rules and advice that might be written in some game text.<br/></blockquote>\nWhat I getting at isn't the same as the Lumply Principle. The Campaign isn't about how the game is played or what is seen but rather it is the game itself. A campaign has a structure and various techniques are used to manage it. The rules are one of the tools used to manage a campaign. <br/><br/>A theory about RPGs would be a theory about the different types of Campaigns, what they are about, how they are organized and how they are managed. <br/><br/>One may ask why isn't all this part of the rules? Because Campaigns are not games in the traditional sense. The campaign is what sets RPGs apart from the wargame progenitors and the current crop of board games. While games focus on various types of play, campaigns present an experience that is hopefully interesting, challenging, and fun.  In short what Gygax and Arneson invented was a pen &amp; paper virtual reality or holodeck. <br/><br/>In my years of refereeing tabletop, managing LARP events, and even running MMORPGs servers (Neverwinter Nights), the point of it all isn't quite the same as playing a game, not quite the same as playing a sport, but rather to experience something as if you are there as the character you are playing. <br/><br/>Different types of roleplaying games exist because there are different ways of creating these experiences. The focus on creating experiences is what sets roleplaying games apart from other games. What sets tabletop roleplaying apart from other forms of roleplaying is the use of a human referee as the primary adjudicator.<br/><br/>All of this is organized as Campaign consisting of one or more inter-linked sessions.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446462/#Comment_446462" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T15:24:18+00:00" title="July 14, 2015  3:24PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So what you mean by Campaign is basically the accumulated traditions and tools of the game, and how those impact the proceedings of play over long term, as opposed to the more usual theoretical focus on the impact of momentary decisions and successful play on a per session basis.<br/><br/>Sure, I can get behind that as an important part of a full understanding of what roleplaying games do. I've certainly played a lot of campaign-form games myself over the last few years (first time in my life, as last decade I played mostly short to medium form, and before then my play was largely incoherent and thus unable to sustain long-term interest), and seen how the long-term existence of the campaign hones the practice.<br/><br/>However, I think that it would be unfair to say that the only worthwhile theory is the theory of campaign conduct. Roleplaying games fully recognizable as such at an intuitive level are played a lot in one-shot sessions as well, with fluid groups the composition of which changes from game to game. To me it's pretty obvious that campaign concerns are one of the possible dimensions of tools that come into play in a long-form project, but are irrelevant to more modest forms of play.<br/><br/>And if you're saying that Forgite theory has not historically produced many insights on long-form play, I would certainly agree with that. I don't think it's any basic fault in the theoretical chassis, as I believe the focus on Creative Agenda as the driving motivation of play to be solid, but it is there, perhaps because of the experimental design context in which the theory has been most intensely developed. I will not be surprised if we'll see more campaign-level theoretical insight over time as people apply theory to their play; one could see my own fiddling with D&amp;D in this light, for example, as I've explored orally transmitted system tradition and principles-driven play as a replacement for the rules-driven approach more prevalent in Forgite thinking.<br/><br/>That being said, I would be interested in reading it if anybody developed a rpg theory with some explanatory power that didn't elevate the creative payoffs of satisfying play into an explanatory position like GNS and similar theories do. I imagine a campaign theory concerned with "righful action", perhaps, in Confusian style, would be plain entertaining <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446464/#Comment_446464" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T15:48:29+00:00" title="July 14, 2015  3:48PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Robert, <br/><br/>Are you using "Campaign" here to refer to the collection of non-text rules, the agreements and mores, the shared appreciation of the material, and so on? If so, that's basically the Big Model's "Social Contract" layer, and there was a fair amount of discussion of it.<br/><br/>"System" in Big Model jargon, as Eero explained, is rules + all the stuff the players agree to (explicitly, implicitly, complicitly) as the set of Techniques to make a game happen. That is, however things get done at the table is the System.<br/><br/>But it sounds more like you mean that a Campaign is a series of interconnected game sessions. As I've played plenty of fun RPGs that were one-shots, I'm not sure that a theory of RPG play is incomplete without a Campaign component.

I am well aware that one-shots can be fun and interesting as multiple sessions. In my view a RPG Campaign is a RPG Campaign whether it is just one session or multiple.<br/><br/>When I talk about Campaign I mean one shots and a handful of inter-linked session as well.<br/>\n<blockquote>So what you mean by Campaign is basically the accumulated traditions and tools of the game, and how those impact the proceedings of play over long term, as opposed to the more usual theoretical focus on the impact of momentary decisions and successful play on a per session basis.</blockquote>\nA Campaign includes long term management and short term session management. There is no clear cut division over what works when. Some ideas clearly only apply to long term play, while others clearly only apply to what happens in a single session. Between these two poles there is a spectrum. <br/><br/>And the ultimate focus of all of these is to create and manage an experience for players playing as their character interacting with a imagined setting.<br/>\n<blockquote>I played mostly short to medium form, and before then my play was largely incoherent and thus unable to sustain long-term interest), and seen how the long-term existence of the campaign hones the practice.</blockquote>\nAnd so you know where I am coming from what I done for the past six years is<br/><br/>1) Continued running a weekly game set in my 30 year old Majestic Wilderland setting.<br/>2) Run one-shot adventures at game convention 3 to 4 times a year.<br/>3) Run a bi-monthly game-store with a random assortment of players sitting down at the day. This amount to 15 to 22 sessions a year.<br/><br/>All of this using a variety of system including FATE, GURPS, classic D&amp;D, D&amp;D 5th, Traveller, Hero System, etc.<br/><br/>This variety of experience has cemented my opinion is that what makes for a successful RPG are the ones that help run good campaigns (one-shot or longer) not the ones with the best rules.\n<blockquote>However, I think that it would be unfair to say that the only worthwhile theory is the theory of campaign conduct.

I am not focusing on long term play. What I am focusing is the idea that the DESIGN of the RULES is what important in making a useful RPG product. What I advocate instead is that the primary goal of a RPG Product is to be useful to a RPG Campaign (one-shot, short-run or long term).  That the design of the rule is like editing or art, important that you get it right but is not the primary goal. <br/>\n<blockquote>And if you're saying that Forgite theory has not historically produced many insights on long-form play, I would certainly agree with that. <br/></blockquote>\nMy view is that Forgite Theory is useless for insight on anything RPG related and is counter productive by focusing on the rules where the focus needs to be on the Campaign.

What is a good movie? Yeah we know it when we see one. But how do you go about deliberately making one? that is a much tougher question to answer. What we though is a 100 year body of techniques that various directors and producers have used to make films. There are some that almost everybody agrees you need to do but many other where in the hands of one director makes a great film, and in the hands of another makes for a shit film.<br/><br/>In my view, and this probably a radical viewpoint for most. Is that RPGs are about creating active experiences. It this manner it is unlike film, theater, novels or anything else. The closest things would be something like the people putting together travel experiences or high adventure trips.  The different is that RPGs have the wealth of human history, and imagination to draw from to craft the trip with.<br/><br/>There element of the more passive arts that could help with managing the experience of roleplaying. But it is really its own unique thing unlike any other form of entertainment out there at the moment. The Creative Agenda is too passive as it borrows too much from the arts which focus on creating works to be viewed after they are finished. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446468/#Comment_446468" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T16:39:53+00:00" title="July 14, 2015  4:39PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for clearing up what you meant.

As Vincent teaches, successful and cohesive play resides in actual practices executed by the players at the table, meaningful to them, in support of their own creative priorities. Rules in a rulebook are dead letters only meaningful when they succeed in transmitting ideas that may be adapted successfully by others at a later time in a different place. Often rules are presented as something for the whole group to execute, sometimes they are "advice" for the GM to improve their processes, and so on, but in all cases they will only impact play via the actions of one or more players; rule books do not speak and act by themselves.<br/><br/>Like Adam, I don't really see any disagreement here, so surely the kernel of the argument resides in relative emphasis and choice of terminology. Certainly everything you list as necessities of a real rpg theory (firm commitment to interactivity, independence from passive art forms, focus on human interactions at the table) is <i>exactly</i> the same position that the Forge took last decade against all comers. I don't see a problem in this; rather, it's nice to hear that others agree that the dynamic creative interaction at the game table is the key defining feature of roleplaying, and that the task of rpg theory is to explain and facilitate that <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446489/#Comment_446489" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T18:17:52+00:00" title="July 14, 2015  6:17PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Princess Play IS positive.

This still seems in line with the example I gave earlier. I don't see why the players would have to sacrifice their elements of play. <br/><br/>This brings to mind my games of D&amp;D I ran many years ago for a bunch of kids - mostly pre-teen girls. We also had a younger sister of one of the kids who played as well.  I'm pretty sure she was squarely in what you would call "princess play".  I had her play a mischievous fairy who went along with the party.  <br/><br/>While most of the party were being subjected to murderous skeletons and so forth, the fairy was largely immune.  She didn't contribute that much to help the party defeat their enemies, but she could be of help, and she was especially happy to comment about their efforts while they were being beaten down.  <br/><br/>As far as I could tell, the other players found her antics funny and a positive addition to play. I certainly did as GM.  She was also a semi-random wild card that could add complication to their plans, which they took as a challenge.  The main player who had a problem with her was her sister - which I think had more to do with out-of-game than in-game issues.  I don't feel like there was anything lost to the core of their play by having her play.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446531/#Comment_446531" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T21:11:30+00:00" title="July 14, 2015  9:11PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mainly the problem in running a princess player alongside hardcore survival gamists in old school D&amp;D is, speaking for myself, in that the players presumably wouldn't be comfortable with having the different rules and causality that it'd require applied to different players. I say "presumably" because I haven't really ever tried suggesting that to the players.<br/><br/>Also, the princess player's influence on the events would have be carefully curtailed. I once had a princess player in a game of old school D&amp;D with somewhat lax procedural rules, and the player utilized the opportunity to make their character a special snowflake (the old demonic familiar/girlfriend of the wizard guy whose abandoned lair the party was investigating, if memory serves) who then proceeded to basically play against the party in a wild, unheeding fashion before disappearing laughing into the dungeon. It wasn't a massive social breakdown, but it was peculiar, and served nothing in terms of rising to challenge, even if it was very good for allowing that player to feel special and in narrative control. Most of the difficulties in that session were caused by that player instead of the scenario, and it could have gone much worse, had I been even slightly less careful methodologically.<br/><br/>The fundamental issue underlying the practicalities would be that princess play implies a certain degree of plot immunity and plot <i>impact</i> (it doesn't have to be fresh and authentic and free as per Narrativism or whatever, but the character's gotta be important to the proceedings), which is anathema to this type of gamist play in so many ways. If the princess character is on the side of the party then it's an unfair advantage, if it's against the party it's an unfair challenge (can't just bash their face in for it to be a princess character), and either way it cheapens the blood and tears others have to pay to achieve and enjoy a similar fictional positioning.<br/><br/>To me that's all classical GNS clash stuff, of course. Your example shows that it's possible to not mind it either, which arguably goes to show that in certain circumstances incoherent play can be functional. (That was what we were discussing, right - one gets confused with these meandering conversations...)<br/><br/>Let me throw out a fresh theory hypothesis for a change: the reason for why incoherent play is often dissatisfying should, considering the definition of coherence, lie in the lack of genuinely meaningful creative interaction between the players. It stands to reason, then, that it should be possible to maintain functional yet incoherent play reliably by including players whose sole task in the interaction is to moderate and provide meaningful interfaces for the different CAs at the table. The GM could, for example, view their own role as merely facilitating, so that they get their social rewards from entertaining the players.<br/><br/>The above occurs to me because of the way I imagine you, John, running a game for the teenagers and putting up with the young fairy. When I'm in that situation myself, I am often in something of an entertaining mood - I'm not seeking to achieve much creatively myself in that game, but I am attempting to make sure that the youngsters have a good time and are left with a good impression of the hobby. I can imagine how I <i>could</i> juggle a princess faction and a real play faction to some degree in that kind of situation, especially if I could establish a socially acceptable reason for the gamists to accept the princesses - an age difference is of course excellent in that regard, as everybody knows who's had to give special consideration to young children to make them feel included in something or other.<br/><br/>For a slightly more general take one could put in a game text, maybe a fantasy game or such could have character classes that are clearly divided between the real man's challenging options and the fairy princess alternative. This way players could genuinely make overt, agreed upon choices about whether they're interested in struggling or playing princess, and nobody would need to feel that another player is "getting away" with something. The two types of characters could then interact by e.g. having the fairy princesses be patrons and companions and so on for the wretched adventurer figures, basically NPCs from the viewpoint of the Gamist faction at the table.<br/><br/>From a Big Model viewpoint the GM is a crucial participant in this sort of set-up, because theirs is the responsibility of providing a meaningful sounding board for both types of players; they cannot really do it for each other, assuming that they're seriously achieving their own Creative Agenda. I guess one would need to try out this game idea to see if the Creative Agendas would meld, if one would drive out the other, or if they would remain separate, and whether play would be fun and meaningful regardless.<br/><br/>(If the above reminds one of Ars Magica with its companions and grogs, well, it's not like I haven't thought about that game's complex Creative Agenda assumptions.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446541/#Comment_446541" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T21:45:27+00:00" title="July 14, 2015  9:45PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>For what it's worth, in my head Vincent is a "Forgite theorist"</blockquote>Certainly.

If I remember the essay correctly, though, Ron used "hardcore" to mean gamism in which social stakes are on the line. I'd like to think that we're a pretty friendly bunch and totally don't mind it if players play badly as long as they don't play wrong, if you know what I mean. I'm somewhat infamous myself for having rather high casualty rates for my characters, that's just the way I roll <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>We are totally hardcore (well, the hard core of the crew is) in the more casual sense - the Agenda is sharp, we play seriously, criticize performance incisively, and focus on play when we play. I suppose that <i>maybe</i> we might be just a bit more hardcore in the social stakes sense as well than some other group, but nowhere near the levels of those assholes at the local gaming store who'll say nasty things to you if you don't have your own rulebook and know the spell list by heart.<br/><br/>But be that here or there, I certainly agree with you about hardcore being rare, whether one means Ron's concept or more casual use of the term. I definitely agree that not only are people usually pretty flexible about what they'll play and how, but that flexibility might also help in working out some sort of agenda compromise, assuming such would be possible without fundamentally undermining all desires.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446573/#Comment_446573" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-15T00:56:43+00:00" title="July 15, 2015 12:56AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 15, 2015 12:56AM by komradebob.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was decidedly more using the terms in the casual sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446579/#Comment_446579" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-15T03:18:58+00:00" title="July 15, 2015  3:18AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 15, 2015 3:25AM by Paul_T.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It strikes me that the "princess play" example John just brought up (and Eero's response) strikes to the heart of one of the <b>main objections I see</b> to Forge theory. Over and over again. <br/><br/>Perhaps it's at the heart of everything we've got going on in this debate.<br/><br/>Ok, the princess girl game:<br/><br/>I can also imagine playing in that game, with one girl playing a different kind of character, and engaging with the game in a different way than the others.<br/><br/>So what's going on there?<br/><br/>Clearly the "theory" stance is that there is an element of incoherence there, but the people playing are also clearly enjoying themselves. (Never mind that this doesn't *contradict* the theory - incoherent and fun play is certainly possible within it, no problem there.)<br/><br/>On one side we have people saying:<br/><br/>Clearly our game is fine, and we're having a good time. We'd maybe even have LESS of a good time if that girl tried to play like the others, because she'd be conforming to the group instead of bringing in her own unique flavour. <br/><br/>Here's John's take:\n<blockquote><br/>While most of the party were being subjected to murderous skeletons and so forth, the fairy was largely immune.  She didn't contribute that much to help the party defeat their enemies, but she could be of help, and she was especially happy to comment about their efforts while they were being beaten down.  <br/><br/>As far as I could tell, the other players found her antics funny and a positive addition to play. I certainly did as GM.  She was also a semi-random wild card that could add complication to their plans, which they took as a challenge.  [...] I don't feel like there was anything lost to the core of their play by having her play.  </blockquote>\nIt sounds like this mixed playstyle was actually <i>enhancing</i> the game, and everyone was having a good time. Clearly functional and enjoyable! (Some people have gone so far as to say that the mixed playstyle is the POINT of roleplaying, or the spice which makes it interesting and different from other media.)<br/><br/>From this perspective, what's the point of Creative Agenda (and does it exist at all)? <br/><br/>Just playing well together and supporting each others' input seems like the key to good gaming.<br/><br/>One way this is often presented is that the goal of playing a roleplaying game is to have fun, goof off, be creative, exercise your brain, make friends, and so forth. (For this, some kind of Social agenda is really being expressed, as well as possibly some kind of Technical preferences being fulfilled.)<br/><br/>I don't know if that's actually your position, John, but you hinted at something like this earlier when you said that you can't see people actually playing an RPG with a Creative Agenda in mind, when it seems to you that we play games for more basic payoffs, like relaxing, blowing off steam, making friends, and so on.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>On the other side, we have the Forgite view. Eero, if you don't mind, I'll quote you for a second:<br/><br/>(Aside: I'm not trying to put words in your mouths, Eero and John. If you don't feel you represent these points of view, that's fine - it's just that this exchange here is a good example of the kind of argument I've seen over this point by other people.)<br/>\n<blockquote>The reason for why I was speculating about having the GM carry the creative load of meshing the game together is that I can't picture the creative passion/enjoyment in facilitating the other guy's insipid concerns <i>while</i> also trying to play your own game with passion. I can imagine the GM sacrificing their own creative enjoyment to herd cats, because that's so similar to what the traditional GM role advocates anyway, but it does assume that the player in question remains relatively creatively inert themselves.<br/></blockquote>\nFrom this other angle, the highest aspiration of roleplaying gaming is some kind of creative goal, and in playing we get to engage our artistic sensibilities and try to do so as well as possible.<br/><br/>(For instance, in a competitive, Step On Up game, the artistry of your ability to manipulate the system of the game to defeat your opposition or out-compete your competition is what is ultimately being tested. Are you a chess master? Etc.)<br/><br/>Of course you can't fulfill this kind of agenda when you have to also worry about coordinating the input of several other players, satisfying their personal whims in terms of what they want to see in the game, and so forth. It's better to get everyone on the same page, by playing the right game with the right people, and staying focused on the creative goals we're all striving towards.<br/><br/>A player who doesn't strive for that goal doesn't necessarily ruin the game or make it un-fun, but, at best, their input is a distraction from it. Ideally, every contributing member is doing something to make the whole thing better, elevate it, and interacting with our input (not off doing their own, tangentially-related thing).<br/><br/>It's like playing chess against a person who doesn't really care about making the best moves they can: it's not necessarily un-fun - it might still be enjoyable and you might still learn something - but for future games you'd probably *prefer* to play with someone who challenges you.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>The first type of person plays a game and says, "Hey, was that fun? Did we enjoy ourselves? Cool." And that's the end of that.<br/><br/>The second type is saying, "Well, that might have been enjoyable enough, but it's not my peak experience."<br/><br/>In other words, I can enjoy playing with the girl and her princess character and have a good time.<br/><br/>But if I imagine playing with that group on a regular basis, my sense is that those sessions which really stand out in my memory - the ones where people cried or high-fived each other, the ones we still talk about years later - well, in those sessions, something different happened. Maybe that girl got sucked in to the game the others were playing for that evening, and we were suddenly all on the same page. Or maybe the others became invested in her character's storyline. Whatever way, everyone was really, really engaged in a specific endeavour. Like when you read a book and you forget that you're reading a book because you're so engrossed in the story.<br/><br/>Imagine an immersionist LARPer from Norway (stereotypes, yeah!). They want to spend the game sitting in a closet and crying; they want to experience something transformative.<br/><br/>Will they invite someone who doesn't really buy into that premise to join in on the game? Probably not, just like you wouldn't invite your casual chess buddy to your highly competitive chess tournament, because that's not their thing.<br/><br/>I'm thinking that this debate is one I've seen a LOT. (For instance, between Vincent Baker and Zak Sabbath, or whatever his name is - the D&amp;D with Pornstars fellow.)<br/><br/>Anyone else seeing the same thing I'm seeing?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446580/#Comment_446580" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-15T03:20:58+00:00" title="July 15, 2015  3:20AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 15, 2015 3:21AM by Paul_T.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (accidental double post)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446592/#Comment_446592" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-15T06:22:23+00:00" title="July 15, 2015  6:22AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Let me throw out a fresh theory hypothesis for a change: the reason for why incoherent play is often dissatisfying should, considering the definition of coherence, lie in the lack of genuinely meaningful creative interaction between the players. It stands to reason, then, that it should be possible to maintain functional yet incoherent play reliably by including players whose sole task in the interaction is to moderate and provide meaningful interfaces for the different CAs at the table. The GM could, for example, view their own role as merely facilitating, so that they get their social rewards from entertaining the players.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>From a Big Model viewpoint the GM is a crucial participant in this sort of set-up, because theirs is the responsibility of providing a meaningful sounding board for both types of players; they cannot really do it for each other, assuming that they're seriously achieving their own Creative Agenda. I guess one would need to try out this game idea to see if the Creative Agendas would meld, if one would drive out the other, or if they would remain separate, and whether play would be fun and meaningful regardless.</blockquote>\nI had a lot of fun GMing those games, though I certainly did view myself as facilitating - so I think it could be fair to say that my rewards were mostly social.  Being in it mainly for social reward is true for a lot of players and GMs, though. <br/><br/>Still, I'm not convinced that a purely dedicated facilitator is necessary.  As a player, I can do one thing, and still give positive feedback to someone else for doing something different.  Within the game, I observed the other players smiling and having fun interacting with the little sister's fairy.  <br/><br/>To clarify, <br/><br/>1) Some people may have a preference that everyone at the table putting priority on the same agenda - such as everyone concentrating on tactics and doing what is optimal.  That is a perfectly reasonable preference. <br/><br/>2) However, there are many cases where people support each other having different priorities, such as enjoying having a wild card that you have to deal with in your tactics - or conversely having no-nonsense mortals for your fairy to mess with.  <br/><br/>3) Hence, I think that the idea that incoherence leads to less fun doesn't hold up. That part is mentioned in the GNS essays, but it can be seen as non-central to the theory. <br/><br/>(Keep in mind that this isn't the only argument against the Big Model, though.)                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446630/#Comment_446630" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-15T15:05:51+00:00" title="July 15, 2015  3:05PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 15, 2015 3:29PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I can't picture the creative passion/enjoyment in facilitating the other guy's insipid concerns <i>while</i> also trying to play your own game with passion.</blockquote>I think it's primarily GNS theory (plus much play history from people/groups with larger social problems) that tells us that two people with different primary concerns will view each other's as insipid.  In real life, at least some of the time, we can take turns finding the fun in each other's disparate play emphases.  With adults who are friends* playing together in the spirit of cooperation, I don't think this is even that difficult.  The difficult part is finding a creative configuration that supports disparate concerns in the mechanics and fiction, so that (e.g.) I can effectively bring my enthusiasm for genre emulation into play for you to feed off, and you can effectively bring your enthusiasm for puzzle-solving for me to feed off.  (This is why I'm excited about configurations like fairy princess as patron or constraint for strategic adventurers.)<br/><br/>Note: I'm not arguing that this sort of play is the same, or just as as good, as play with a united creative direction; I'm just arguing for it on its own merits.

It's the great communication abyss of standards and taste, and trust in reporting.  <br/><br/>Are the folks on the internet who say, "My game has been super frustrating, but we keep playing," brain-damaged masochists who've been sucked into a compulsive cycle of despair, or are they just awesome gamers having an awesome time with a few major gripes they want to write about?<br/><br/>Are the folks on the internet who say, "My game has been super amazing, greatly rewarding and fulfilling on a deep level, way better than the play I used to have before I Solved Roleplaying and left behind all that stuff everyone else does, which I now think is garbage," true beacons of amazing new experiences we can all achieve with the correct practice, or just self-aggrandizing braggarts who go through the same highs and not-so-highs as most gamers?<br/><br/>Or, yet another option, are both types of play truly, deeply, different, but with no hierarchy, just a matter of taste?<br/><br/>Hmm.  Should this be its own thread?  The reality behind the reporting, I mean; not the reporting itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446634/#Comment_446634" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-15T15:24:31+00:00" title="July 15, 2015  3:24PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hahaha guilty as charged to making the sort of statements that the other true beacons make about their new shiny ways!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446637/#Comment_446637" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-15T15:33:13+00:00" title="July 15, 2015  3:33PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nah, your sense of humor and disinclination to crow about how your current play is better than everyone else's makes all the difference.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446656/#Comment_446656" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-15T18:32:53+00:00" title="July 15, 2015  6:32PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave:<br/><br/>Yeah, exactly!

Now a trip is more focused with specific destinations in mind so it not quite analogous. In the case of tabletop roleplaying the focus is to go on adventures (or a adventure in the case of a one-shot) in the setting of the campaign. <br/><br/>It will work provided that the personalities of everybody involves meshes. Although to outsiders how it played out could be nonseniscal. To use the example of the girl playing the fairy character, if the party like the roleplaying of her character it may not matter that the character is utterly useless to the completion of the goals of the party. As long as the character is not actively hindering what the other players want to do, the other players may (and often do in my experience) find it add a lot of flavor and color.<br/><br/>And also in my experience that same fairy could be a source of great annoyance depending on the player's personality and/or how they roleplay their character.<br/><br/>GNS/Big Model attempts to address from the viewpoint that the participants are creating a collaborative work.

There has been some writing on different kinds of fun for different games. These have been analyzed more in computer games, with labels like Fiero for the hard fun of overcoming obstacles, and so forth. My point wasn't that creative goals don't exist, but that creative goals have a reward in real-world emotions - personal satisfaction, emotional catharsis, ego boost, and so forth. <br/><br/>Ideally, I would like to get to a theory that isn't tied to particular identity politics, and doesn't mandate what the highest aspiration of a roleplaying game is. <br/>\n<blockquote>In other words, I can enjoy playing with the girl and her princess character and have a good time.<br/><br/>But if I imagine playing with that group on a regular basis, my sense is that those sessions which really stand out in my memory - the ones where people cried or high-fived each other, the ones we still talk about years later - well, in those sessions, something different happened. Maybe that girl got sucked in to the game the others were playing for that evening, and we were suddenly all on the same page. Or maybe the others became invested in her character's storyline. Whatever way, everyone was really, really engaged in a specific endeavour. Like when you read a book and you forget that you're reading a book because you're so engrossed in the story.<br/><br/>Imagine an immersionist LARPer from Norway (stereotypes, yeah!). They want to spend the game sitting in a closet and crying; they want to experience something transformative.</blockquote>\nOK, so maybe your enjoyment is built around something like a sense of camaraderie - the feeling that everyone at the table is working together towards a common goal. I would thoroughly accept this. <br/><br/>However, your description doesn't match with my experience. A lot of the most memorable sessions for me have been sessions like this one with the mischievous fairy (Note: she wasn't a fairy princess, though I cited it as fitting Eero's term "princess play"). It was great fun where everyone got to shine in different ways. <br/><br/>As an alternate example, there was a GURPS Space game in college where I was the only really competitive player among the four. We were playing a group of genetically-engineered "siblings" manipulated into being superspies. The other players were more reactive, happy to see where the plot lead them - while I played my character, Cain, as fanatically pro-active. I had a great time running myself ragged trying to take on overwhelming force, while riding herd on the others. Meanwhile, they enjoyed dealing with me running myself ragged. <br/><br/>My most memorable gamist experiences - like this - aren't necessarily when everyone at the table is trying to do the same thing, but instead are often when I had my chance to shine in taking on a challenge as a counterpoint to other, non-gamist points.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446680/#Comment_446680" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-15T22:07:27+00:00" title="July 15, 2015 10:07PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great post, John.<br/><br/>I wonder if others would agree that the Big Model fails to address that kind of enjoyment in gaming?

Ron and Eero both use core descriptors like "dream" and "daydream", and Eero uses "idle curiousity"  -  while they don't use these terms for narrativism.  It carries the implication that simulationism is just daydreaming, while narrativism is real - not just idle - when they're both equally imaginary and idle. <br/><br/>As far as Social Agenda and Technical Agenda, while there were a few threads asking about them - they were never covered in depth, and were generally treated as if they were unimportant, and haven't been detailed in essays or the wiki.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446695/#Comment_446695" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-16T11:40:11+00:00" title="July 16, 2015 11:40AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't speak for Ron (although I suspect that he would agree), but it is a grievous misunderstanding if someone thinks that I am somehow anti-simulationist. My choice of words attempts to convey the nature of Simulationism the way I've experienced it myself, and is not intended to be disparaging. I don't know where John gets the notion that Sim would be somehow less "real" than the Narrativist soap opera antics.<br/><br/>This, of course, has a long and glorious history: for some reason many people seem to feel that Sim is often described "wrong". It is unfortunate that these same people generally consider this a reason for the theory to be invalid, and therefore do not attempt to explain the psychology of Sim better. Something of a catch there.<br/><br/>The reason for why I used the descriptor "idle" in relation to Sim is that to me the strongest, most compelling experience of Sim occurs in relatively loose creative settings, with strong self-direction and the freedom to pace and focus as we would as players. I have the intuitive feeling that this kind of interest would wither and die were it to be harnessed into a rigorous and limiting mechanical procedure, or a constraining GM's railroad. For example, I've been enjoying GURPS a lot this last spring, but that enjoyment has been contingent on the fact that the game allows me to spend a lot of time reading rulebooks and planning character development - it leaves plentiful idle time for the imagination to work in leisure, which to me seems like a necessity for caring about the mechanical nuances of GURPS. I'm not going to bother with them, frankly, if the game is constantly in my face about scenes and plot and adventure - GURPS needs to treat the player character as something of a static idea, with no time pressures for the character to be endangered and changed by outside forces and so on.<br/><br/>Of course not all Sim is "idle" in the sense of leisurely, but that word happened to be my best stab at dressing up my Sim insight into words in English: Sim is driven by curiousity, and it's a curiousity of a daydreaming type, directed not functionally at fulfilling some external purpose, but rather being a purpose in itself. When I play <i>Dead of Night</i> (a favourite Sim horror one-shot game) it's more tense than leisurely, but the creative agenda still derives from curiousity turned towards the aesthetic ephemeral, rather than from any sort of external goals; we're literally just playing to set up and experience a horror story, driven by the GM's curiousity at stuff like "can I make an invisible elephant work as a movie monster" or "witch covens are sexy and evil, and I'm going to show you how".<br/><br/>In summation, I wouldn't recommend drawing too strong conclusions about inherent biases from the sort of reasoning generally used for establishing the anti-Sim leanings of the Forge. What that argument basically amounts to is "I don't like your word choice, but won't suggest better", and "15 years ago when you knew much less about stuff, you said some thing in the Internet". Those are both pretty flimsy basis for judgment, and e.g. my recent stab at describing Sim concisely certainly was not intended to withstand hostile scrutiny for possible secret agenda.<br/><br/>Regarding Social Agenda and Technical Agenda, those have generally been acknowledged as things more or less well defined (although I would consider calling the latter "Technical Agenda" a mistake prone to confusion - not like that's not a theme with Forge theory terminology, of course), but theory-wise they've been somewhat slow to bear practical fruit. I don't think that this can be characterized as a failure of people who haven't produced results on them; if you can blame e.g. Ron for not developing a revolutionary theory of Social Agenda in between doing the things he find interesting to work on, you surely can blame yourself for the same failure as well <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446698/#Comment_446698" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-16T12:18:55+00:00" title="July 16, 2015 12:18PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The word choice issue isn't <i>just</i> that the terms used for Right to Dream have connotations of lower importance, lesser gravity and lesser "reality" than the terms used for Story Now.<br/>It's also that if you strip away that semantically connotational veneer, the difference between the two agendas becomes hard to see.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446699/#Comment_446699" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-16T12:48:53+00:00" title="July 16, 2015 12:48PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a fair issue to have, I agree!<br/><br/>I personally feel that Narrativism is explained pretty clearly (and accurately) by the Egri-influenced drama theory Ron outlines in his narrativism essay. I at least get a clearly distinctive concept of dramatic premise, how stories function psychologically and what, exactly, is the relationship of the Narrativist gamer to the story content of play. I would say that after reading that one essay my effectiveness as a Narrativist gaming operative increased by a magnitude, simply because it was so effortless to take a given game text and recognize the operative bits - <i>here</i>'s the premise, <i>here</i>'s the protagonist in struggle, <i>here</i>'s how this game proposes to confront the protagonist, <i>here</i>'s how an individual player makes premise-addressing choices, <i>here'</i>s how the game enables us to examine and enjoy the resultant theme...<br/><br/>It is admittedly not ideal that Simulationism does not as of yet have a similarly clearly phrased, positively defined and comprehensive description/theory of its internals. I see it as an entirely rational critique of GNS to cast suspicion upon the actual validity of the concept of "Sim" as this is the case. I feel that what we do have (mostly some vague descriptions and an exclusionary framework for where to look for it) is enough for me to perceive that Sim exists and recognize it when I experience it, but that took me some work (like, a couple of years of paying attention while playing various games last decade), and evidently experiental understanding is not as useful as a clear theoretical model would be.<br/><br/>As an interesting comparison, I feel that Gamism is about as clear as Narrativism, despite not having a Ron-provided internal theoretical model to work off; this is probably because I'm well familiar with Lajos Egri and aware of the various evolution biology ideas regarding play and competition as societal adaptations in humans and other such social animals. I've never had to discuss it in length with anybody, really (I assume because everybody is either on board with it, or don't understand Creative Agenda well enough to debate it on this level), but it's been easy for me to assume that Gamism is about as trivial to perceive, understand and acknowledge as Narrativism in the light of Egrite premise is.<br/><br/>Hmm, that should probably go on some to-do list, a solid internal theory of Simulationism. I can remember thinking about this about a decade back, but I didn't have nearly enough functional, fun and focused Sim experience then to consider figuring it out myself. Things could well be different today, or in the future; while my Sim gaming has not enjoyed the explosive growth that Gam's seen with the introduction of old school D&amp;D in my gaming oeuvre, it has been there as a low-level occasional activity, and could perhaps take center stage at some point...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446700/#Comment_446700" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-16T12:52:10+00:00" title="July 16, 2015 12:52PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Hmm, that should probably go on some to-do list, a solid internal theory of Simulationism.</blockquote>\nThat might run the risk of the tail wagging the puppy.

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not for me it doesn't, because I have first-hand empirical experience of the thing I would be describing. It's not that I only know of Simulationism from Ron claiming that it exists, it's that I don't have a particularly intricate analytical understanding of it. "Idle curiousity natural to a healthy imagination" is the closest I get right now when describing what it feels like to be utterly invested in figuring out e.g. how to build flying boats in Ars Magica.<br/><br/>If somebody were to decide to speculate upon the nature of Simulationism without being able to tease apart "Creative Agenda" from the turmoil of their impressions, and without having experienced something that very likely is this Simulationism that people are talking about, then I would agree that it would be highly likely that their speculative theoretizing upon the matter would largely conform to their preconceptions. Of course mere introspection is not the firmest ground possible when trying to avoid that, but at least it's something. For instance, it is conceivable that I stumble upon a coherent Creative Agenda at some point that truly straddles the Nar/Sim divide, and manage to not discard this knowledge due to preconceptions, which would enable me to abandon the GNS framework; this is not possible for somebody who engages in the theoretical framework as merely a verbal exercise.<br/><br/>In general it tends to be the case in my observation that people who disbelieve in GNS theory do not have any first-hand experiences that they recognize as GNS-like, while people who do find GNS credible tend to have had such experiences. It is, of course, difficult to figure out whether this chasm in personal perspective is more due to ignorance on part of the naysayer (insufficient training to recognize and analyze Creative Agenda for themselves so as to be able to speak to their experiences with confidence) or entrenched preconceptions on the part of the GNS apologist (after spending enough time in Ron's cult, everything starts to look like a Creative Agenda to you, making you think that you've "cracked the code") <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446705/#Comment_446705" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-16T14:05:51+00:00" title="July 16, 2015  2:05PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh, the conversation about Sim reminds me of one of my early criticisms of GNS, which amounted to: This isn't a Theory, this is a Manifesto ( or at least a Call to Action).<br/><br/>I'm talking about the fine points of the theory at this point, so much as my reaction to it, mind you.<br/><br/>If I could sum up what my take away was from it, it would probably go like this:<br/><br/><i>Gamism is good if it's hygienic ( if I understand how Eero uses the term), and early RPG play was hygienic Gamism. But then it became unhygienic rapidly. It became all sorts of things, various forms of Sim (Right to Dream). Now, one strain of that, something that seemed like people were looking for, was interpersonal character drama. If we take that strain and make it hygienic ( through mechanics) we can identify it and build to it, rather than doing it ad hoc by using unfit rules/mechanics and ignoring Gamist rules/methods in the texts we're buying/building. That isolated strain  centered on character drama/tough moral choices to show character, is Narrativism.<br/><br/>Good Lord people, let's just do it! How can we isolate that strain!?<br/><br/>Oh, and by the way, Gamism is still good. Let's look back at that and make it hygienic once again, mechanically and in terms of play culture.<br/><br/>As for the rest of it? All the unhygienic play? Fuck it. Players like it or don't. They'll figure it out or they won't. My interest is Narratvism, so come join me in my struggle to make it good and identifiable mechanically. We shall call all of that other stuff mish-mash of unhygienic play Simulationism.</i><br/><br/>With that as my understanding,  was really okay with it.<br/><br/>As for Sim itself, it's largely in the realm of majority play culture within the RPG hobby as it existed in the 1990s, and to a large extent today. Hobbyists in general seem most comfortable taking stuff that is essentially, at its core, gamist supporting mechanics, and then by non-mechanical means transforming by way of method into Sim supporting play.<br/><br/>I do think Ron, for as much as he didn't care about Sim initially ( too busy making arguments for the creation of a hygienic strain of play [Narr] and reminding people of the joys of earlier hygienic Gamism), eventually hit on something really important.<br/><br/><b>Sim isn't<i> just</i> Right to Dream. It's more than that. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It's about the celebration of source material.</span><br/></b><br/>Now that celebration aspect can take the form of imitative play, but it can also be parody and subversion of the source material. But you need to have a love of the source material, shared by the group as a whole, to parody or subvert the thing.<br/><br/>So I do think there is a place for exploration of Sim, in terms of mechanics and methodology. I think sometimes people have already hit it, although there's usually a tendency among both dirty-hippy gamers and mainstream gamers to tag the stuff as Narrativist when it does occur ( either as a compliment or as an insult). Certainly some of the techniques used in Narr games pairs well with Sim, but then we have noted that technical agenda and creative agenda are not the same.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446716/#Comment_446716" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-16T15:43:23+00:00" title="July 16, 2015  3:43PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The word choice issue isn't <i>just</i> that the terms used for Right to Dream have connotations of lower importance, lesser gravity and lesser "reality" than the terms used for Story Now.<br/>It's also that if you strip away that semantically connotational veneer, the difference between the two agendas becomes hard to see.</blockquote>\nI agree completely. The language gloss of "dream" versus "story" is essential to the definitions. <br/>\n<blockquote>Of course not all Sim is "idle" in the sense of leisurely, but that word happened to be my best stab at dressing up my Sim insight into words in English: Sim is driven by curiousity, and it's a curiousity of a daydreaming type, directed not functionally at fulfilling some external purpose, but rather being a purpose in itself. When I play <i>Dead of Night</i> (a favourite Sim horror one-shot game) it's more tense than leisurely, but the creative agenda still derives from curiousity turned towards the aesthetic ephemeral, rather than from any sort of external goals; we're literally just playing to set up and experience a horror story, driven by the GM's curiousity at stuff like "can I make an invisible elephant work as a movie monster" or "witch covens are sexy and evil, and I'm going to show you how".</blockquote>\nYou refer to "external purpose" here, but I don't see that there is an external purpose in narrativism. So, for example, from my experience of <i>Dead of Night</i> and <i>Sorcerer</i>, they're both just different takes on horror stories. <br/><br/>i.e. Sim: "just playing to set up and experience a horror story"<br/><br/>Nar: "just playing to set up and experience a horror story using Lajos Egri principles"<br/><br/>I enjoyed Sorcerer - but it doesn't accomplish an external purpose. A daydream that fits the principles of Lajos Egri is still just a daydream. I would agree that addressing moral/ethical issues makes great material for games. It helps build emotional involvement, whereas <i>Dead of Night</i> is more emotionally detached in it's approach. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446718/#Comment_446718" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-16T15:50:26+00:00" title="July 16, 2015  3:50PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2015 3:56PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am curious: does anyone here see anything particularly in favor of Simulationism as a category?  <br/><br/>I see a murky pit that may or may not encompass or emphasize celebration, resilience, constructive denial, just roleplaying, running a simulation, daydreaming, passive thrill rides, exploration, obsessions with rules modeling physics, and more.<br/><br/>To me it makes more sense to either:<br/><br/>1) Observe coherent play that isn't Gamist or Narrativist without labeling it beyond "not G or N", or:<br/><br/>2) Chop the grab bag I listed above up into several more meaningful and recognizable units.<br/><br/>Number two seems like a lot of work.

Insofar as Simulationism has something similar in the way of purpose, it's "celebrating the source material" as was suggested earlier - although I would rather call it "exploring" or "experiencing" or "handling" the source material: basically the Simulationistic reason to get together and imagine some shit up is because we're curious about this particular shit, while this is not the primary determinant for Narrativism. This is what I meant by Narrativism having an external purpose in contrast to Simulationism: it suffices for Simulationistic purposes that an airship is cool and let's talk some more about how cool our airship is; for Narrativism this sort of thing is at most pacing and build-up for what the airship will be used for, story-wise.<br/><br/>That being said, I'm certain that John has heard all this before in so many ways, not likely to convince him if I say it once more <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Regarding Sim as a category, I'm not wedded to it, and not probably many are. The reason for why you don't see many Forgite theorists willing to throw it overboard just like that is basically that it's our best guess of the moment, and we'd rather have something more convincing to replace it with before forgetting about it. That could take the form of new Creative Agenda modes or a convincing explanation for how many creative agendas are unmoded, and have been falsely assigned to what proves to be an imaginary mode. Something like that, backed with credible observations about real play.<br/><br/>In practical terms you don't see me talking about GNS outside these sorts of theory review discussions anyway. For example, when writing about my recent D&amp;D play I've just been calling it "challenge-oriented", and described the Creative Agenda in detailed practical terms. People who grok GNS won't have difficulty figuring out that we're talking about Gamism, and people who don't care or can't swallow that won't get sidetracked into the infinitely important and enchanting discussion of "pin a label on Eero's creative agenda".<br/><br/>The sense I get is that most others with a Forgite theory background are handling this much the same - you either abandon the theory, or you actualize it to your satisfaction, and either way you don't really have any need to push it in everyday conversation. From this perspective it would be entirely fair to say that whatever whoever thinks about Simulationism doesn't matter at all, as nobody as far as I understand really has a reason to push their perspective on it at others anyway. The most legit argument for reform motivation I've heard is that people get annoyed with all those theory smarts being wasted on the wrong theory, which isn't that compelling a call to action when you think about it <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446775/#Comment_446775" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-16T18:27:10+00:00" title="July 16, 2015  6:27PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2015 6:34PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, how about this as a more legit argument for reform:<br/><br/>The conceptual unit of Gamism can serve to relate a large body of potential design and play concerns to a given game without spelling everything out from scratch.<br/><br/>Ditto Narr.<br/><br/>Not so much Sim.<br/><br/>Wouldn't it be nice if you could say, "I'm working on an HSM ('Handling Source Material' to use your phrasing above) game, and I'm looking to solve X and improve Y," and your readers could call upon some body of known pertinent issues (like how balance/crunch/resource attrition and refreshment/action order/etc. often pertain to Gamism), such that they can apply perspectives beyond the specifics of your own reporting?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446777/#Comment_446777" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-16T18:34:32+00:00" title="July 16, 2015  6:34PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2015 6:57PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I mean, have you ever seen a thread on Story Games that went, "Hey, looking for ideas on how to celebrate and explore Indiana Jones crossed with Lovecraft using A-Team tac squads, any help?", "Sure, here are my insights from playing games of that sort!"?  Ever?<br/><br/>I haven't.  <br/><br/>I've seen plenty of "I wanna do Indiana Jones!"-type threads, but it's never clear whether that's a creative agenda or just color, and I've never seen replies discussing how to support the agenda.<br/><br/>I don't think calling such play "HSM" would suddenly fix that, but I do think that having a coherent theoretical category would allow such a category to accrue useful meaning and associations over time the way Gamism and Narrativism have done.<br/><br/>I also think that having a category defined as, "No, this <i>is</i> about celebrating/exploring/handling source material; not <i>maybe</i>, not <i>sometimes</i>, not <i>depending on how you phrase it</i>," would nicely forestall miscommunications.  It'd be obvious that you and (e.g.) the person whose agenda is to immerse in virtual experience are talking about different things.  It'd be obvious that constructive denial (for those who don't know: players pretending really hard that the source material rather than the play group is acting as the arbiter of creative constraints on 'what can and cannot enter play') is a tool rather than a fundamental feature.  It'd be obvious that your source material must be accessible, in players' awareness for comparison, inspiration, and resonance.  It'd be obvious that inter-player rewards require a shared vision of what's being celebrated/explored/handled.

I do agree that it's not prominent, but I think that that's for historical reasons of Forgites not being that interested in Sim and so on, not because Sim necessarily fails this condition of usefulness.<br/><br/>As an example of how the category of Sim has supported me in exactly this way you describe, consider two horror games, <i>Dread</i> and <i>Dead of Night</i>. It is my position that those games feature the same Creative Agenda mode - I won't say "same Creative Agenda" because certainly Dread is a tiny bit more literature-biased while Dead of Night has pretensions towards B-movie horror, or whatever, but it should be clear what I mean whether we accept the existence of the category of "Simulationism" or not.<br/><br/>Understanding Dead of Night has been useful for me in understanding Dread, because once I had a few strong play experiences with the former, I could see how the latter, too, supports the same type of creative achievement in what it says and how it does things. And once I understood the creative agenda, that provided me with the biggest analytical advantage GNS provides: I could judge the concerned rules systems in terms of their purposeful function, instead of being reliant on "do I like this" or "this seems too complex to me" or similar subjective measures that people seem to use for rpg analysis without Creative Agenda.<br/><br/>I could even extend this understanding of Sim away from these one-shot horror game territory and learn to recognize similar goals and priorities in other games, such as <i>Stalker</i>, a scifi Sim game with no overt technical, historical or literary connections with my starting point in Simulationistic understanding, or <i>Dragonpact</i>, a middle school D&amp;D hack likewise originating in an independent lineage.<br/><br/>I suppose I could write about this type of creative agenda in practical terms, what functions the rules system has and so on. I won't say for sure whether "Sim" is the correct external label and definition for it - I don't feel that I'm clear enough on this stuff to say whether e.g. GURPS <i>really</i> works on the same creative priorities that Dead of Night does, or if it's some fourth agenda, but to me it is obvious that insofar as "Creative Agenda modes" exist at all, there is one in the aforementioned games that is the same in each one of them, and it's not Gamist or Narrativist in nature. I'm calling it "Simulationistic" as a working hypothesis, because why not.<br/><br/>Of course, as I noted already, I agree with the observation that there are fewer people capable of discussing Sim-as-Sim in Forgite terms, and our insights on it probably do not match the comparative insights on Gamism and Narrativism. This is what I discussed earlier about the "internal theory of Simulationism"; it would certainly go a long way towards garnering acceptance to the concept of Simulationism, in my eyes as well, if we had more of a solid internal understanding of what exactly goes on in the creative black box when Sim is going on.<br/><br/>Does anybody have a Sim game under consideration, either to play or to design? We could start a design discussion thread in the old style and see if some useful understanding of how to do Simulationistic design can be derived from games considered to be Sim by people who think that Sim exists and think they understand it at least a little bit. (No idea if there are more than me in that category here, of course.) Who knows, it is possible that I could surprise David positively with Simulationistic insight <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>But yes, to answer your actual question explicitly, in case it didn't come through there: I agree that what you outline would be an excellent cause for reform. As I've described earlier in one of these threads, I'd be happy with a GNS reform that is actually based on the reality of Creative Agenda, while the various propositions based on superficial identity politics ("I want an Immersionist mode because I think GURPS sucks and I don't want to be in the same mode with it") are rather useless to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446780/#Comment_446780" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-16T19:21:39+00:00" title="July 16, 2015  7:21PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was away from this thread for a little while, and I'm very pleasantly surprised by the directions it's taking. <br/><br/>My thoughts on the matter, briefly:<br/><br/>1. I'm always a bit surprised to hear people saying that the forge was an anti-Sim place or ideology. I can certainly see why someone would get that impression, but it seems to me to be an accident of history.<br/><br/>First of all, Sim play dominates rpg discourse (or, at least, certainly did until recent times), often being the unspoken assumed mode of role paying gaming, period. Therefore it made sense for a bunch of designers looking to break new ground to concentrate on other modes of play. In the Big model, that's Step On Up and Story Now.<br/><br/>Second, the discourse at the forge went through certain periods. I'm not claiming to be an expert on any of this (I spent far less time there than Eero or John or Dave), but as far as I can see:<br/><br/>* At first, the focus was on Story Now, as a new and exciting mode of play which people didn't have good tools for. Lots of innovation and excitement! It helps that Ron is particularly keen on this kind of play, and that his own game, Sorcerer, was a shot at this style of play.<br/><br/>(There were lots of counterexamples, however. For instance, Vincent's first game which got him noticed at the Forge was "kill puppies for satan", which is generally agreed to be a Sim-supporting game - at least by Vincent, if not everyone else.)<br/><br/>* Next, Step On Up experienced a lot of popularity, since it wasn't as unsupported as Story Now in terms of games on the market, but still a bit of a novelty.<br/><br/>During this time people got really excited about rediscovering old-school gaming, which is surely connected to the whole OSR movement.<br/><br/>* After that, Ron and various others started getting more excited about Sim. I remember Ron posting a lot about Dead of Night, for example, which he loved, and various other Sim-supporting games. He went through a whole phase of "colour-first" discussions, which are arguably Sim-related, even if that's not the whole picture.<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm rewriting history a bit, but in my opinion it's not a total coincidence that after that Ron decided to close the theory forum and "move forward" with other interests.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446783/#Comment_446783" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-16T19:34:19+00:00" title="July 16, 2015  7:34PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2015 7:39PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Cross-posted with Paul; d'oh!)<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a>, I doubt we'll have any luck finding many people who (a) think Sim exists and understand it and (b) agree with each other on what it is and (c) agree that the game in question is in fact that thing.  <br/><br/>But one helpful respondent is better than none!  <br/><br/>I'd love to hear your insights on my supervillain game.  I know it does what I want from playtesting it, but all my takeaways re: supporting similar-agenda games are utterly mundane.  (1) inspire players with intro text, (2) prompt them to create characters with the features that make source material protagonists fun, providing a few apt pick-from lists to further prime a shared sense of what's appropriate, (3) use fanmail in play to make creative consonance explicit, and ta-da!  Celebration ready.  Now, to make it a playable game, we just (4) employ a procedural chassis (e.g. turns, rotating GM, endgame) to structure the proceedings, and (5) add some dice mechanics to introduce some uncertainty and variation in outcomes.  <br/><br/>Yawn.  I mean, I'm happy with my game, but I don't feel like any sort of agenda-supporting technique pioneer.<br/><br/>Also: maybe it's secretly Narrativist, and all that "fun villain stuff" is Premise, and which villains choose their neurotic goals over their master plans winds up as Theme.  I dunno.<br/><br/>The only way I can spot that the S/N difference even matters is if the highly random mechanics are taking some oomph out of the thematic choices.  The other 95% of the game seems fine either way.<br/><br/>Uh...  <br/><br/>What do you think, Eero?  Good test case or not?

It's certainly lacking the clear methodology of Story Now and Step On Up.<br/><br/>Perhaps this is because the foundation for Story Now tools comes from an existing field - Egri and dramatic theory. And likewise, Step On Up is already studied by all sorts of game theory. In both cases, we're not starting from scratch. <br/><br/>With Sim... I'd argue that we are.<br/><br/>My own hunch is that Sim play, being about the experience itself, might be much more wedded to Technical Agenda, which makes it hard to speak in absolutes. The "how" REALLY matters to the participants. (As does the "what", whereas in competitive or thematic play we might be more flexible with changing up the genre and colour.)<br/><br/>Here some types of play I think are likely Sim, but don't look anything alike:<br/><br/>* the traditional Illusionist long rpg campaign (functional variety), with large-scale GM plot and so forth.<br/><br/>* Rules-light collaborative story telling (like "Once Upon a Time", or a game of Baron Munchausen where the players don't care to compete with each other)<br/><br/>* historical emulation by war gamers looking to recreate famous battles.<br/><br/>* Simulation, "rules as physics" kind of play, where you might play to see whether Batman can actually defeat Superman.<br/><br/>* character immersion play, where the players want to experience bleed, like Nordic LARP.<br/><br/>Attempting a practical application of this (in a new thread) sounds like a fantastic idea!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446785/#Comment_446785" name="Item_113" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-16T19:46:07+00:00" title="July 16, 2015  7:46PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd be happy to take a look at your game, David.

Where previously, the fantasy genre could only tantalize readers with the visitation theme, allowing them to experience second-hand what it would be like to enter a fantastic world, Dungeons &amp; Dragons offered its players the ability to direct the action in that world...rather than merely watching over an author's shoulder as the protagonist's fate unfolds."

Insofar as Simulationism has something similar in the way of purpose, it's "celebrating the source material" as was suggested earlier - although I would rather call it "exploring" or "experiencing" or "handling" the source material: basically the Simulationistic reason to get together and imagine some shit up is because we're curious about this particular shit, while this is not the primary determinant for Narrativism. This is what I meant by Narrativism having an external purpose in contrast to Simulationism: it suffices for Simulationistic purposes that an airship is cool and let's talk some more about how cool our airship is; for Narrativism this sort of thing is at most pacing and build-up for what the airship will be used for, story-wise.<br/><br/>That being said, I'm certain that John has heard all this before in so many ways, not likely to convince him if I say it once more <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/></blockquote>\nActually, the idea of an external purpose seems like it is unstated subtext underlying the definitions, and I feel things are much clearer when it is brought out into the open. I would suggest that you include it in your overview / and definitions if you ever get to putting it in a more permanent form. <br/><br/>I do view things differently, but it's useful to understand different views. You see artistic satisfaction at expressing Premise as an <b>external purpose</b> - it is outside the game, as opposed to part of the game. I still see it as being a quality of the game and thus internal. On reflection, I pushed my interpretation as being right - but I realize that this is a subjective thing. If you think of certain artistic satisfaction as being external, it's external. <br/><br/>However, I'd like to dig a little deeper into understanding how you view this. I'll break down a few cases of different kinds of satisfaction: <br/><br/>1) Satisfaction at expressing a Premise (as in Lajos Egri) in a powerful manner - as in the Sorcerer RPG by Ron Edwards<br/>2) Satisfaction at creating a moving immersive, emotional experience - as in a Nordic larp like Mellan himmel och hav<br/>3) Satisfaction at creating a structured plotline (as in Syd Field) in a powerful manner - as in Theatrix by David Berkman et al<br/>4) Satisfaction at creating a detailed simulation of medieval England<br/>5) Satisfaction at creating a well-realized story - including theme and moral/ethical elements - in a chosen genre <br/><br/><br/>To me, these are all satisfaction at different qualities of the game, and I don't see anything distinct about adhering to principles of Lajos Egri. However, I'd be curious to see about how you divide them up into those which are internal and external. <br/><br/>I wonder - is it possible that the distinction is how you hold yourself relative to the events of the game - like point of view being first-person or third-person. So, external purpose means stepping back mentally/emotionally and taking satisfaction in a more analytic matter, as opposed to being immersed in the events. Does that make any sense? <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446818/#Comment_446818" name="Item_119" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-17T05:12:09+00:00" title="July 17, 2015  5:12AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David: I'd start with an overview of the game - and yes, a game text, if you have one.

I don't think that the distinction is in how detached and analytical the enjoyment of play is; instead, I'll try to show how the "external purpose" in Narrativism is, I think, about whether the players find meaning in the subject matter, or in their own unique artistic input.<br/><br/>Of your examples, number 1) is probably Narrativist, 2) could be, while 3-5 are likely Simulationist, just as you say. They could also all be Sim, all things being equal; I don't think that "simulating Egri storytelling" wouldn't be a possible Simulationistic ideal. Maybe it's not the first thing that comes to mind for somebody playing Sorcerer, but who knows what springs to the minds of men in this crazy world of rpg theory.<br/><br/>If we imagined that I had a more detailed view of these different play situations, including the oft-considered opportunity for reward cycle analysis (that is, I could see how, exactly, the group in question "sets em up and knocks em down"), then I would expect to be able to say with some certainty as to whether it's Sim or Nar that was going on. The difference I would be looking for would basically concern the way personal creative concerns would be put at stake by the participants: that external Narrativist concern you're asking for is basically the personal expression of the player, giving weight to the play, while in Sim contrariwise such putting yourself on the line is considered besides the point at best. Sim is more cooperative in the sense that the players are trying to pursue an unified Dream, while in Nar the individual, independent voices rise and ebb in significance.<br/><br/>For example, in case 4 I would expect that the satisfaction of simulating medieval England would involve subsuming of personal values and opinions to the pretense of objectivity - biased though such simulation necessarily is in small or great ways, the players do not elevate that bias as artistic expression; rather, they ignore it, hide it, or debate it to eliminate it, to achieve that satisfaction of delving into what to them feels like the subject matter itself, unsmirched by non-canonical elements. "Constructive denial", as Forgite Sim theory calls it.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that simulationist play doesn't involve personal creative satisfaction and pride, of course, it's just that in Nar the joy of play is in the meaningfulness of the expression itself, while in Sim the joy is in the quality of the material. Your case 5, for instance, could with little imagination be seen as a description of either Sim or Nar play - not because the two are very similar in whole, but because it is easy to describe either as "satisfying story creation". The Nar act of creation would be satisfying because the story feels right and novel and amazing to the participants, who are proud of themselves, while the Sim act would be satisfying because it truly captures what is the proper strength of the genre in question, leaving the participants with a surfeit of genreness in their heads, just as if they'd just finished a great genre novel.<br/><br/>(Having played both story-crafting Sim and story-crafting Nar, I'd say that usually the former is much more concerned with the execution-aspects of the storytelling itself; there's mood, GM storytelling skillz and such. When doing the same thing for Nar purposes we often don't have those concerns because all the attention is in shaping up the novel events, rather than the way they are described.)<br/><br/>I can totally see how the psychology of this is questionable (I mean literally uncertain, ripe for questioning - not "wrong" right out of the gate); one could see the above as quibbling about minor details of motivation where all the big parts are essentially identical. The GNS viewpoint on the practicals of it, though, is that the reason for why Nar and Sim are categorized in different boxes is not necessarily in that they "look different", but because a creative conflict exists in attempting to pursue both goals simultaneously and without distinction. So it is possible for the creative psychology to look pretty similar for both, but still be different in ways that cause practical incoherence in execution.<br/><br/>An example of such incoherence from my experience, one that recurs often while playing types of dramatic games that would naturally sway towards either Nar or Sim, is the question of artistic responsibility. I mention this because it latches onto this phrasing of "external purpose" as well. It is not unknown for players in a certain sort of dramatic roleplaying game to feel pressure and critique about their creative choices, when those choices are surprising and off-beat in comparison to what the other players expected. This is not uncommon in games that are set in stylized genres, such as say superhero games, because the play group is often not uniformly literate on the genre. The Nar and Sim attitudes towards this situation, and indeed the entire significance of the situation for them, are very different: in the Nar game the genre exists to become a platform for personal expression, and therefore the only questions in criticizing another player's contribution are essentially procedural (does the player have the right to make this move now) and cooperative (does the player disrespect other people's themes, does he understand the purpose of the game, etc.). In the Sim game, in contrast, the genre exists as a reason in itself, and thus the players may well come to debate whether an individual making surprising, off-beat moves is playing "wrong" and ruining the premise of play.<br/><br/>I've encountered the specific agenda distinction I describe above in superhero games, horror games and I think probably in something else as well - dungeon fantasy games, naturally enough. It would be misleading to imagine these situations as grand clashes of informed creative agenda, as in truth oddball players who make oddball moves in games are rather common, and the oddball player themselves is unlikely to be acting due to creative politics - they're just the subject of group discussion on how to handle off-beat creative inputs. Such moves mainly becomes the focus of a big debate when the nature of the game straddles that Sim/Nar line and the group becomes uncertain as to how to valuate the weirdness. (It's not always the Narrativist game that is the most egalitarian, or even most functionally able to handle weird players, I should note - a Sim game with world-building tech is often quite robust about incorporating surprising inputs.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446847/#Comment_446847" name="Item_120" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-17T14:08:05+00:00" title="July 17, 2015  2:08PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm glad you've talked about stylized genres a bit there, Eero.<br/><br/>To me, one of the big running issues with clashes within Sim has been the conflict between Genre Emulation Sim ( which may well benefit from mechanics/tools/methods/techniques developed for Narr games) and Physics Sim ( which tends to use tools/etc developed to support Gam).<br/><br/>Genre Emulation Sim is what I'm primarily interested in. <br/><br/>I've posited before that GES would benefit from mechanics that somehow produced the following spread of results when there's a question of <i>what happens next?</i><br/><br/>80% The outcome is within a range of results that one would commonly expect in the genre in question.<br/>15% The outcome is wthin a range of outcomes that are on the boundaries of what would be expected from the genre in question.<br/>5% the outcome is in a range of results that are generally outside of the genre, but that can be justified with some work.<br/><br/>Strangely, the 5% is still important, even very important, to GES. Those 5% of results are what make this game unique to the group engaging with/creating it.<br/><br/>Note that this is different from Physics Sim approach, although Physics Sim could exist within this framework, as a possible Genre Emulation subset.<br/><br/>This is just one under-explored thought about Sim. There are lots of under-explored areas worth looking into.<br/><br/>Mechanization of techniques to support game play where 1st character immersion is highly valued ( usually associated with Sim priorities) is almost entirely unexplored as a realm for experimentation and design.<br/><br/>(At least in mainstream tabletop design, English language circles. I understand there are some folks in Scandinavian countries really big into this for live action play.)<br/><br/>Exploration of Sim design techniques really has languished. It has fits and starts.<br/><br/>For examination of a tool I've found very useful for No Myth Genre Emulation Sim, check out Mythic GM Emulator ( a niche product that seems to not find much love in either mainstream nor dirty hippie circles). Not the most elegant design ever, but even crudely made, it's fantastic for those purposes, especially in stripped down form.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446852/#Comment_446852" name="Item_121" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-17T15:00:31+00:00" title="July 17, 2015  3:00PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's strong, strong stuff on GES, Bob - I've missed your work on the result spread before, but it seems solid and insightful to me here and now, and in accord with my own GES experience. That's the sort of stuff one would indeed desire more of in terms of Sim understanding.<br/><br/>Also agreed on mechanization of character immersion, it is an under-explored, yet an aspect that I find myself making minor attempts at whenever I'm gilding the rose on some game or other. For myself I blame the stultified orthodoxy of the Nordic tradition, I long ago threw the entire notion of immersion out of my own toolbox just so I wouldn't have to think about immersionists and the kinds of games they like to play <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Yes, this is something I can whole-heartedly agree with all right-minded GNS critics: the correct response to Sim being "wrong" is to do more work on Sim-type games and see what's what. Thinking back to Forgite discussion patterns through last decade, I think that this was never in much dispute; at least my own most stupid Internet fights (fortunately in Finnish, thus preserving my reputation in the English-speaking world) always were about how certain sorts of people hated the very idea of analytic rpg theory and new-fangled games without GMs or Golden Rule, not really about Sim-related conclusions themselves being faulty - difficult to be faulty when there really aren't that many conclusions. It seems to me that people who take a hand to it and do something interesting and irreverently counter to Forgite theoretical orthodoxy have generally been received rather well. I know that I myself adore the way the Finnish grand curmudgeon, Ville Vuorela, took heart from our stupid, stupid theory debates over the years and went on to produce the delightful post-Forgite Sim masterpiece that is the <a href="http://www.burgergames.com/stalker/EN_web/" rel="nofollow">Stalker RPG</a> <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446895/#Comment_446895" name="Item_122" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-17T19:20:21+00:00" title="July 17, 2015  7:20PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2015 7:20PM by 2097.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Peeps on rpg.net are always hyping Mythic GM Emulator though.

However, in my experience it only weakly correlates to the divide between traditional RPGs and post-Forge story games; and doesn't correlate at all with Lajos Egri. <br/><br/>Within traditional RPGs, there are two common behaviors among players: (1) is being a "Genre Fiend" - a term from Aaron Allston's players types, from "Strike Force" for Champions (1988). This is the player who insists that the game conform to their vision of the superhero genre. The other, (2) is deeply identifying with their character, and being very serious about what happens to them and what choices they make. This is sometimes derided as being immature and/or crazy or at least deeply eccentric, and is common enough to be regularly mocked in many portrayals of RPGs. I think in particular of the psychological case study of the young woman "Malori" who dealt with her depression in Call of Cthulhu games. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.rpgstudies.net/hughes/therapy_is_fantasy.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.rpgstudies.net/hughes/therapy_is_fantasy.html</a><br/><br/><br/>Within story games, I've observed a wide range of how deeply people are involved. For example, even among a group of dedicated story gamers, it was controversial to play "A Flower For Mara" with one circle. Many people were put off by how the game explicitly has the players bring in their own personal loss to the game. It is notable that "A Flower For Mara" is the rare exception in how it explicitly calls for players to bring their personal life into the game. <br/><br/>I personally have ranged back and forth between engagement with different story games. There have been a number of story games that I haven't found personally very meaningful, but I still contributed fun, interesting material drawing from the genre we are in. Fiasco, Sorcerer, and the Shab-al-Hiri Roach come to mind in particular. As far as I have seen, this material was received very positively. It didn't significantly matter to the other players that I was "faking it" - they appreciated the quality of the material. <br/><br/>I think this is a topic possibly better discussed disconnected from the rest of the baggage of GNS.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446905/#Comment_446905" name="Item_124" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-17T21:30:21+00:00" title="July 17, 2015  9:30PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2015 9:30PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>the Finnish grand curmudgeon, Ville Vuorela, took heart from our stupid, stupid theory debates over the years and went on to produce the delightful post-Forgite Sim masterpiece that is the <a href="http://www.burgergames.com/stalker/EN_web/" rel="nofollow">Stalker RPG</a> <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/></blockquote>I still really want to play this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446908/#Comment_446908" name="Item_125" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-17T21:39:00+00:00" title="July 17, 2015  9:39PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2015 9:41PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            K-Bob, I think there may be some truth in that ideal result spread you posited, but I'm not so sure about tying it to "what happens next?" highlight moments as opposed to every moment of play.

Being something of an echo chamber would necessarily be an outcome of that, no matter how open-minded and curious the people who actually were interested in participating.<br/><br/>The above meant that when people started "doing Sim" at the Forge, like Ron and myself playing <i>Dead of Night</i>, and the big Sim discussions with the Germans, and so on, it was not only pretty strongly colored by the earlier discussions with e.g. Mike Holmes and other early Sim-federates, but also somewhat constrained in readership, and generally lacking in social impetus simply because the majority were pretty keen on migrating to Story Games and playing Narrativist games and so on at the time. Unfortunately the early Sim-advocates had lost much interest in Forgite theory work at the time, after ironically spending inordinate amounts of time hassling Ron about Sim just a couple years earlier <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>So I guess I was left more with the impression that insofar as the GNS modes were focused on "one at a time" at the Forge, it just happened to be the case that the historical shuffle got to Sim last, at a time when the social capital had largely left the Forge behind. No wonder in that regard that the Forge couldn't be a great spearhead in developing Sim understanding - that's not something you achieve with just a few people puttering on it alongside their main projects. Theoretically you'd get Sim being developed elsewhere, by all those people who'd quit the Forge in disgust for the 2002-2004 anti-Sim sentiments, but, well, we know how that went - as far as I'm concerned FATE is the greatest single Sim game from the '00s, while the trad community continued (and continues) to create games that are commercially derivative, traditional, non-focused design; whether one considers that good or bad (not my point here), it is not the same sort of focused design work that was used at the Forge to push understanding of Nar and (to a lesser degree) Gam forward.<br/><br/>I guess somebody should write up a provocative Sim-favouring rpg theory, start a new website for game development, and see about gathering a like-minded crowd of indie developers to see what manner of breakthroughs might be achieved by combining insight. That's after all how the Nar breakthroughs of the early Forge (summed up in Ron's 2004 Nar article) happened, insofar as I understand it - by seeking and finding creative concord between half a dozen designers who each could bring in some pieces of the puzzle for the others to learn from.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446931/#Comment_446931" name="Item_134" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-18T15:12:54+00:00" title="July 18, 2015  3:12PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>[...] when people started "doing Sim" at the Forge, like Ron and myself playing <i>Dead of Night</i>, and the big Sim discussions with the Germans [...]<br/>So I guess I was left more with the impression that insofar as the GNS modes were focused on "one at a time" at the Forge, it just happened to be the case that the historical shuffle got to Sim last, at a time when the social capital had largely left the Forge behind.</blockquote>\nYeah, this is pretty much what I posted earlier (although that seemed to go unnoticed).

Other than the solo challenge a while back, the topic hasn't really gained traction with people. That and The reasons you outline are probably the culprit. <br/><br/>In G+ I created a community hoping to get interested people discussing the topic with an eye to design. It's been relatively successful, though I guess not as intense as the Forge discussions come across to me. Still, it's been mostly positive in that some other "engines" and frameworks have been shared (though I'm sure some of them were works in progress long before the group was created).<br/><br/>I don't think any of that would have happened without Tana Pigeon's GME.

I think that's somewhat misleading to what the stance is meant to be about, since the techniques of emoting in a scripted scene or dynamically responding to an audience in improv are somewhat externally directed while Actor Stance should probably be more agentic and focused on internal motivation and perceiving the situation around them.<br/><br/>I also have a draft of an essay where I critique the convoluted terminology and concepts around Positioning and Currency. The short version is that by using the slightly odd term "positioning" it can lead to thinking in RPGs-are-special-snowflakes terms when it's actually the same concept as position in other games (e.g. "the player's position on the soccer field is (x,y)" and "the player's position on the team is 'goalkeeper'" are analogous to "the character's position in the room is behind the ogre's back" and "the character's position in the kingdom is 'heir to the throne'"). This lets you recast Resources as a special case of Position (they're just very concrete, spendable positions) and makes Effectiveness into a function that takes Position as input. And then there's not really much need for a jargon term Currency (which is easily mistaken for "spendable tokens") since it's just System-in-action.<br/><br/>In terms of CA, I'm not sure if I'm correct in my understanding of the Big Model, but it seems to me that there's a lot of cruft in the definitions, and some of the terms have misleading connotations. I think the idea of "reward cycles" and "instance of play" are baggage from the Behaviorist stuff about what an external observer can say, when I suspect that what it's <i>really</i> about is what makes things subjectively fun on a moment-to-moment basis (longer term things matter, but mostly in how they are orienting your and shaping your subjective experience moment-to-moment). I also think that the historical context of how the theory was developed lead people to assume that it's about "preference matching" and "getting what you want", but I'm skeptical. I think it's more about System configuration. People might have preferences between sailboats, paddle-boats, and propeller-driven boats but the more important differences between these different types of machines is how they work differently, not that some people prefer some over others. I've said <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/adept/index.php?topic=431.msg4035#msg4035" rel="nofollow">elsewhere</a>:\n<blockquote>This might just be me, but the "top priority" framing doesn't seem to capture the notion of incompatibility expressed in Ron's parable of the pigs. The mental model I'm working with is that things are incompatible because the "parts" are used in different ways -- as an analogy, both a tent and a trampoline are made of a big flexible sheet, some line, and some rigid frame pieces, but they're put together in a fundamentally different ways because they're trying to do different things. And some things that would be perfectly fine for one (e.g. having a frame piece directly in contact with the flat/flexible thing) could be totally inappropriate for the other. </blockquote>\nI have <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/2014/06/30/the-meaning-of-fun/" rel="nofollow">my own tentative model</a> of how games work that I think accounts for GNS. The short version is that it's about making meaningful contributions, and one of the things that undercuts meaningfulness in a social situation is other people not noticing it. So priming players to be cognizant of the areas where other players' contributions will be happening helps those contributions feel meaningful. The various CAs are taxonomizing certain classes of games that happen to have some family resemblance, but that doesn't necessarily make them utterly incompatible. Here's an <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/adept/index.php?topic=431.msg4024#msg4024" rel="nofollow">instance</a> of me postulating how one might describe some elements of RtD play in this framework:\n<blockquote>I'm not 100% sure how this maps to the canonical concept of Simulationism/RtD, but in my effort to reframe things in a way that makes sense to me I've been trying to focus on how different systems are meant to be fun on a moment-to-moment basis, rather than in a top-down way. From that POV, I've been thinking that Sim/RtD might be when a game makes a contribution feel meaningful by making it about a unique contribution that's interpreted across aesthetic appropriateness (by analogy, Gamism would be when it's unique contribution gauged against whether it's relevant to "winning"). In that sense, it's helpful when games make some things more salient than others. If what's unique about your contribution is how your character portrayal is playing off a particular archetype, I can't pick up on that if I'm not on the same page about your archetype -- kind of like not being able to pick out a signal on a carrier wave I'm not tuned to. Games like Fate are regarded as Sim-facilitating because they make it easy to communicate your touchpoints and make them salient to the other players -- I can watch for how your character portrayal maps to your Aspects and appreciate the particular nuance you're bringing to it, whereas if I see you "just roleplaying" then I'm paying no special attention to the thing you're bringing to the table, and you can tell I'm not picking up on what you hoped to be meaningful, and then the fun leaks out. Doing the thing you're talking about [of established a strong shared vision], where you just discuss lots and lots of stuff about inspirational source material, can do a similar thing in a less formalized way if it causes similar concepts to crystallize in each of our heads. At least that's how I'm thinking about it.</blockquote>\nOne idea I've been pondering along these lines is that it seems to me that, while the players in properly-played <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> are making morally-relevant contributions, the GM is generally supposed to <i>not</i> do that and is instead trying to do a fair-minded aesthetics-based "what would happen next, given the way this world works?" or entirely aesthetics-based vivid portrayal of the situation. These seem to me to be the kinds of things you'd normally describe as Sim/RtD. So maybe we already have games that are hybridizing CA but the historical way we talk about players and GMs have masked it.<br/><br/>On the issue of whether StoryNow and RightToDream are distinct phenomena or not, in a <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+DanMaruschak/posts/2umixLCbq3C" rel="nofollow">recent G+ post</a> I noted an example of where a philosopher was noting that aesthetic issues can produce similar levels of "emotional juice" to moral issues when agreement about them is important to the parties involved.

I think the idea of "reward cycles" and "instance of play" are baggage from the Behaviorist stuff about what an external observer can say, when I suspect that what it's <i>really</i> about is what makes things subjectively fun on a moment-to-moment basis (longer term things matter, but mostly in how they are orienting your and shaping your subjective experience moment-to-moment).</blockquote>\nI'm enthusiastically on board with everything else you said (been lots of good posts in this thread, but that one ranks high nevertheless), but my experience says that the above is wrong - "reward cycles" are a real phenomena, even as the concept is also trodded out when Ron's espousing about his empirical leanings. The way I remember it, Ron developed the concept originally specifically to answer the question of where Creative Agenda actuates, but then he mostly ended up using it as an analytical aid in analyzing gaming - it's an interesting observation that Creative Agenda cannot really be observed externally, so you have to observe reward cycles and understand their nature correctly, on the premise that a game will only include reward cycles that accord with the CA the play is fulfilling.<br/><br/>To be specific, the "reward cycle" of a given activity of play is the arc of purposeful play starting from the moment of purpose emerging, and ending in the moment of psychological payoff - when the purpose is satisfied. Moment-to-moment fun has an interesting relationship with this phenomenon, but it's not simply that the former is a messed up way of describing the latter. (If I had to suggest something about that relationship off-hand, I'd go with "having a purpose to what you're doing instead of wandering aimlessly or waiting is often fun, moment-to-moment".)<br/><br/>For example, a player can have fun (whatever <i>that</i> word means) moment-to-moment because they have a sustainable personal curiousity in another player at the table (perhaps they want to know the other player better or something), and thus enjoy following their antics, all without that having anything to do with anything purposeful in the game per se. Likewise we could picture a purposeful yet grim sort of gameplay where the player is momentarily not enjoying themselves by whatever measure of "enjoy" we might use, yet would be engaged by a functional reward cycle.<br/><br/>Ron said at some point that reward cycles can differ in length quite a bit, and I have to say that my own play experience has amply demonstrated that; sometimes it's like 10 minutes from postulating a weighty creative idea to resolving it satisfactorily, while other times it's 10 sessions of play for a plan to come to fruition. I've written about some of our D&amp;D sandbox gaming arcs here now and then (<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20191/an-old-school-d-d-season-concludes-see-the-campaign-arc" rel="nofollow">here's the latest</a>) specifically because I've myself found it so interesting and peculiar to witness real-to-life reward cycles operating on a time-scale of months, over dozens and hundreds of hours of gameplay. You know it to be a reward cycle, too, when you finish it and realize how the climax of the arc was the creative payoff you'd been looking for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446956/#Comment_446956" name="Item_140" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-18T18:47:17+00:00" title="July 18, 2015  6:47PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 18, 2015 6:48PM by AsIf.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't doubt that they can exist, but surely reward cycles are fractal as well.

Less so in simpler and shorter games, more so in deeper and longer ones. The clever observer will note that this has intimate relations with the GNS claim of mode coherence: if GNS is correct, there should be some mechanism that ensures that concurrently operating reward cycles are, in fact, of a mode. In other words, one may question what exactly causes off-mode reward cycles to be incoherent.<br/><br/>At least part of the answer is that while a game often has multiple reward cycles going on simultaneously, a player is only generally engaged with one at a time - their purposefulness in acting upon the game state is driven by a particular reward cycle at a given time. Furthermore, another player will only understand their action if they understand the reward cycle, and will accept the action if they consider the reward cycle legitimate (for example, most wouldn't consider it legitimate if somebody was getting their jollies by ruining everybody else's fun), which would explain much about the incohesion phenomenon - you need to generally have players at least accept each other's reward cycles, and more ideally be actually playing towards the same reward cycle, for play to be coherent. This is reflected at a more conceptual level by the idea that GNS agenda modes predict coherence and incoherence.<br/><br/>That thing about reward cycles generally going off-line and on-line in turn is important for a general understanding of what happens creatively in a complex game. For example, a full panoply D&amp;D sandbox of the sort we've been playing around here a lot lately has many reward cycles at different levels: there's the satisfaction of concluding a short-term process such as logistics calculation or combat well, there's making concrete progress in an adventure, there's achieving a mid-term goal, even one for ending a session in high spirits, and so on. There's sometimes one for simply positing, executing and achieving an exceptional combat maneuver, like the time when we used cats as missile weapons against stirges in the spring - that one didn't take long from initiation to execution to satisfaction, it was quite satisfying to see how <i>brilliantly</i> my plan worked despite being so ridiculous, especially in the light of how very confident my character was about making it come about <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Returning to the idea of criticizing Forgite theory, I imagine that the claim that at most a single reward cycle is relevant to a single action is ripe for deconstruction. I'll suggest that while it is possible for an action to be <i>concordant</i> with multiple reward cycles at different levels of play, it is not so easy to imagine how multiple cycles could be <i>motivating</i> a single meaningful action at the same time, unless those cycles themselves happened to be so well in harmonious alignment (that is, pushing the player to the same direction for the same reasons) as to cohere into a single, over-riding creative agenda <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446961/#Comment_446961" name="Item_143" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-18T19:25:22+00:00" title="July 18, 2015  7:25PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 18, 2015 7:47PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For any game/play, I suspect we can (a) look at all reward patterns and also (b) try to identify a primary reward cycle.

First, what exactly a reward <i>is</i> can be hard to pin down. I was thinking of games like the computer game X-Com which has a bimodal strategic/tactical structure: you have a squad-level tactical mode where the benefit of killing aliens is that you collect their artifacts which you can research in the strategic layer, and the benefit of researching things in the strategic layer is better and different weapons, etc., for the tactical mode. It seems a little weird to me to call "more gameplay" a reward (in contrast to something like the lights and bells in a pinball game, those seem more unambiguously reward-like to me). You can have a similar thing with leveling up in some RPGs: are you fighting monsters to level up to get better at fighting monsters to get better at leveling up? For me the key element I was seeing in these examples was <i>consequentiality</i>, which is a way of making something feel meaningful. And focusing on "consequence" rather than "reward" let me sidestep the issue of whether a reward needs to be "over and above the normal".<br/><br/>And in thinking about it in an RPG sense, I asked myself "would <i>fake</i> rewards work?" (e.g. saying "nice one!" for your buddy's maneuver that you actually thought was mediocre in a challenge-oriented RPG) and my conclusion was they wouldn't be reliable for any length of time, 1) because we humans tend to be somewhat good at sussing out fakery and 2) faking esteem and appreciation is effortful and therefore unlikely to be sustained for very long. However, people are likely to spontaneously give these "social rewards" for things they find genuinely valuable. And coordinating and influencing what people value is an element of the System they're using. (And things like the building off of someone else's contributions and making them consequential to the game-state are a powerful non-falsifiable signal that those contributions were meaningful, which you <i>could</i> call a reward but then we're back to the question of whether a reward needs to be "over and above" or not). So meaningfulness struck me as the more fundamental concept, and social signals of approval, etc., are reinforcers of System but aren't necessarily load-bearing elements of the machine.<br/><br/>Also possibly worth noting, Ron's <a href="http://big-model.info/wiki/Reward" rel="nofollow">Big Model wiki has this to say about Reward</a> (something is up with the site so you have to go to "view source" to see it, though):\n<blockquote>When it's fun. Seriously, that's all. If playing this game with these people is rewarding, then you either do it more to enjoy it some more, or perhaps you say "we've done it" and stop happy. During play, when you're talking, listening, and enjoying both, then you're being rewarded. When you can look back at a session or game experience in general and feel good about it socially and creatively, then you were rewarded.</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446968/#Comment_446968" name="Item_150" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-19T00:57:20+00:00" title="July 19, 2015 12:57AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent stuff, Dan.

Have you read the book "Glued to Games"? They claim that a big factor in the success of (video) games is the mood-boost from fake competence - from experiencing e.g an assassin's competence and leaping between rooftops or Batman's competence at punching out thugs. On some level, we believe in those experiences, and our mood improves because of them.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446979/#Comment_446979" name="Item_152" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-19T12:34:49+00:00" title="July 19, 2015 12:34PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero:<br/><br/> I prefer Sim-Federe to Sim-federate.

I recall ne thread in particular where Mike tore apart PhysSim approaches to gunfights in gangster genre games in favor of something that was more dirty-hippyish mechanically, but which produced results more in line with what one would expect from a GenreEmulation engine.<br/><br/>But yeah, discussion at the Forge of all sorts was winding down, just as Sim was starting to come into its own as a topic worthy of discussion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446986/#Comment_446986" name="Item_153" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-19T23:06:32+00:00" title="July 19, 2015 11:06PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dan,<br/><br/>I like your distinction of "meaningful", being partially a creative gauge and partially a social measure. It doesn't sound all that distinct from the Big Model's take on things, to me, but maybe a nice slightly different perspective and set of vocabulary.<br/><br/>Or do you feel that there is some major way the two models are in conflict with each other?<br/><br/>To me, it sounds like they are pretty compatible. (And looking at "meaningful choices" still requires us to find something like creative agenda to be able to establish when players cohere around the same set of meaningful ephemera or fail to do so. So, for the moment, as you mention yourself in the text, it can work just fine with the concept of CA modes and so forth.)<br/><br/>Incidentally, I disagree with your Dogs example. I hesitate to bring it up, since it might be a derail, but I will anyway, just in case it's relevant to this specific difference in your model/theory/from your perspective.<br/><br/>You mention that the agendas of the players and the GM are distinct, since players are trying to engage moral choices and make meaningful statements about them, while the GM simply presents the world and the material, somewhat impartially.<br/><br/>I find this to be an inaccurate description, not only of actual gameplay, but even the text of the game. The GM in Dogs is instructed to draw out conflict and to push against thematic choices by the players, asking "Oh, yeah? How about now?", by preparing Towns which challenge their judgements, and so forth.<br/><br/>It seems to me that, while the GM has a different role in the game than players do, she still must play with an eye towards creating and engaging thematic choices, and therefore is <i>very much</i> on board with the creative agenda and engaged in "thematic play", Story Now, or whatever it is we're calling it: she just can't do it all by herself, but, rather, has a specific role to play in putting all the pieces in position in order for theme to emerge. I'd argue that a GM who avoids this consciously, and tries to play as an impartial referee, for instance, will be a sub-par Dogs GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446996/#Comment_446996" name="Item_154" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-20T01:30:10+00:00" title="July 20, 2015  1:30AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I like your distinction of "meaningful", being partially a creative gauge and partially a social measure.

I think my model is more useful since it potentially opens the window to breaking things down or assembling components in the different manner than the monolithic chunks demanded by the "3 recognized CAs" model, and also has the virtue of not being so tied to RPG-specific ideas. (I suspect this is not too dissimilar to what Vincent is aiming at in his "the Big Model is obsolete" stuff, although I suspect he's going to have a lot of handwave-y stuff about "the Object of the game"). <br/><br/>I agree the DitV stuff is potentially a derailing tangent, but I'll try to respond briefly:\n<blockquote>I find this to be an inaccurate description, not only of actual gameplay, but even the text of the game.

How about now?", by preparing Towns which challenge their judgements, and so forth.</blockquote>\nOne of the big difficulties I always had with GNS was wondering how it would categorize a genre-emulation game where moral issues are relevant to the genre. (For example, I have a genre-emulation game that does Epic Fantasy, and my game structurally entails the idea that it is important for the protagonist to defend their community from existential threats, which could easily be a moral theme). I don't know how orthodox this is, but several months ago I had this lightbulb moment: there isn't some kind of "one drop rule" where anything related to morality gets subsumed into StoryNow -- the issue is whether the fun/tension on a moment-to-moment basis comes from expressing "I say this is the human thing to do in this situation". So in DitV, deciding whether to escalate to shooting is that kind of decision. By contrast, saying something is "in genre" for a morally-tinged genre is still an <i>aesthetic</i> self-expression. When a DitV GM says "here is a situation that's relevant to gender roles, the Steward's authority, and romantic love" they aren't expressing any moral judgment at all, they're saying "here's the kind of town that's in-genre for DitV". I think the rules even explicitly tell the GM to not to decide what's right or wrong about the town or how the tensions should be resolved. At least that's my argument, I'm not sure it's 100% rock solid and I don't have the DitV rules in front of me so I can't quote things.<br/><br/>From my DitV GMing experience (which is not super extensive), I didn't find "Oh yeah, how about now?" to be a big factor. The way I built on ideas from town to town wasn't to try to box players in or find breaking points, it was to just use ideas as jumping-off points for new situations. So, for example, in one town they resolved the situation partly by running off some people from outside the faith who had set up shop in town. So in a later town I said "that was interesting, but those people were both outside the faith <i>and</i> outside the culture" and decided to explore that nuance by having a group of converts to the faith who had migrated from back East as part of the problem -- they're culturally foreign but are part of the faithful. Another time a town's trouble involved a couple who were living together under the cover story that they had gotten married in another town even though they had never really had their union approved, and part of the resolution involved the Dogs forcing them to publicly confess their lie and then marrying them in a proper ceremony. So I said "huh, apparently public confession has something to do with absolving sins, what would happen if someone had an odd take on that?" and I had the children of those converts from back East engaging in a practice where they'd simply gather in a circle and confess and forgive each other for various petty crimes. I wasn't making any moral statements <i>myself</i> by creating these towns, I was painting a tableau that I thought would be aesthetically appropriate and appreciated by the players. Similarly, a lot of the NPC roleplaying I was doing was just "what would this guy say/do in this situation?" thinking, occasionally influenced by the aesthetic call "have things been quiet for long enough that I should push some action with a conflict?".<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446997/#Comment_446997" name="Item_155" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-20T01:58:39+00:00" title="July 20, 2015  1:58AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2015 1:59AM by Paul_T.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While I follow what you're saying, wasn't your curiosity in formulating those situations away of <i>posing</i> moral questions?<br/><br/>I mean, you wouldn't paint an aesthetically appropriate tableau of a Town where the knitter's circle has decided to knit copies of children's books... because it doesn't particularly pose any moral questions the players can confront.<br/><br/>Much like the GM in an OD&amp;D game doesn't *decide* who wins, the players or the monsters, but, rather, sets up a dungeon and then adjudicates rule calls, you, as the Dogs GM, don't make moral statements yourself: you just pose the questions, in the form of the Town and its problems.<br/><br/>(Also, in my own Dogs experience, the game is really most fun when the GM is pushing the players pretty hard, using the dice and raises to put as much pressure on them as possible, as opposed to saying, "Oh, I guess it would be in-genre if the Steward broke down and decided to side with the Dogs now."

But if you're writing a character drama and decide that the course of events has pushed one of the characters to their limits and murder now seems like a valid course of action to them you're saying something about the moral behavior of humans (or at least that human). When creating a Dogs town you're not saying that the Steward is a bad person or that Sister Patience is justified in what she's doing or that Brother Lemuel is deserving of nothing but scorn and swift retribution. You're saying "here's some stuff, I wonder what will happen when the Dogs show up". You're not doing the kinds of things we normally use our moral intuitions to do.<br/><br/>On the comparison do old-school D&amp;D dungeon crafting: I want to say something like "objection, assumes facts not in evidence". Even if we assume that the players are in it for the challenge I'm not sure the GM always is. I'm not super engaged with the OSR, but I gather that both "naturalistic" and "heh heh heh, let's see them beat <i>this</i>" approaches to dungeon-crafting are valid and it's not obvious to me that a naturalistic referee GM is doing the same kind of thing as a challenge-oriented player in a game like that.\n<blockquote>(Also, in my own Dogs experience, the game is really most fun when the GM is pushing the players pretty hard, using the dice and raises to put as much pressure on them as possible, as opposed to saying, "Oh, I guess it would be in-genre if the Steward broke down and decided to side with the Dogs now." Having said that, though, I think it's definitely possible to play Dogs in a genre-emulation mode, and it's possible that's what your group was doing.)</blockquote>\nNo, I don't think we were playing genre-emulation DitV. I think we were playing straight-up by-the-boook DitV. (Also, I don't have the conflict sequence in front of me to describe the exact technigue, but sometimes it's very effective to have NPCs take heavy hits and get beaten by the Dogs. Resisting the Dogs will tooth-and-nail isn't the only thing that puts "pressure" on a DitV player. Experiencing how hard a Dog is capable of hitting contributes to that, too.)\n<blockquote>When it comes to the theory - and sorry to be taking such a confrontational angle, as I actually really like what you've put down so far - you criticize the Big Model for lacking any clear and falsifiable claims, but does your understanding lead you to making any claims yourself?

When I first wrote it I think I had hoped people would prod it with counterexamples, e.g. "X is fun, but I don't see how it maps to your theory", etc. I think I had also hoped to use it as a framework to see if I could better identify issues and give feedback on game design stuff, but I don't think I've had many opportunities to do that (people don't seem to talk about their in-progress game designs much, at least in the places I've been hanging out).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447002/#Comment_447002" name="Item_159" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-20T04:16:28+00:00" title="July 20, 2015  4:16AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dan,<br/><br/>I follow you on the criticism (linked), and your stance on game priorities. I don't agree, however; I think that, although a GM's role is to create a dungeon and then act as a referee, or to create a Town and then "reveal it in play", she is still a willful and conscious participant in the "game" at hand. In other words, the GM comes to the table willing to leave her hand off the tiller, but, still, she comes to the table because she wants to see whether the players and their adventurers will live or die, and to see what moral judgements the Dogs will make. She is not a disinterested party, and, I would argue, a good GM is one who is very much engaged in that, and aware of her role as someone who brings material to the table in order to see those things in action.<br/><br/>A soccer analogy might be: the goalkeeper cannot accomplish the team's goal (score against the other team), but is still very much committed to doing everything she can to make sure the team has the best chance of winning possible (particularly by keeping the other team from scoring, which is similar to the GM "pushing hard" on issues in Dogs play). The referee, similarly, is fully engaged in the game, despite having chosen not to take sides: his goal is to ensure and arbitrate the competitive goals of the game. A referee who forgets that the goal of the proceedings is to hold a fair competition between two teams and reveal the better team would not be doing a good job.<br/><br/>In the same way, the Dogs GM - as you say - has the ability to decide when the NPCs will "take heavy hits" and lose conflicts. But I would say that a good Dogs GM does so precisely in order to push on the thematic/moral issues at stake: for instance, to highlight the effectiveness of violence, or the uselessness of some other approach. She is aware of the developing themes and plays to them. A Dogs GM who decides when NPCs give in conflicts based on "what looks genre-appropriate" or "what would be realistic right now", I think, wouldn't be as effective.<br/><br/>For that reason, I do very much feel that the GM in this games is an active and conscious participant in the creative goals of the game.<br/><br/>As for the theoretical ramblings, I'm curious what kinds of counterexamples you were hoping to hear. Did you have anything in mind yourself, or were you just hoping that someone would surprise you?<br/><br/>While I find that your thoughts are very cogent, and find myself nodding along in many places, I can't find any points of practical application where we can test the validity of the ideas in some kind of at-the-table or design test.

It's interesting, we can learn a lot from it. And you people who talk about "Role-playing not Roll-playing" should shut up. It's not what I personally am looking for, but it's cool.<br/><br/><b>Simulationism</b> Rules for <em>stuff</em> have overrun RPGs like kudzu. Look at the number of splatbooks any major game line has. White Wolf. D&amp;D 2E. GURPS. Palladium. And so on. And you know something about splat book bloat? In almost all cases the more splatbooks you use the worse the game gets. But people seem to like splat book bloat or they wouldn't sell.<br/><br/><b>Narrativism</b>. Character driven stories. Inter-character drama. Tough moral choices. Good stories. This is what we have been promised for years by White Wolf with its so-called Storyteller System. And what these games fail to deliver. Vampire is after all commonly played as "Superheroes with Fangs". And if we all love the promises of Vampire but they don't deliver we should make something that does. Who will join me?<br/><br/>And the G&amp;N parts are both pretty good from where he was standing.<br/><br/>The other thing is that Genre-Emulation Sim is very much a thing now and rightfully so. But from memory there were surprisingly few genre-emulation sims in the 90s as opposed to Physics-emulation that made nods to genre. Even Feng Shui was covered in physics sim and had an entire sourcebook on how much damage throwing a filing cabinet as opposed to a desk did. This was the hobby that gave us MERP and the critical result of skeleton liquified, use a spatula in a Tolkein themed game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447016/#Comment_447016" name="Item_163" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-20T12:44:48+00:00" title="July 20, 2015 12:44PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            MERP and Feng Shui are cool                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447017/#Comment_447017" name="Item_164" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-20T13:27:10+00:00" title="July 20, 2015  1:27PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A-yup, that pretty much matches my understanding Neonchameleon, right down to it being fairly time period specific.<br/><br/>And no, I don't recall much commercially successful in the way of Sim that tried to get much away from Phys-Sim mechanics that were well-known.<br/><br/>I think "lite" rules were often a stab at GenreSim in a way.<br/><br/>In any case, as a Call to Action, I think GNS did a great job of sparking off experimentation with "Narr", and I think it added to an already existed and building trend to rehabilitate Gamism.<br/><br/>2097: I played a whole lot of MERP for a while myself and loved it, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon" title="Neonchameleon"><img alt="Neonchameleon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon">Neonchameleon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447018/#Comment_447018" name="Item_165" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-20T13:27:33+00:00" title="July 20, 2015  1:27PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I didn't say they weren't.

For example, it's easy to see tactical combat in the mechanics and premise-addressing in the flavor text if that's what you're looking for, but the game's support for those modes of play is incomplete.<br/><br/>Whether this murky signalling crossed up 5% of groups or 95%, I don't think anybody knows.  I'd guess a huge percentage suffered some mild confusion or frustration, but only a small percentage couldn't overcome that to have fun of some sort.  <br/><br/>Most of my World of Darkness play thrived by glomming onto some stuff from the books and ignoring other stuff (including some rules).<br/><br/>And, of course, this is far from unique to Vampire.

The assumption is that <i>there were people who wanted it to do Narrativism, and were disappointed when it didn't.</i><br/><br/>Contesting that assumption would be a fair thing to do - you could e.g. think that Narrativism is an artificial invention and that practically nobody wanted that thing before the Forge made it popular, at which point people shifted their preferences. This would be the exact opposite of the GNS position, which is that the agenda modes describe real human psycho-social needs that have existed independent of giving them names long before the theory, or even before roleplaying as a form.<br/><br/>I don't think that it's very sensible to critique Forgite understanding of Vampire on the grounds that the game text doesn't really promise Narrativism. Of course it doesn't, as no game text of the time did - almost all trad games of the period make vaguely contradictory promises about simultaneous character empowerment, dramatic stories, exciting challenges and whatever else. Insofar as we can say Vampire to differ from other games of the early '90s, it is generally taken to be more artistically ambitious and serious about attempting to provide emotionally touching dramatic moments than something like say GURPS or AD&amp;D. The Forgite claim is that a significant number of people were disappointed when this "emotionally touching drama" proved to be something rather different from their own creative interests - ill suited for Narrativism, that is, and a better fit for a Sim game where the GM pre-plots a dramatic story using the player characters as their main protagonists.<br/><br/>So the old complaint about Vampire not being Narrativist isn't so much about Vampire being falsely advertised (even if there is a tinge of that), it's more of a claim about the existing interests and needs of the player base, and how Vampire historically disappointed them. That claim could still be wrong, of course, if you feel like doubting it, but it doesn't really have anything in particular to do with what Vampire actually does. Vampire could be a solid block of wood, and the only thing that would change in the Forgite discourse would be how stupid the Forgite ex-Vampirist feels themselves as they realize that they've been putting their creative hopes upon a game that doesn't really support their interests. As things actually are, Forgite Vampire critique tends to blame the game more than the player, which I think is somewhat fair - not in the sense of Vampire being somehow criminal, merely in that it's not very good in comparison to what Forgite people generally consider a satisfying quality of game design to be. Were Vampire merely a block of wood, intended to act as a door stop, it would be fair to say that the correct target to blame would be the stupid player who foolishly thought that Vampire was a roleplaying game of cooperative dramatic storytelling instead of a block of wood. It all depends on how much of the blame you want to put on the stupid reader or the stupid book, and in this case it's at least not outright insane to put some of the blame on the book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447100/#Comment_447100" name="Item_181" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-21T14:57:20+00:00" title="July 21, 2015  2:57PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why is it "fair" to blame a game for not being what it never attempted to be or said it was?

The assumption is that <i>there were people who wanted it to do Narrativism, and were disappointed when it didn't.</i><br/></blockquote>\nI suppose there could have been people looking for Narrativism before the concept was widespread or popularized by GNS, but I honestly don't think the writers of Vampire had that in mind when they wrote the book nor do I think any significant portions of gamers playing vampire were either. When people talked about things like 'story' in the late 80s and early 90s, they didn't mean anything approaching the concept of narrativism at all. It was a flexible term that could have referred to anything from "role-play heavy" to "players are participating in the GM's story". Sure there may have been some players out there who read Vampire and were expecting something like what we eventually saw on the forge a decade or so later, but I don't think you can you can rightfully say the game failed. That seems to be an argument based on equivocation around terms like 'story', 'storyteller', etc. By all means say it failed for other reasons if you don't like the game. I just don't think we can measure its success on a model that didn't really gain currency until well after it was published (I realize people were talking about similar concepts in the early days of the internet, but very few game groups were aware of these things). <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447106/#Comment_447106" name="Item_183" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-21T15:56:39+00:00" title="July 21, 2015  3:56PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If <i>My Life with Master</i> wasn't very clear about it, and all told it was a perfectly understandable human error to get mixed up about it, then sure, it would be somewhat fair to put part of the blame on the MLwM game text. It could have accounted for the pedagogical difficulties and the likelihood of the audience reading it in the wrong creative context, and corrected for that by being more clear and specific about what it is and is <i>not</i>. Isn't that reasonable?<br/><br/>There are plenty of game texts where I think it's pretty fair to criticize the game text for not being as pedagogically clear as it could be. Often, note, such artistic critique does not imply some manner of failure on the part of the creator so much as it tells about our changing demands for what we expect of the artifacts of art; we generally do not hold e.g. <i>Odysseia</i> to task for not including extensive psychological first-perspective narration like a proper modern novel would. Sometimes, on the other hand, we do think that a text is a disappointment and a failure taken in its own context and merits - the creator should have managed better.<br/><br/>I think that much of the rancour people used to have for Vampire (I think much of it has dissipated with time, as time is wont to heal all wounds) derives from the specific disappointment and frustration of their own artistic goals when trying to use the game; they expected and wanted more, and the game failed to deliver. The observation that it didn't really try only tells us that the people involved were misinterpreting the text, which still leaves open the question of whether they were morons or whether the text, perhaps, wasn't as clear as it could be.<br/><br/>I imagine that if Vampire was an earlier text that wasn't contrasted with other games in its marketing the way it was, people wouldn't blame it so much for not being a Narrativist game. It coming out at a time when Narrativist interest was bubbling under the cultural surface, and positioning itself as the "story game" in comparison to the dice-rolling munchkin games, certainly contributed to how people would later come to be disappointed by it. As I said, there are many perfectly good explanations for why anybody could get mixed up on this, so it is "fair" to put some of the blame in the communication failure on Vampire. (Particularly so when e.g. I would be absolutely amazed if somebody unearthed an early '90s missive from e.g. Mark Rein-Hagen where he specifically declaimed that Vampire would be a perfectly good game for a narrativist playstyle - expressed in whatever words one might have used at the time to make a distinction between genre Sim and Narrativism. I would be flabbergasted, frankly, in a gaming culture riddled with One True Way for any commercial publisher to even hint at their game not being the right tool for the job.)<br/><br/>I don't have any personal relationship with Vampire in particular, but I've had similar experiences with other games. MERP, for instance, was something of a disappointment to me as a youngster, on similar grounds: it "promised to me" an adventure game of magical Tolkien-y flavour, but, well, you know what the game is really like. You could quibble about that "promise", and perhaps a close reading of the text <i>knowing everything we now know</i> would come to conclude that legalistically speaking MERP never promised me anything of the sort I believed it did. Nevertheless, I would hold that the young Eero wasn't the only party to blame when he failed to decipher that game's true nature and purpose in the early '90s.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447123/#Comment_447123" name="Item_184" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-21T19:06:49+00:00" title="July 21, 2015  7:06PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            merp is like being in the mud and fighting orcs.<br/>it's like luis bermejo's version of lord of the rings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20260/arguments-against-gns-big-model/p3" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20260/arguments-against-gns-big-model">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20260/arguments-against-gns-big-model/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20260/arguments-against-gns-big-model/p3" rel="prev">3</a><a class="Highlight p-4 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20260/arguments-against-gns-big-model/p4">4</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F20260%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F20260%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
