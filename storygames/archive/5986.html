There is no restriction on info-sharing, and in theory, better play comes from info-sharing, but i don't see a lot of stuff that physically encourages it.<br/><br/>Like, why do you have a character sheet where only you see your character's name? Were you going to forget the name? Probably not. How about motivations? Again, probably not. Now, what about the other players. Stats? Maybe. Probably other players won't need that...<br/><br/>And then, for that matter, why just character stuff? Why not world stuff? Mood, theme, snippets of feeling, all kinds of stuff.<br/><br/>Now, I know I'm not the only person who has thought of this, so I figured there have already been some ideas made officially parts of a game along these lines..                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133719/#Comment_133719" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T09:57:11+00:00" title="March 10, 2008  9:57AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We've found that in Spirit of the Century and other 'aspect using' games, we have got a lot of mileage from sharing Aspects on a cheat sheet.

Don't tell me you haven't seen this. No, I'm not being facetious. <br>\n<br>\nNo, the rules don't indicate this, but they don't indicate that it's illegal, either...<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, it's very easy to make a snap diagnosis that there's some dysfunction going on in these cases, and there probably is in some. But a great many people consider this normal fun play. The suprise reveal of information, or the puzzle that the player presents the other players, is a form of creative outlet. For the other players, in theory, it creates suspense (though I'd argue that it's often/usually kept secret far too long, or permanently). <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's also part of the "immersion" ethic, where you're only supposed to know what the character knows. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, lots of games actually make sharing of this information automatic. There are weak cases where the text tells players to "discuss" character concepts, for instance, before selection. These are easily dodged, however, because they don't indicate full disclosure specifically. Stronger cases are like Polaris, in which a player simply has to see the other player's sheets in order to be able to choose what character aspects to invoke. <br/>\n<br/>\nSorcerer makes it pretty plain that the diagram needs to be shared with others... that's what it's for, after all, is to give others (and yourself) an idea of how you visualize what interests you about the character. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn Alyria (at least the version I played), the "Story-Map" is laid out in advance, with all characters, and then the characters are selected by the players. Meaning that every player understands every character's place in the map, at least... my character could be one you made!<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm sure we can think up lots more. Are the above examples the sort of thing you're looking for? Not many games actually mandate some central map, or easy to see formats for others, but isn't passing a sheet pretty OK for this? <br/>\n<br/>\nI find it interesting that it's pretty common procedure for convention games to set up teepees with the character name and role on them in front of each player, even if it's not for gaming with friends. I think that for a long-term game, you're assumed to be able to have time to absorb the roles of the other players, whereas in a con game, it's expedient to do labels to avoid a learning curve. <br/>\n<br/>\nLARPS, too, will often have some sort of player indicator, the most intensive being a costume, of course. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133725/#Comment_133725" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T10:10:00+00:00" title="March 10, 2008 10:10AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike<br/>Those are more the sorts of thing I'm thinking of, yes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133726/#Comment_133726" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T10:15:44+00:00" title="March 10, 2008 10:15AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            C'mon yourself, Mike!

If you asked why, they'd say something like, "Your character doesn't know any of this stuff about my character, so I'm not going to let you see it."<br/>\n<br/>\nSame sort of logic as a GM who says, "Don't suggest tactics to the other players, your character isn't there to do so."<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, in general, I'd say that your experience, Jason, is in the minority. That's not to say that all D&amp;D games involve this sort of information hoarding, or even that all players in these games do it. But just that it's quite common, and part of the most common "immersion" styles of play. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is to the point where, in most of these games, if you were to reach for somebody's character sheet, and look at it without their permission, this would be considered a huge social contract breach. Like looking at somebody naked without asking first. And, further, it's a common player behavior to cover up the character sheet if it's lying in front of them, and they see people peering in their direction. Much like trying to prevent copying on a test in school. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor real. Note that for a while I thought that this was all kid stuff, that people grew out of later in their gaming, but then I encountered adults who do precisely the same things. And, again, I'm not being judgmental, I assume that this is important to these people to enhance their gaming fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133730/#Comment_133730" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T10:32:08+00:00" title="March 10, 2008 10:32AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Both those games are in playtest/beta/ashcan, as is Brennan Taylor's<i> How We Came To Live Here</i>, which is hugely dependent on a village R-map.  <i>Ganakagok </i>too, but not as intensely.  <i>Sign In Stanger </i>has community resources that are constantly referenced in play.  <br/><br/>I think the table tent idea would be really useful if applied broadly.

And the movement of the pieces relates to what has happened in the previous scene and sets up subsequent scenes.  Generally, each player has a piece or peices assigned to them and has total control over moving them.  Generally, the player moves his own pieces, but sometimes other players or the person running the game (or GM) moves pieces.  Most of the diagrams I've used are not manipulated in a tactical way to ensure survival or the results you want, so people are less worried about someone moving their pieces in ways they don't like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133749/#Comment_133749" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T11:29:53+00:00" title="March 10, 2008 11:29AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's verrry interesting, Joe.

One player has the power to tweak the movement rules for one character, to place in, or remove a character from danger as he chooses.  So what usually happens is that the chapter ends and everybody figures out which way they move, and one player adjusts for everybody as they declare their direction.  Then it becomes obvious who is in trouble, and those players plead their case to the leader, the guy who can adjust one position.  Sometimes everybody moves their own token.  Once it is settled, there's generally some kibbitzing about what the new positions mean for the next chapter.  So there's a strong social component connected to the procedural, move-bits-around stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133751/#Comment_133751" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T11:32:07+00:00" title="March 10, 2008 11:32AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3637" rel="nofollow">Here's an old discussion</a> about using index cards to drive, well, everything.

At the beginning of the game, there's a set of situation creation procedures that lets players add elements to both maps. <br/><br/>In play, the whole point of a player turn is to determine how much can be added to the maps, and by whom. That is, in addition to assigning narration rights either to the active player or the GM, the dice tell how much new stuff can be created by both adversaries in support of the narration. Now, some of that new stuff may show up on individual character sheets as traits or belongings, but some will take the form of new characters, new relationships, new places, and new "facts on the ground." Note that during a given turn, both the player and the GM may be adding facts to the world.<br/><br/>I should point out that the points to create new facts are a limited resource: they deplete a counter that counts down to the Dawn and the end-game stage. Additionally, there is a strategic calculation to the dice manipulation that determines the outcome of a turn. Every die that gives you the power to add to the maps is a point that you don't have for "Good Medicine" that determines your fate and the world's at game's end.

It would be a gaming etiquette <i>faux pas</i> for me to reach over and look at <i>gasp!</i> someone else's character sheet, or even ask to see it.<br/><br/>I still don't know what race one of the other characters is. The player won't tell me, in character or out of character.<br/><br/>Yeah, I think that's stupid and immature.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
