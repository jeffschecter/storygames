Think of those players that don't go to cons but still wish they got a demo of the game.

For example, he suggested I could put out <a href="http://misspentyouthgame.com/" rel="nofollow">Misspent Youth</a> in its current, punky form, as well as in an anime/Pokemon form, and in an Avatar-like form. You change the art, the layout, and the flavor of the text with each version but the basic game remains the same. The idea here is not to resell the same game to multiple people, but to reach out to markets you're not currently addressing.<br/><br/>I've been too lazy to act on it, but I like the idea a lot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195496/#Comment_195496" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-04T11:53:16+00:00" title="March  4, 2009 11:53AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Andy,<br/><br/>One other thing that I think is important in addition to the other good stuff here: We have Wikis (one for Burning Wheel and one for Burning Empires) and encourage the fans to post anything they create there, from characters to new lifepaths and traits to monsters and spells.

Answer game questions. Make it a major point of contact. Call out things from the forums all the time.<br/><br/>Add the option to subscribe to the blog via email. Many blogs do this but not many do it the way they should, e.g. loudly and with some consideration.<br/><br/>Add the option to get a well-designed (well-templated actually, otherwise it's impractical) PDF emailed to them every week, instead of getting the individual blog posts. Free PDFs on a regular basis, even if they're only two or three pages, would make a certain segment of gamers go nuts for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
