                    I ain't got no home.<br/>I'm just a wandering 'round.<br/>I'm just a wandering working man;<br/>I go from town to town,<br/>and the police make it hard<br/>wherever I go.<br/>I ain't got no home in this world anymore.<br/><br/>My brothers and my sisters<br/>are stranded on this road.<br/>It's a hard and dusty road.<br/>A million feet I've trod.<br/>And a rich man took my home,<br/>drove me from my door,<br/>I ain't got no home in this world anymore<br/><br/>Have a look around,<br/>it's mighty plain to see:<br/>This world is such a great<br/>and funny place to be.<br/>The gambling man is rich.<br/>The working man is poor.<br/>I ain't got no home in this world anymore.<br/><br/><i>-Ain't Got No Home</i><br/>Woodie Guthrie<br/><br/><br/>The live fiction aspect of Drifter's Escape is in some need of testing (the prose fiction aspect is probably in need of some editing, but we can handle that in-house.)  I'm looking for some folks that are willing to sit down and give the game a whirl for a few hours.<br/><br/>The Drifter's Escape is an anthology of prose fiction, live fiction, and poetry that my brother and I are putting together.  The focus of the anthology is on wandering men, hoboes, drifters, homeless, migrant workers, and the American traditions surrounding them.<br/><br/>The live fiction part also draws on the mechanical traditions of Trollbabe, Dogs in the Vineyard, Capes, My Life With Master, and Polaris.<br/><br/>I'm going to be handling this like my other playtests:  Those interested will be sent the present game text, and will be expected to write up game reports of their sessions -- whether by posting them on the Forge forums or by e-mailing them to me privately.<br/><br/>Those interested should contact me via e-mail at taogames@gmail.com                </div>
