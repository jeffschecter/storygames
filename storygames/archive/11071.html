My latest fave is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/wave-dice-robot/" rel="nofollow">Dice-y</a>, a dice rolling 'bot for Google Wave. (Anyone concerned about Google Wave's ability for anyone to freely edit blips will be relieved to hear that you can "play back" a full log of changes to a wave, thus validating the results if you're concerned).<br/><br/>However, the prototype I need to test uses <i>cards</i>, not dice. Further, its use of cards is rather original, in that it doesn't easily map onto a game of Hearts or something like that.<br/><br/>Have you come across any websites that offer (preferably validated) persistent decks of virtual cards? Ideally it would support multiple hands, discard piles etc but if necessary I can simulate those assuming I have at least "draw" and "shuffle" functions.<br/><br/>Failing that, can you recommend an offline method to handle web-mediated Play-By-Post games / playtests? My fallback is to handle all card drawing myself using a real deck of cards next to the keyboard and have the players query me for draw information, but this is non-optimal as the design relies quite heavily on secrecy.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Irishvince" title="Irishvince"><img alt="Irishvince" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/464/n77MQHB4WLBHG.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Irishvince">Irishvince</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245633/#Comment_245633" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-07T19:37:01+00:00" title="December  7, 2009  7:37PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            you might want to check <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.vassalengine.org/community/index.php" rel="nofollow">Vassal</a> .

I tried out Filip Luszczyk's <a href="http://vassalengine.org/community/index.php?option=com_vassal_modules&amp;task=display&amp;module_id=610" rel="nofollow">Bucket of Dice</a> module and it's super-sweet in its flexibility.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
