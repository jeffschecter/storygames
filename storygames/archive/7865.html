We just finished <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_3" rel="nofollow">Persona 3 FES,</a> which was completely awesome, and I really wish there were an RPG that could kind of model the themes and feel of the game.<br/><br/>Don't tell me to play Misery Bubblegum! I know it's about high school students. Or Panty Explosion. I'm looking for a game with themes of personal responsibility, coming to terms with the inevitable, loss, and personal autonomy vs. free will. I mean, come on, it's a dating sim where at night, you shoot yourself in the head with a nightmare gun to evoke a terrible tarot-based creature from your psyche to battle the evil that humanity has been calling for to end the world because existence is so bleak. And then in the morning-- oh crap! It's finals!<br/><br/>Anyone play this and have RPG recommendations for me? Or feel like writing something I'm too lazy to write? Because either would be awesome.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174382/#Comment_174382" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-09T14:56:23+00:00" title="October  9, 2008  2:56PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Every word I have read around and about Bliss Stage says "Persona 3" to me.<br/><br/>I suspect that all it needs is a different coat of paint.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174397/#Comment_174397" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-09T16:20:41+00:00" title="October  9, 2008  4:20PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did somebody say "Bliss Stage Hack"?
