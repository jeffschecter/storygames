The AP is on the Lucre Press blog, <a href="http://lucrepress.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">here.</a> Comment away.<br/><br/>If you know nothing of this game (likely, considering my silent running of the past 6 months,) here's a summary:<br/><br/>For any first-time readers, Contract Work is a game of Debt and Hitmen struggling to pay that debt. You don't become a Hitman for fun, you do it for money. (And if you did come to the business for fun, it's not long before a mobster, the law, or a black ops program has a huge investment in you.)<br/><br/>Players are called Hitters and the GM is the Interrogator. The game is played as the Interrogator leads the Hitters by way of question and answer through the job, starting from the kill and tracing back the path to it. Cul-de-sacs and lies are just as much a part of the game as truth as Hitters narrate their successes and failures to satisfy the Interrogator. Is the Interrogator an FBI agent, ready to send the Hitters away for the rest of their lives? Their lawyer hoping to make a convincing case? The Boss wanting the seedy details of the job he ordered? Only the end of the job will let us know.<br/><br/>The game system is about resource management. Every aspect of the mechanics reflect money. Time is money, effort is money, growth is money, cash is money. Characters are built in a point buy system and wagers are made with poker chips to resolve Confrontations that are determined by how much the Hitters and Interrogator wagered on attacking their foes and defending themselves. There are Free Action tokens that allow them to act covertly and hold an advantage over the Interrogator and Risk tokens that let the Interrogator push back.<br/><br/>Hitters get some money up front for a job and try to make the Target spend all his money so that there's nothing left to pay for security that can be used to stop them. After the job is done, the rest of the pay is divvied up and the Hitters pay an upkeep for their abilities (called assets) to reflect the work they do on downtime to stay in shape.<br/><br/>Injury to Hitters raises their debt toward a credit limit created by the Boss's investment in you. If a Hitter exceeds that limit, they are worth more dead than alive and become a target themselves.<br/><br/>A campaign follows the life of the Hitters as they try to earn enough money to buy their way out of the business before they outlive their usefulness.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82737/#Comment_82737" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-23T13:52:32+00:00" title="July 23, 2007  1:52PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This and Misspent Youth are my 2 favorite games of 2007. Contract Work has so much amazing potential.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you like the Shadowrun or Cyberpunk settings or style of play but dislike their rules? Contract Work would make the perfect Shadowrun game (and I've played Shadowrun for 10+ years).<br/>\n<br/>\nI love how almost everything is measured in terms of money. I love how legwork matters. I love how you can play the game in flashbacks as you are being interviewed by an interrogator (although who is the interrogator... your mob boss, the police after you screwed up, someone else? I don't know. But we will find out!!!). I love how you have money to spend on you assignments but you get to keep what you don't spend. I love how you may win, but lose as you go farther and farther into debt. I love how you gain liability traits. I love how you have to maintain your assets. I love this game!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt rocks! I am seriously excited and highly anticipating this game's release. And I'm glad Russell is taking his time to make this game just right.<br/>\n<br/>\nAwesome!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83001/#Comment_83001" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-24T13:26:08+00:00" title="July 24, 2007  1:26PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 24, 2007 2:54PM by eruditus.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John said it perfectly in every way.<br><br><i>Editted to hide my stupidity.</i><br><br>Thanks for running it!

Apparently story-games became a hard-core pr0n site in the past two days, because my office is blocking the site.<br><br>Anyway . . .<br><br>Jenskot: Yes. I am generally irritated by Cyberpunk. The lack of shared activity between players, the clunky humanity rules, and the slide into anime of the recent edition. I've tried to play Shadowrun and the "everything all the time" rules crunch broke me. Contract Work started as a Cyberpunk heartbreaker, but even that seemed too complex so I figured I'd start small, without the AIs, robot limbs and self firing guns. One day I hope to go back to that Cyberpunk game. Maybe as a supplement to Contract Work that you could co-author. Eh?<br><br/>Edits: Some of the rules are up on that same blog in much earlier entries but they have evolved a good deal since then (I may have pulled them down because of the inaccuracies. I'd check but I have to be somewhere soon.) So here is a brief overview of the resolution mechanic.\n<ul>\n<li>Players are created in a point-buy system with Assets. These are the tools and talents to get the job done. Those Assets tell us the value of their target and the money (resources) for both sides. <br/><br/></li><li>With only half the money of the target, the Hitters can't charge in to kill him. They must make him spend money first and wear him down. To do this, Hitters collect Preparations (I know the pass code to his security system; I know where he meets his mistress; etc.) through confrontations. In confrontations, Hitters wager money in a bid system. <br/><br/></li><li>Hitter bids amount, Interrogator must match and may raise (up to twice the original bid,) Hitter may then match again or stay. Hitter declares an Asset at risk whose value is added to the pool, Interrogator adds the generic Asset of the Target and may add a Token to boost his side by a few points. <br/><br/></li><li>The bid numbers are tallied (1 pt. per Asset value, 1 pt. per $100) and each side divides their numbers in secret on an index card between Attack and Defense (how bad you want to win vs. how cautious you are.) There are some limitations on how the Interrogator must bid if the Hitters are acting covertly.<br/><br/></li><li>Cards are revealed. H's Attack higher than I's Defense earns the Hitters a Preparation valued at the Interrogator's expenses. The reverse is damage to the Hitter's Asset at risk. Both sides could hit each other if neither defends well enough, or both could cancel each other out if they don't attack hard enough. Ties are broken with a nominal fee. Dice may be rolled to boost the Hitter's side but the Interrogator gets tokens to use later.<br/><br/></li><li>Attacking the Target is similar, except the Hitters use only the pts. of Preparations they earned instead of cash and directly attack the Target's "HP."<br/><br/></li><li>The Target can strike back with his own attacks against the Preparations of the Hitters, lowering their value if successful. Use it or lose it.</li>\n</ul>\nThat's it in a nutshell.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83611/#Comment_83611" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-27T07:01:41+00:00" title="July 27, 2007  7:01AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I enjoyed this game quite a bit.<br/><br/>Russell, how do you manage--if you do at all--"overly" cooperative murderers?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Russell_Collins" title="Russell_Collins"><img alt="Russell_Collins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.clockworkaudio.net/images/russfacesmall.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Russell_Collins">Russell_Collins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88190/#Comment_88190" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-15T10:41:07+00:00" title="August 15, 2007 10:41AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>I enjoyed this game quite a bit.<br/><br/>Russell, how do you manage--if you do at all--"overly" cooperative murderers?</blockquote>\nAgain, sorry for so late a reply.<br/><br/>Anyone who doesn't pull their weight (use all their action tokens) gives money from the payoff to the ones who did. Also, If a Hitter goes over their credit limit, they are a new Target assigned to one of the other players at the table.
