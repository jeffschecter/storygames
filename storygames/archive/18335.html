I think this is an oft left out skill for your toolbox. <b><i>Show, not tell</i></b>.<br/><br/>The difference between the two needs defining:  'telling' is the reliance on simple exposition... <br/> <i>Rolfball is an old man</i> <br/>'Showing,' conversely, is the use of evocative prose, not necessarily wordy exposition, but evocative of your setting / characters / scene / intent. <br/><i>Rolfball shuffles slowly toward you, his angry, broken form consoled by an achingly dark heartwood cane, gripped by swollen-jointed hands;  translucent and liver-spotted.</i>.<br/><br/>Both showing and telling convey the same information \u2014 Rolfball <i><b>is</b></i> old \u2014 but the first bit of description simply states it, whereas the latter never actually states that Rolfball is ancient at all, and yet nonetheless tells the group that he is 'old' and ends up opening all sorts of provacative questions for the game.<br/><br/>Why is 'showing' with your descriptions better?  First, you are fueling mental imagery for your roleplaying friends. Second, showing is interactive and participatory: it forces the group to become involved in the story, inferring facts (such as Rolfball's age, status and intent) rather than just taking your narration in passively.<br/><br/>So my hints for barfing forth would be to show the scarcity, in all that you narrate, evoke the paradigm that <i>there is no status quo</i> in Apocalypse World by showing your players rather than just telling them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/VIM40" title="VIM40"><img alt="VIM40" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/VIM40">VIM40</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413622/#Comment_413622" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-06T09:33:03+00:00" title="May  6, 2013  9:33AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These are great, descriptions as well as solid advice.

What happens when [some typical everyday occurence] takes place? How do people react in a way which shows us how much the world has changed?<br/><br/>Someone ran an AW game where the apocalypse was caused by some kind of plague. In that world, people might be carefully segregated into the "clean" and the "unclean", forced to sit downwind from one another, work together but sleep in different sides of the river, and so on.<br/><br/>And whatever you come up with, emphasize it only if a) the players find it interesting and investigate further, or b) it applies directly to a character's goals or one of your Fronts.<br/><br/>Edit: I also think it's a good idea to take a cue from Vincent's rather spare sprinkling of imagery in the book itself. There is no careful description: just a scarcity of important details. E.g. "Armour made out of old Stop signs riveted together." "Feral dogs with bone eyelids that go click-click-click." etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
