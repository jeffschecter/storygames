When I got home tonight, I had a chance to look over everything...and was quite underwhelmed.<br/><br/>For the large part, they were D&amp;D or D&amp;D-esque short adventure modules (Castles &amp; Crusades, Dungeon Crawl Classics, Pathfinder, etc.), with a few introductions and quickstarts (for Shadowrun/Battletech, Cosmic Patrol, Conspiracy X, and the newest installment of FFGs WH4K rpg).<br/><br/>Most exceptional of the lot was a big map for Harn...but since I don't play Harn, it was about as useful to me as the rest of the lot.<br/><br/>It got me thinking about what a waste it all was. Within the same confines of one of those sample modules, an indie game designer could fit a complete and fulfilling game! Heck, +Nathan Paoletta's Vesna Thaw or Be Ashamed Young Prince are all lighter-weight than most of the Free RPG Day goods, and have a thousand times more replay value!<br/><br/>So, I'm thinking that in preparation of the next Free RPG Day, local indie game designers should put together samplings of games to distribute too! Probably not an original thought. Probably there are some indie gamers that are already doing so in their areas...but around my area (PDX), I didn't see any such thing, and I know we have a lot of seasoned and up-and-coming game designers.<br/><br/>I'm not saying it needs to be some huge investment on our parts. Look at how much space some of our games actually take up - a lot of the Game Chef and micro-games are sometimes no more than four or five pages. Simple but presentable little pamphlets, booklets, or even brochures could be made for not too much money.<br/>I'm also not saying we should give away some our marketable products for free, either. It could be a bare-bones version of one of our games. Maybe a game made specifically for the purpose of Free RPG Day. For my area's <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23GoPlayPDXWest&amp;Mode=like">#GoPlayPDXWest</a> events, I had been trying to brainstorm minigames that I could print on postcards that would serve as adverts for game events, as well as being playable games in their own right.<br/><br/>I think we, the indie game crowd, could turn Free RPG Day from a "oh, look. A mini-adventure for I game I don't own" or "oh, look. A quickstart for a game they want me to spend $XX on in order to get full playability", into a day where people get a bunch of small games that are completely self-encompassed and ready to play as soon as the customer has had a chance to glance over it.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382580/#Comment_382580" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-17T14:03:43+00:00" title="June 17, 2012  2:03PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I could definitely see potential in this.

You could have three or four designers pitch in together on a combined flyer, splitting the cost.\n<blockquote> If there was a way to ship a PDF to vendors and have them print whatever they need (or find a way to give away the digital) it'd be a breeze to participate.</blockquote>\nThat may work in some areas. It's also possible to partner with designers who work at print shops, to try and get better deals on printing.<br/>Like for my area, I already print off innumerable copies of the games I've made (sometimes just as playtest drafts), because I work at a print shop and get to keep the leftover paper from jobs for other clients. It actually stacks up rather fast, so lately I've been offering to print stuff for my fellow gamers, something Joel Shempert could attest to (by the way Joel, I do have all of your cards printed and cut out...but you're gonna need to sort 'em).<br/>I'm not saying this is always a possibilty for every area, but its worth looking into.\n<blockquote>As it is there's no way I can justify a whole lot of free printing that's going to get buried under D&amp;D material though.</blockquote>\nIt doesn't even have to be that many, or that big of an investment. Say, ten copies of your game, printed in black &amp; white, per shop where you want to distribute. And if there's two or three or four designers doing this, it would start to stand out.<br/><br/>I had noticed that my FLGS maybe had only twenty each of the free stuff, at most, (and I went early, too), so having two or three selections of indie games of ten copies each would probably catch some eyes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382588/#Comment_382588" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-17T14:52:02+00:00" title="June 17, 2012  2:52PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Maybe it comes down to us.

Personally, I couldn't give a crap about the D&amp;D stuff that gets put out on FRPGD. I have yet to see anything much that's of any value to me, with the sole exception of that bonus bestiary that Paizo put out the year Pathfinder came out. That was pretty boss. But anyway, yeah, each store gets a package of stuff that companies put up, but they have to pay for it. That's why a LFGS or three around me never participate - they aren't generating sales with it and thereby recouping their losses. At least in dealing with stores themselves, you could bypass the bullshit requirements for FRPGD products, like their logo has to be on it, it needs a minimum of 16 pages, and PDF and print versions of it can't have been available until AFTER FRPGD...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382619/#Comment_382619" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-17T21:04:41+00:00" title="June 17, 2012  9:04PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Free RPG Day bundle is relatively easy to get into, if you want to print several thousand copies that meet their specifications.<br/><br/>For my part, I just offered to run a demo table during the event and my local store was glad to have me.

I completely neglected in specifying that.<br/>I know that my FLGS, and probably two or three others in the PDX area would probably be quite friendly to local indie gamers bringing along freebie games, both for distribution and demos, during Free RPG Day. Particularly considering how much they gripe about the cost and hassle of the "official" stuff. (apparently the guy who distributes the materials locally is an unpleasant person...but that's neither here nor there).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
