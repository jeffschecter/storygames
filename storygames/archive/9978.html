It details a huge world, and all sorts of character types, from scientists, to investigators, to mecha pilots, to half-demons.  You really have to decide before-hand what type of game you want to play with it, and make sure that all your players are on board.  If one player expects to play a shoot-'em-up mecha game, and everyone else expects to play conspiratorial horror, you'll have a problem on your hands.<br/><br/>The dice mechanic is a little strange as well.  It's pool based, so you roll a number of d10s based on your skill, take the highest result, and add it to the skill's associated attribute.  However, if you roll doubles/triples/etc, you can add those together instead of the highest roll.  Or if you roll a straight, you can add those together.  I'm not sure how well it works in play, but I imagine after doing it for a while it would quickly become second nature.<br/><br/>As Nathan says above, it IS pretty traditional, along the lines of WoD.  Not too much about it is "story gamey."   The one thing it does do well is marries Lovecraftian horror and mecha anime tropes into a really cool setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221565/#Comment_221565" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-30T02:50:37+00:00" title="July 30, 2009  2:50AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: veritascitor</cite>The dice mechanic is a little strange as well.

Turns out this dice method actually generates quite a smoothe progression from low levels of ability to high ones, with each successive level giving an increase only slightly less than the preceding ones. Compared to a standard die pool system, you get slightly more benefit at higher levels of ability, but without any inconvenient hiccups in the line.<br/><br/>So basically, it's a good dice system from the point of view of statistics, although players may initially take a while to get used to milking the best out of it.<br/><br/>In other respects, I've always described it as 'Manga Cthulhu'. It's too over-the-top and in-your-face for the regular mythos atmosphere of lurking dread, so it's best not to approach it expecting Call of Cthulhu in space. And try to ignore the Nazadi, they're just lame elf-equivalents and really don't fit in at all.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221568/#Comment_221568" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-30T03:05:59+00:00" title="July 30, 2009  3:05AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought the concept was ace, so I got the game in my excitement in Black and White for 50% off.<br/><br/>Reading it made me go, "Bland, bland, bland, but beautiful art-work in parts, shame it's the black and white version."<br/><br/>This book wasn't really meant to be sold in black and white, but when I said "Bland" above?

The drama dice which you can add or substract from any roll are nice and about as "innovative" as it gets. We at least played it so that these were pretty meta in that your character didn't have to be at the scene for you to hand these out. Worked really well to involve players in scenes where their characters aren't present. For example, two of the groups gun-men faced of against a particularly nasty night-gaunt on top of an unfinished skyscraper with the rest of the group on the ground level and the entire party pumped out almost all of their drama dice into the encounter so the guys up there could triumph.<br/><br/>The dice mechanic is cool (except for the abysmal critical failure rule, which states that if half of your dice come up as ones, you critically fail - consider that you roll from 1-5 dice usually, so starting skills are very dangerous and actually get more likely to critically fail as you jump from skill 1 to skill 2), the system is relatively smooth (except for the clunky and harsh death-spiral). So, it works good, but doesn't blow your mind.<br/><br/>The world is very much Manga Cthulhu, but I'm liking it. It adds para-psychics (superpowered mutants) into the Mythos mix. Also, the Migou-made Nazzadi race of black skinned enemies-of-mankind-turned-allies is present and divides opinion. I didn't like them at first, but they grew onto me. The totalitarian New Earth Government is also a big factor, but I think I've turned up the grimmer aspects of that up a bit from the setting, which presents a rather mono-cultural and rather unified view of mankind. Not that my NEG is entirely divided and fracticious, but my portrayal of it at least raises some questions.<br/><br/>It was already stated as well, but you really need to decide on what parts of the game to focus on. If you in full-blown trad-style just throw the book out and let people pick what they want to play, it would be a disaster. The game book doesn't quite make this as clear as it should in my view.<br/><br/>The very traditional and lack-luster sanity mechanics were disappointing, though admittedly we had fun with them in my last game. For my new game I'm tinkering with something more resembling Trail of Cthulhu.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221589/#Comment_221589" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-30T05:59:47+00:00" title="July 30, 2009  5:59AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have played in a CT campaign, it sort of faded away after five sessions, rather than ended properly.

The art is great.<br/><br/>The setting is ok, Mythos with mecha combat as the others have said. But if you want the mecha part you would have to play a military style game.

The game then fell apart because of dissatisfaction with the system and it's clunkiness, as well as problems with the setting when I got under the hood.  <br/><br/>The system is uses a standard Attribute/Skill stat build for characters, but with the concepts there a little switched up and unintuitive.  Character attributes give you a flat bonus to any roll with that Attribute, while skills give you the number of dice that you're going to roll.  If you've played any of the DP9 games (Tribe 8, Heavy Gear, Jovian Chronicles), think that.  <br/><br/>As for those rolls, they're based on Gin Rummy, but with d10s.  You roll a number of dice equal to your skill, add up and matching dice or dice that run in a row (like dice that came up 7, 8, and 9), and compare to a difficulty.  Kind of fun once it gets going, but you won't actually use these mechanics for most of the first couple of sessions.  Most characters will only be rolling two or three dice, with maybe four or five in their core skills.  <br/><br/>You can increase the number of dice that you roll with drama points, a spendable bennie with your standard hand-wavey, terrible reward mechanic strapped on to them.  You spend them whenever you want, each point buying you an extra die to roll, but you only get them back if the GM likes what you did with them.  Actually, as I recall, the exact phrasing is that you couldn't use them in "stupid" ways.  Also, there were no good, solid benchmarks to tell you how many drama points to reward.  <br/><br/>With a name like CthulhuTech, and my deep and abiding love of all things Mecha, I wanted some mecha combat.  And you... kinda get some.  There are pre-built mecha, built for the setting, but no mecha creation system.  As for those mecha stats, they're silhouettes that sort of click over your character and make his stats into mecha stats.  This is a common application in a lot of games with mecha in them, so I wasn't terribly surprised there.  The silhouette isn't terrible intuitive, with lots of skills and character stats getting their names changed for their mecha versions.  I often had to help my players figure out what dice to roll because of that.  Also, each mecha had certain components to keep track of during combat, each of which could get destroyed in a fight.  Things like infrared scanners and communications arrays.  As your mech takes more damage, you lose the use of more of these items.  A cool idea, but one hampered by a damage system that frustrates.  <br/><br/>Finally, combat is slow and dull, which a game with giant robots fighting monsters from the Cthulhu mythos should not be.  The worst part of it is probably that as a player, I could see many spots in the design that they could have streamlined.  From seperate initiative, attack, defense, and damage rolls, to a damage system that exemplifies the concept of "death spiral".  <br/><br/>As for the setting, it is interesting.  Far too detailed for my tastes, with an obvious inspiration taken from White Wolf's metaplots.  CthulhuTech is meant to have an evolving metaplot, related through sourcebooks and, I think, a couple of collections of short stories.  This might be to some players tastes, but it is definitely not to mine.  Also, the presentation of the setting's history is a little convoluted.  <br/><br/>But the IDEAS!  Giant robots with biology inside of them stolen from mythos monsters.  People that can transform into Kamen-Rider-via-Mythos monsters. <br/><br/>I'll be frank, I didn't enjoy playing the game.  After a couple of sessions of play, my gaming group wound up just gutting the concepts and switching over to a different system.  If you could find a cheaper copy of the book, especially the colour edition, I'd say pick that up.  Or, better yet, find a copy of the PDF for cheap and data mine the hell out of it for ideas, then pick a system that you like and get to work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221641/#Comment_221641" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-30T09:47:02+00:00" title="July 30, 2009  9:47AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have the book and have browsed through it and totally grooved on the setting.
