Post-internet, I don't think anyone out there is going to follow the footsteps of people back in the pre-internet days, and not do any research into what's out there.<br/><br/>Frex, I'd say games like Chronicles of Ramlar, Sovereign Stone, Epic, Desolation, Riddle of Steel(!), Zir'An and the like all look the same to a degree, in the sense of generic(ish) western fantasy in a "stats and skills" core system with a quirk or two. But I don't think that all the factors line up in the same way that the Heartbreakers did. Taking a look at the Heartbreaker (according to Ron)'s definition:<br/><br/>#  Has been developed by someone with no real experience of games outside a single system, generally<br/># This system is (often) DnD<br/># The author thinks to have created the end-all-be-all game that fixes all the "broken stuff" in the system he knows, generally reinventing the wheel and rediscovering stuff that has been common in other games for years ("My game has no classes, and no levels, wooot!").<br/># The game (And that is the critical part) contains at least one or two really good ideas, buried under all the other stuff.<br/># The author, not knowing any better, pours TONS of money in the project, printing thousands of copies that will have no market whatsoever.<br/><br/>So, numbers 3 and 5... simply aren't there.  <br/><br/>5: People might make BAD business decisions or whatever, but in all these new "sort of same looking" western fantasy games, I don't think anyone lost their shirts.<br/><br/>And the main one that seperates it in my mind, is:<br/>3: In all these games, it seems that the creators ARE aware of more than D&amp;D. Reading some of the websites, the designers talk about how they played X, Y and Z... They return to western fantasy, with a combat-focused game, and a system of everyman skills and stats (in some case, the 6 D&amp;D stats just revised a little), but it seems that these new games aren't actively reinventing the wheel, but rather crafting stuff to aim more towards what they want. It might look and smell to us like Yet Another D&amp;D Clone, but I do believe these folks have played more than one game and know more than one game: Most of the classic Heartbreakers were based off the knowledge and play of one, single game.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166133/#Comment_166133" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-29T12:49:28+00:00" title="August 29, 2008 12:49PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, for me, more important that the concept of "Fantasy Heartbreaker" is the concept of what I'd call a "Publishing Heartbreaker". Basically the folks who, in this day and age, still think the only way to make a game is to print up 5,000 copies of a shiny art-filled core book and dump them into traditional distro. The last decade is littered with the corpses of those who did this and died. Post 2000, there's no reason that your game can't be in print indefinitely (if you want to never see your game again, you can post it to Lulu and have people pay a premium to have it printed up and shipped to them).<br/><br/>The ones that stand out in my memory are:<br/><br/>Cold Steel Reign.  In 2005 they had a $4000+ booth at Origins, selling their HUGE corebook (as well as dice bags, flasks, T-shirts, etc), and having an iron-strong web presense. Cut to 18 months later, and it has so fallen off the map it burned a hole through the parchment. You can't even find a character sheet online anymore, not even with the Wayback Machine (a quickstart is still available through Wayback, though). It's like agents from the future destroyed their presence in order to stop the apocalypse or something.<br/><br/>Closer to my heart:<br/>EDIT: I was writing a long speech about a game I loved called The End which has been effectively dead for years (even after it came back in 2002 in an excellent d20 edition), but after aggressive searching I found it (about about 15 minutes of looking) in a corner of RPGNow. It actually doesn't come up in searches for "The End", I had to look it up by the company name Tyranny Games. Anyway, looks like that one is still available so my point here failed.

That's not to say its not a bad game, but it is very old skool AD&amp;D-ish, with only a few changes that I think separate the two games (a narrative/point system for good and evil rather than alignments, the ability to spend stamina points to gain bonuses or extra actions, a "bleed" system which allows both characters to fight after their hit points have been exhausted or to bypass HP to do a quick kill, etc.)<br/><br/>Then again, those changes might move it out of the FH definition, and the creators seem to be doing well with the game.

The idea was a lot of the people out there with homebrew campaigns tried to publish them as full games, and really they were just a retread of D&amp;D. I think the "hearbreaker" sense was people wanted them to be something more and they weren't. Doesn't mean they were bad game, just design wise they covered a lot of well-traveled ground.<br/><br/>Again, thats not a bad thing. I mentioned Sundrah earlier, and it is a good game. It is just really, really familiar. If someone wanted to play old AD&amp;D, I would tell them to check out Sundrah, because it has a lot of the same feel but is better.<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166165/#Comment_166165" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-29T16:10:05+00:00" title="August 29, 2008  4:10PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Jon">@Jon</a>: also, you demonstrate the third most common use of the internet[*]: post offended in a thread without reading the first 2 or 3 posts, which contain your answer.<br/><br/>[*] Dunno 'bout the second, but the first is ovbiously pr0n<br/>Remember rule 34                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166172/#Comment_166172" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-29T16:46:42+00:00" title="August 29, 2008  4:46PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My reading of Ron's original essays was that the heartbreaker component was the original idea or mechanic in each one, that actually DID offer something substantially new and cool, but which was nerfed or obscured in execution, because the game designer(s) felt the need to hew so strongly to the D&amp;D; model (either through lack of confidence or lack of knowledge).  And I don't think it was originally intended to be derogatory, although it has come be used that way in practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, I think that Burning Wheel Classic can be viewed a Fantasy Heartbreaker in the original sense, because much of what is the beating heart of the game we know today was buried in the back amidst weasel words of Luke going "yeah, this Artha thing is probably too weird, but I really like it".  The difference between BW and the others is that a) Luke Crane is m-f-king wolverine of self publishing and b) Luke found a community that said "hey, we like your freaky shit, the solution is not to hide it, the solution is to take it to its logical conclusion."<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the intention of the original essays was not to heap scorn on the games mentioned, but to say "hey, there's real idea gold buried away in these things you might just dismiss as Yet Another D&amp;D; Retread".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166183/#Comment_166183" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-29T17:46:11+00:00" title="August 29, 2008  5:46PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll still stand behind Ramlar as a fantasy heartbreaker, though I realize the author has probably experienced more than one game system. In fact, he wrote a pretty cool game (Zero) before Ramlar. But Ramlar does promise to fix all the wrongs of your favorite fantasy role-playing game. And that Larry Elmore cover could not have been cheap.<br><br>And, on a browse of the rules, it did have some interesting ideas but it also looked like a total rehash of D&amp;D and other old-gen RPGs in a very derivative way -- doing things because everyone does them, without real thought about what those things accomplish.

Interestingly, the game may have redeemed itself from Heartbreaker status by being redistributed in free digital form, since that's the sort of model encouraged by the original essays.<br><br>For myself, I don't think "Fantasy Heartbreaker" was ever intended as an insult. The point of the original essays was that these games' main failing was trying to emulate the publishing scheme of D&amp;D (which doesn't work so well when you have thousands of dollars to TSR/WotC/Hasbro's millions) and that they were worthwhile in many ways.
