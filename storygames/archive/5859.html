That's actually proved to be beneficial, as the mechanical aspects of the game have undergone some change since then. This would be an opportunity to see how those changes actually affect play.<br/><br/>For those not familiar with Hot War, there's a bunch of information available on the <a href="http://www.contestedground.co.uk/forum/index.php?c=12" rel="nofollow">CGS forums</a>, including some stuff that directly relates to <a href="http://www.contestedground.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1628" rel="nofollow">the background and what I see the game as being about</a>.<br/><br/>One of the players, Blair, was coming into this totally cold, so he had something of a disadvantage from the start. Both Morgue and Steve had been part of the game and character creation process, whereas Blair had to adapt to the character that was handed to him, with much less knowledge of the setting elements than the rest of this. However, he did do an admirable job.<br/><br/>The real stress on this evenings play was to give the conflict mechanics a real booting to see how they held up. The changes that have taken place from the almost straight port of the Cold City mechanics to the current iteration of Hot War have been quite substantial, altering the tone and themes of the game radically. Cold War is all about the decay in trust, Hot War is about building relationships in the aftermath of the apocalypse. An important difference.<br/><br/>So, it was conflict ahoy, almost from the get go. If this were a BBC drama (which is the tone that we chose to set at the start), we would have got about fifteen minutes into the programme during this evenings play. As a bit of backstory, the characters are going undercover in Battersea to root out a corrupt, venal local politician who is attempting to set up a power base for himself in defiance of the Government. The characters find themselves in a work gang, being forced to hand over their ration cards because "That's the bosses orders, see?"<br/><br/>Conflict ran good and hard and it was nice to see that the GMs power of framing scenes didn't cause a diminishment of the contribution from the players. They took the scene and ran with it, playing things out to conflict. The opening scene moved nicely into a fairly harsh section, where in an interior scene in a dilapidated terraced house, some French refugees are found and driven out (the characters and other having been seconded from the work gang for this task) and multiple conflicts regarding their fate and the standing of the characters in the eyes of their fellows grew out of this.<br/><br/>These scenes helped establish the brutal nature of the regime in Battersea and how far the characters were willing to go in order to keep their cover and get in deeper. Neames was on the verge of administering a beating to the adult refugees with a pickaxe handle, Perkins whacked the work gang leader across the back of the head and Beaumont was attempting to be a force for order and calm amongst it all. We also saw Blair bring in one of Beaumonts hidden agendas (he wants to save as many refufgees as possible and get them to a better life outside of London) to effectively allow the escape of the refugees. <br/><br/>The establishment of character (Neames show to be immersing himself in his cover, Beaumont exuding leadership and establishing himself as a rallying figure for the downtrodden people and Perkins acting without regard to consequences) worked really nicely.<br/><br/>The real value here was in thrashing out some of the flaws that became apparent in the Relationship and Consequence mechanics. it was immediately obvious that the concept of having reciprocal relationships (operating in a manner similar to Trust in Cold City) was flawed and met with problems when relationships were taken as consequences. The conclusion was that relationships should be all about the relationship from the point of the view of the character. If an NPC with whom the character has a relationship has a reciprocal value, then cool. But if not (and there's always the opportunity to establish that in play) then cool.<br/><br/>The second issue was with conflicts and consequences. More conflicts resulted in 2 successes than any other number, so that section of the consequences table came in for some scrutiny. It became apparent that when spending 2 points, there were a lack of viable options for failure, particularly when you were in violent conflict. the addition of a new type of consequence "Temporary (remainder of this scene) negative trait" would be an effective fix here. <br/><br/>Just to note, you trade successes for point to spend on both success and failure consequences. So, with 2 successes, you can buy 2 points of success consequences for yourself, 2 points of failure consequences for the opposition, 1 point for both and so on.<br/><br/>So, in light of this extremely valuable playtest, there are going to be some changes to the text! Relationships will undergo change in light of our experience with them and consequences mildly revised to make them more applicable to more situations. <br/><br/>I hope that Blair, Morgue and Steve might chip in with some of their thoughts on tonights game at some point.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131141/#Comment_131141" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T07:01:58+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  7:01AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2008 7:02AM by Graham.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hot War is looking very strong.

The bit about the photographs is something of an evolution of a bit in the Cold City Companion. In the original version, each player described a scene they would like to see in the game as it progressed. During the very first playtest, either Steve or Morgue (I can't recall exactly which) suggested that instead of describing a scene, the player should describe a B&amp;W snapshot of a scene. A frozen moment in grainy, monotone time. It seems to have worked well so far and I'm glad it's something you've enjoyed as part of the game creation process.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: morgue</cite>It was a poppin' good game.

I'll need to integrate a version of those words into the text somehow, because I think they offer really great guidance and a viewpoint that isn't quite in there yet. That was one of the really positive things that came out of the game last night. I'm really looking forward to continuing it next week.<br/><br/>Using your example of knocking the guard unconscious, I (as GM) wouldn't have a problem with that. The being knocked out part doesn't fundamentally alter the character. It is, as you point out, the consequences stem from what happened, but it's the naration that represents the actual results of the conflict, even though consequences are connected to this.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131829/#Comment_131829" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T20:45:24+00:00" title="February 29, 2008  8:45PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few thoughts occurred to me after the game:<br/>\n<br/>\nConflicts are the only way to improve.

They found themselves hauled in from of 'The Boss', a former petty councillor, now puffed up on his own sense of importance and his attempts to create his own fiefdom through fear and brutality.<br><br>The scene in the dilapidated Council Buildings not only established that the current ruler of Battersea was attempt to use existing trappings of power for his own advantage, but also served to introduce the Boss and his right hand man, a former policeman slightly known to Neames, one of the PCs. We also saw a scene in the abandoned underground railway tunnels, where the ill-equipped PCs were sent by a vengeful Boss in order to try and find evidence of some unspecified 'beast'. We also saw the introduction of Dr Wilkinson, an NPC created during the collaborative game creation phase, who was requested as a foil for the evil that the Boss and his henchmen represented.<br><br>The final scenes took place amongst old warehouses and buildings near the power station, where a hunt was going on to root out refugees and people living illegally in Battersea. This scene was not dwellt upon, as we didn't want to have a simple repetition of scenes from the previous session. <br><br>Two really important things came out of tonights play:<br/><br/>1) Conflicts with multiple particpants.<br/><br/>We decided that, in the case of conflicts with multiple participants, but where the various people are not co-operating, the current rules text needed clarification and expansion. This is a rough first draft of the additional text:<br/><br/><em>However, there may also be times when there are multiple particpants in a conflict, with no co-operation between the sides. If this is the case, the victor is the defined as the particpant who beats every other person involved. Once the victor has been decided, the level of success (and therefore the number of consequence points that can be allocated) is determined by deciding who the victor was in adversity with and seeing how many successes they had against them. If the victor was in adversity with more than one particpant, then the number of successes is determined by seeing who they achieved the most succeses against.<br/><br/>The victor then has the right to tell the story of what happened in the conflict and spend consequence points as they see fit. </em><br/><br/>2) The role and use of positive and negative relationships:<br/><br/>We talked a bit about how they were used and how they could be better used. After the discussions, this is pretty much what I wrote:<br/><br/><em>With a positive relationship, the owner of the relationship always gets first option on using the relationship UNLESS the conflict is with the object of the relationship. If the side with first choice does not choose to use the relationship, then other participants in the conflict may use it.<br/><br/>Example:<br/><br/>Neames has collared Watson, who is on his way to an assignation with a local girl. Debbie decides that she will initiate a conflict, representing the fact that Neames is trying to stop Watson. Joe assembles his dice pool, but choose not to bring in his relationship with Mary Pike, the girl Watson hopes to marry. Debbie decides that she will bring in Watsons positive relationship with Mary Pike. This represents Neames using the relationship to persuade Watson not to jeopardise his chances just to get a one night stand.<br/><br/>With a negative relationship, participants other than the owner of the relationship always get first option on using the relationship UNLESS the conflict is with the object of the relationship. If the side with first choice does not choose to use the relationship, then other participants in the conflict may use it.<br/><br/>Example: <br/><br/>Beaumont is having a set-to with Morely, a bullying work-gang leader who he has built up to a sizeable negative relationship with. Therefore Caroline can decide whether or not to use it to aid Beaumonts chance of beating Morely up, using the anger and resentment represented by the negative relationship.</em><br/><br/>There seemed to be general satisfaction that these were workable solutions to the issues that we had encountered during play. Comments and feedback welcomed as always.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_132586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132586/#Comment_132586" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-05T08:24:14+00:00" title="March  5, 2008  8:24AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent feedback and turnaround, Malcolm.

Where the GM is chucking adversity/challenge in micro amounts, the pics, <i>especially if unexplained</i>, throw challenge at the big level to the GM. <br/><br/>It's like a game of creativity-catch<br/><br/>" Here's a weird creepy image, Mr. GM.

Going into the game I'd looked over the character sheets and noted relationships that had lain unused, some of them pretty powerful and/or important. So I scribbled down a few potential scenes that might get brought into the game. This also helped to structure it in my head, which was pretty handy. All in all, we got through a total of 11 scenes, way more than in previous sessions. Everyone later commented that our feel for the mechanics, the characters and the way the story was going really helped with this.<br/><br/>To cover off the scenes, they broke down like this:<br/><br/>Scenes 1 &amp; 2 involved getting a message from, and then meeting, the 'inside man' who had been mentioned during the game creation phase, but who hadn't yet come into the story. This also drew on the 'B&amp;W photo scene suggestion' from Morgue, which had also lain unused since the game creation phase.<br/><br/>Scenes 3 &amp; 4 revolved around Dupont, the French refugee father whom we met in the very early stages of the first session. He was now back and armed with a shotgun, looking to kill Moreley, the work gang leader who ordered him and his family beaten. Although Moreley was duped into coming outside, Neames (Steves character) intervened and he was then captured. The following scene was one of the most powerful we've yet had, where (again drawing on a 'B&amp;W photo scene suggestion' from the game creation phase), Neames was handed a gun and told to execute Dupont. The scene took place in a dank cellar, with Beaumont, Neames and Perkins all involved and all having to make sacrifices and be complicit in the death of an innocent man.<br/><br/>Scenes 5, 7 &amp; 10 all involved the appearance of Mary Pike, the girl whom Perkins wishes to marry. All of these scenes built the relationship up, through a quest for black market tins of condensed milk and Perkins blurting out to Mary that he is actually a spy of some kind. It's the first time we had met Mary and, had the game been continuing on any further, the story of her relationship with Perkins would certainly have formed a major thread.<br/><br/>Scenes 6 &amp; 6 saw Beaumont being recognised by Lieutenant Commander Barlow, a Navy colleague who arrived in Battersea with a motor gunboat towing a barge, on a mission to collect refugees for the camps in the Thames Estuary. Beaumont was recognised by Barlow, who proceed to ruin Beaumonts good reputation in the eyes of the men of the work gang before bringing him on board the gunboat for a brandy. We then had a flashback scene to the English Channel during the War, when both characters were on a destroyer defending against tentacular leviathans. The conflict that emerged told the story of Barlow using his tiny amount of seniority to force Beaumont and the sailors who respected him to machinegun boatloads of refugees trying to escape to England.<br/><br/>Scene 9 say Neames meet with his brother George in a dingy pub drinking ersatz beer. This is their first meeting in five or six years and George is hostile and suspicious. The main thrust of the situationis to bring this relationship into the story and to involve George in the plans that Neames has for taking revenge. Both of these outcomes were met, and in spades!<br/><br/>The final scene saw the Boss of Battersea wheedling the characters into spying on his wife, who he presumes is having an affair (she most certainly is, and with his chief henchman, Raleigh). The characters emerge from the Town Hall with rifles, now men on the inside of the power structure they are trying to bring down.<br/><br/>As for the mechanical changes to the game, one which was implemented and tried out in this session was removing the existing first level of consequences. Now, there are only three levels of consequences, making it easier to have a more powerful mechanical change to stem from a conflict. Broadly speaking, we agreed that this worked in an ideal fashion and that the evolution of consequences from our first session (and taking into account all the immensely valuable advice and feedback from other playtesters) had worked really well and that this iteration seemed to be an ideal fit.<br/><br/>A major change that stemmed from the post-game discussion related to hidden agendas. Prior to this discussion, agendas could be rated at 5, 9 or 19, meaning that you got to bring them into that number of conflicts before they had to be resolved (they gave different amounts of dice depending on the rating). After much discussion, thought and graph drawing we concluded that the ideal rating should be 3, 5 or 9, coupled with further advice on the use of agendas as a pacing mechanism in the game. Looking at it, this would appear to be good solution.<br/><br/>Overall, another immensely valuable playtest session and one that seems to indicate that the mechanics are reaching a very workable state. I'm sure that there is still polishing required, but the core seems to be very stable.<br/><br/>As this was the final session of Hot War here in Wellington, I'd like to thank Morgue, Blair and Steve for all the effort they have put in, the time they have spent, the feedback they have given and the wonderful good humour they have shown throughout this playtesting.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135240/#Comment_135240" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-17T13:11:38+00:00" title="March 17, 2008  1:11PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Superior officers who order refugees machine-gunned and then turn up again later seems to be a recurring bit of story.

However, it was only during the flashback that we established that he really was a bit of a shit, as opposed to simply being a clueless buffoon.<br/><br/>It was actually the first time that we had a flashback in the game and it worked really well to reinforce the discomfort created by the false cameraderie of Barlow. Sickening twerp that he was. Actually, Blair (one of the players) made the excellent suggestion when he appeared that he and his me would be immaculately turned out and their boat in top shape, in total contrast to everyone else we had ever met in the game, who was worn down, shabby and covered in grime. Worked well.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malc                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135269/#Comment_135269" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-17T16:38:03+00:00" title="March 17, 2008  4:38PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I finish off my playtest on Thursday and looking over the players agendas, if the inhabitants of 'The Square' aren't machine-gunned by the end of the session, I will be stunned.... its the thing to do, obviously!<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135305/#Comment_135305" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-17T22:46:57+00:00" title="March 17, 2008 10:46PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe that should be part of set-up:<br><br>"Which of your characters was involved with killing helpless, panicked people during the war?"                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
