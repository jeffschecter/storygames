Put them here, and maybe someone will find a use for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe door on the street was unmarked. Only a small neon sign in a second story window let people know the location of the bar called Gravity. Up the narrow flight of stairs, you were greeted by the quiet bouncer, a 300-something pound native american woman who never had to break up a single fight in all the time I was there. Nonetheless, the place was the most glorious dive run by a guy with the sleaziest smile you've ever seen beam through blond stubble and a cigarette as he spun trashy 80s technopop on vinyl. After a couple of visits he'd know your favourite song, and Joy Division's <i>She's Lost Control</i> would be played not long after I walked in, whether I'd requested it or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the other dj took over, a gothic punk waif with a penchant for industrial and darkwave, and somebody did get the urge to dance, they had to share the postage stamp of a dance floor with a 1-person table, because there was only enough seating for about a dozen people in the place. The crowd was a mix of overweight goths, punk heavies, and skinny guys with the million-watt stares. Sitting together was a bit pointless, because the music was way too loud to talk to anyone. Nonetheless, 3 people could sit together on a collapsed couch next to the mini-pool table at the back. If you didn't feel like blaming the uneven table or the too-close walls for your lousy play, you could always blame the strobes or the spinning multicoloured lights, none of which were synched to the music. Beyond them, almost all the lighting was blacklight with the occasional flare of a lighter as yet another cigarette made you wonder whether or not a fog machine had been installed for all the smoke. Of course, all of this paled compared to the stage, which dominated the whole place.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike the rest of the bar, it wasn't large, only about the size of a queen-size bed, raised 6 inches off the normal floor, with chicken wire mesh across the front. On it were displayed, not musical acts, but the most bored (and I don't mean boring, but actually bored) fully-clothed BDSM shows, sometimes involving hired performers, and other times involving bar patrons who took to performance out of sheer desperation for something to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's been years since Gravity closed. Rumour has it the owner shut down after the city banned smoking in bars. He refused to run a place where he couldn't smoke his own cigarettes. It was an awful place. I miss it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146320/#Comment_146320" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T21:39:06+00:00" title="May 27, 2008  9:39PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.nr.nps.gov/Red%20Books/71000115.red.pdf" rel="nofollow">It is the only shrine dedicated to a sinner</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson" title="Chris Peterson"><img alt="Chris Peterson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cpeterso.com/html/img/merman-confounded.200x200.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson">Chris Peterson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146326/#Comment_146326" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T22:42:31+00:00" title="May 27, 2008 10:42PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 27, 2008 10:42PM by Chris Peterson.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Underground" rel="nofollow">Seattle Underground</a> is a network of underground passageways and basements in downtown Seattle, Washington, United States that was ground level at the city's origin in the mid-1800s.

Five identical floors in grim post-war Stalinist style - ugly little thin-walled rooms with flaking paint and stained acrylic sheets,  menacing gang showers down the hall, creepy faded murals in the hallways.  The windows open, at least, and every sill is pressed into service as an ersatz refrigerator, lined with tomatoes, cheese, and chunks of meat.  From the barren courtyard, food on ledges provides the only color.  It's a dodgy ten minute walk to the Metro station.  <br><br>Some Russian thugs have all the showers running hot water full blast, making the bathroom into their personal banya.  Their girlfriends sulk in the weirdly well-appointed lobby drinking Fantas and watching television.  The desk clerk, a shaggy-haired college student, tries to roust them but they just sneer.  There's a dining room full of chipped, plastic-covered tables, slightly below street level so that the legs of passers-by parade by at eye level.  The yellowed windows are the only source of light.  The hostel offers a complimentary breakfast of day old bread, dubious sliced meats, and some anonymous Czech powdered orange drink.  Most guests eat from their sills, with the exception of a pair of American tourists slumming and a hard-eyed Moldovan family, whose young son is obsessed with a plastic race car acquired from the neighboring second-hand store.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GeekGirlsRule" title="GeekGirlsRule"><img alt="GeekGirlsRule" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GeekGirlsRule">GeekGirlsRule</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146393/#Comment_146393" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T09:12:23+00:00" title="May 28, 2008  9:12AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a tiny little town on the Olympic Peninsula.

The bridge was built in 1785 with 19 massive supporting arches (three to four stories high) which were filled with extra rooms in what was intended to be a commercial hub and shopping center. However the chambers rapidly began to fill with seeping groundwater, making them unpleasant and unsuitable for the grand businesses situated along the bridge.<br/><br/>These windowless chambers and labyrinths of small rooms were converted into the homes and workshops of the poorest and most deprived people. Sweatshops, dormitories, scum houses and brothels were crammed into over 120 chambers and passages and the place became a den of crime and vice. For somewhere between 50 and 100 years (records are unclear) the place was a blot on the underside of the city until at last the criminals were driven out and the whole place was filled with rocks and stones to prevent reoccupation.<br/><br/>The vaults are open now, and a popular destination for ghost tours, but I think their most fascinating period must be when they were a secret windowless world of crime and vice hidden beneath the genteel shopping street above.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147063/#Comment_147063" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-01T01:22:50+00:00" title="June  1, 2008  1:22AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bistro E in San Francisco:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.sfstation.com/bistro-e-europe-b1480" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.sfstation.com/bistro-e-europe-b1480</a><br/><br/>We picked it out of a phone book, walked in, ordered our supper.

Both Congos, Nigeria, Uganda, Rwanda, the whole catch.  Sure, Uganda is beter than it was (hard to get worse than Idi Amin) and Tanzania is more stable, but that's like saying I'm taller than Verne Troyer.  If I were to set a story in a place half as shockingly horrific as these places actually are, it would be rejected for being over the top.<br/><br/>In Vientaine, capital of Laos, there is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Si_Saket" rel="nofollow">Wat</a>.  It's fairly typical of classic laotian architecture, gilded plaster, five-tiered pagodas, and the like.  What struck me as odd was the shrine where monks would, with great solemnity, reveal the relic within: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TT-33" rel="nofollow">Tokarev</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souphanouvong" rel="nofollow">The Red Prince</a>.  This shrine was operating not only during Souphanovong's life, but during his presidency.  Though egomaniacal, it does not seem in Souphanouvong's character to establish a group of monks to pray over his pistol, and I have difficulty immagining that oppressed peasants would spontaniously offering reverance to an unpopular and savagely brutal leader.  <br/><br/>Also in Vientaine, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pha_That_Luang" rel="nofollow">Pha That Luang</a> is literally down the street from the US Embassy.  My father-in-law claimed he was a monk here an an orphan (though this may have been a language issue: "a Wat" vs. "this Wat.")  According to legend, the Wat must remain standing, and the monks must remain dilligent, or the dragon trapped underneath will escape and cause destruction and misery for the Lao people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
