This offers designers an opportunity to prioritize features, or offer additional context for features, based on the appeals they most want to encourage.</blockquote>\nBut my favorite point is his Subversion appeal, and his commentary about how formalizing it could kill/neuter it, OR it is an as-of-yet unexplored design space:\n<blockquote>Could we imagine a game that even more purposely encourages this sort of appeal -- say, a Matrix-style science-fiction game where glitching actually makes sense in the context of the game world, and interesting glitches get formalized as part of the game rules?</blockquote>\nI post this, mainly, to see what y'all might say to the above; and more largely, to this:\n<blockquote>When designers and developers define games as obstacle courses whose primary purpose is to elicit "fun," we miss out on other kinds of engagement and experience. And when we describe players as if they could be so easily fit into a small handful of categories themselves, not only do we forget that we can intrigue and delight one player on multiple levels, but we run the risk of never reaching the players -- or creating the genres -- that we have yet to discover.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373618/#Comment_373618" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-19T08:23:22+00:00" title="April 19, 2012  8:23AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This hits some points made by a designer from Eve online who spoke at Solmukohta.

Quantifying types of interest and elements of game play that appeal to players is a great place to start.

The fact that you think you've figured out how to beat the system is a pretty overwhelming feeling.<br/><br/>There are many books and "strategy guides" for various games of random chance that are, in essence, "here's how you beat the game by focusing in on the (what appears to be) a glitch" in the game. Things like the martingale betting system. Or systems designed to beat the house when betting on sports games. Or ways to find the "hot" slot machine.<br/><br/>*******<br/><br/>Of course, true exploitable glitches in the casino environment are fully supported by players; back when slot machines paid out real coins instead of tickets, there was a case where a bank of $1 slot machines were accidentally set to a quarter. So you'd put in a dollar, get 4 credits, then cash out 4 $1 coins. Needless to say, that was the most popular bank in the casino, until the casino had to keep re-filling the coin hoppers. They found that glitch pretty quickly.<br/><br/>******<br/><br/>As a relatively current example of a glitch that became baked into the game rules, Zynga's "Cityville" has an interesting case.For those who don't know what this is, it's basically a simple sim-city-ish game of building a city on facebook. <br/><br/> As the story was explained to me...<br/><br/> In theory, all of your buildings that you build in your city SHOULD be connected by being placed next to a road or a sidewalk to gain income from those buildings, but apparently, at some point, a class of the buildings (the "community" type) had a software switch set to off for the road connection check. But noone at Zynga caught this until 10's of millions of players had built cities exploiting this feature. it became too late to turn back to clock when noticed, so it became a feature instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373633/#Comment_373633" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-19T10:06:58+00:00" title="April 19, 2012 10:06AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I recall that CityVille bug, Scott--I seem to recall that I just thought it was a feature, like "hey, I can put all these on a park-like mall area, without junking it up with roads and sidewalks".<br/><br/>I'm not sure, however, about the "appearance" of glitching qualifying as transgression. That's more something in exploration... though I suppose that if it REALLY, REALLY looks to the player like an exploit, the player has a smidgen of moral/personal challenge choice to make (i.e., "OK, I found an exploit: do I want to use it, or play 'pure' to the game rules?").<br/><br/>Heck, any sufficiently complex points-buy system is likely to have all SORTS of such exploits (I'm looking at Hero System's examples of ridiculous uber-characters back in, oh, 4E?). Emergent synergies can be a bitch.; and an insufficiently documented procedure of play could open up angles for glitching the RAW while everyone at the table thinks they are "doing it right" because of prior exposure to "workaround" play (e.g., at a con/demo), of habits from years of playing (ostensibly) similar games, of ingrained Rule-0 expectations, or whatever.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to block; I'm just wondering what can unfold from this, for our purposes (seemed timely, with the Game Chef feedback round in full swing).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373689/#Comment_373689" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-19T14:27:25+00:00" title="April 19, 2012  2:27PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So what I don't like about the article is that the author makes it look like he has identified 5 Appeals. He has done no such thing. He has instead identified 19 appeals, which he's grouped into 5 categories. But the categories themselves have very little meaning, other than as a way to organize the article into fewer chunks.<br/><br/>Construction, for example. Is it Accomplishment? Imagination? Social? Recreation? Subversion? You could argue for any of those categories convincingly. And ultimately, it doesn't matter in the slightest.<br/><br/>What does matter is when you look at, for example, construction of Mona Lisa's face in the plants of FarmVille, as is mentioned in the article. What matters is that the developers made it possible for people to visit each others' farms and not just their own, which allowed the possibility of showing off your work, even art work, as an emergent behavior. That's good stuff to identify and look at - where can you put in opportunities for potential engagement with various appeals, including ones not specifically intended by the initial design.<br/><br/>I like the article. I found some of the appeals in the Recreation category particularly interesting. Mood management, for example, is something not often actively looked at.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373797/#Comment_373797" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-20T07:09:25+00:00" title="April 20, 2012  7:09AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, categories always suck; maybe it's better to think of "The Five" as circles on a Venn diagram, with various degrees of overlap.
