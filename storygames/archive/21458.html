It sees the player assume the roles of characters within Austen-like stories.Vying to reach their goals within the challenges of station and societal rules and expectations. The project is well done, the video presentation is charming and informative, I like the system presented and thus couldn\u2019t resist backing it.<br/>The <b>Keyring RPG</b> manages to put a whole tabletop RPG onto a single key-ring. The game is already done and tested in Sweden, where it got a second edition. The presentation does look interesting and the d6 based system solid. With a more than reasonable price on top I couldn\u2019t resist and backed it.<br/>Next to those you\u2019ll find a new Kickstarter for <b>Spell: The RPG</b>, offering the game with a hardcover book and a really fancy wooden box. It is a project that I got starred for maybe a later pledges..<br/>Then there\u2019s the <b>Trinity: Continuum</b> by Onyx Path, aiming to bringing the Trinity Univers back with a new edition under the Storypath System. While am not yet in for Aeon, I\u2019ve been enticed enough to go for the core book pledge.<br/>Last but not Least there\u2019s <b>Sagas of Midgard</b> an interesting new take on creating a tabletop RPG focusing on north mythology..<br/>Yet, you\u2019ll find other cool projects next to those games. Like the Patreon to support <b>Darker Hue Studios</b>, the creators of <i>Harlem Unbound</i>. Well, or the <b>Revilo Creature Collection</b> which should make a really nice looking source to draw monsters. Am as well fascinated by <b>Dungeon Solitaire</b>, which is a card based (solo) dungeon crawling game. Or the <b>CRYPTEX </b>.. a \u201ewooden dice box enigma\u201c-thingy. There are many more cool projects, just take a look:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>5 Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Supplements<br/>2 Adventures<br/>4 Dice &amp; Coin Projects<br/>2 Dice Accessoires<br/>1 RPG Publisher<br/>4 Terrains &amp; Tiles<br/>3 Game Mats<br/>6 Various RPG Projects<br/>4 Other Games<br/><br/><b>Link: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2018/02/04/crowdfunding-collection-67/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2018/02/04/crowdfunding-collection-67/</a></b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teylen" title="Teylen"><img alt="Teylen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teylen">Teylen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469945/#Comment_469945" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-12T15:10:55+00:00" title="February 12, 2018  3:10PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I present to you the new <b><a href="https://teylen.blog/2018/02/12/crowdfunding-collection-68/" rel="nofollow">Crowdfunding Collection No. 68, including every tabletop project started between 02.04. till 02.12.</a></b><br/><br/>Within the collection you\u2019ll find a PbtA game called <b>Vagabonds of Dyfed</b>. The games combines various mechanics inspired by games like Fate, Blades in the Dark and more, to create an OSR gaming experience. Which sounds interesting. Then there\u2019s <b>Age of \xc6ther</b> combing the Age of Enlightenment with the Industrial Revolution to create a Steampunk Fantasy Setting. Which is supported by a newly developed pool based system. Well, and then there is <b>Quest</b>, which pitches the survivors of a world spanning war against aliens intruders and features a d6 based system. If you are a Fan of Savage Worlds Fans you might like to take a look at <b>Kung Fu Animals</b> \u2013 it sounds and looks fun.<br/>Though my personal enthusiasm is focused on <b>Strongholds &amp; Streaming</b>. A book which will help you integrate the titular strongholds \u2013 which might be temples and other stuff \u2013 into your D&amp;D5E campaign. Plus you\u2019ll support the newest streaming project of Matthew Colville. Well, and you can get gemstone dragons. Am so in\u2026 as are many people. Elevating the project to the second most successful tabletop RPG KS!<br/>Yet am at least a bit intrigued by <b>Limitless Encounters 2</b> as well. It looks well and the concept is cool. Last but not least there\u2019s <b>Page Quest: Season 1</b>. Which, as I have to admit, might be more a boardgame (dungeon crawler) than a tabletop rpg, yet am curious..<br/>Next to those projects you\u2019ll find plenty of supplements, adventures, dice stuff and more, just take a look:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>4 Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Solo-Adventuregame<br/>1 Setting<br/>3 Supplements<br/>2 Adventures<br/>1 Dice Project<br/>2 Dice Accesoires<br/>1 Soundscape<br/>3 Various RPG Projects<br/>2 Play Mats<br/>2 Tokens &amp; Minis<br/>2 Other Games<br/><br/><b>Spanish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/><br/>Link: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2018/02/12/crowdfunding-collection-68/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2018/02/12/crowdfunding-collection-68/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469946/#Comment_469946" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-12T15:55:31+00:00" title="February 12, 2018  3:55PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you so much Teylen!

I\u2019ve been in love with their previous Kickstarters like Mecha &amp; Kajius and Tiny Fantasy and are up and ready to take it post-apocalyptic. Thus I backed and do recommend it. <b>Bodycount</b> on the other hand, a cyber punk/space punk rpg, did look a bit sparse on infos on first sight. Yet after having enjoyed the fun, australian-flavored video I am quite enticed and tempted. As it does remind me a bit of the humor of Tank Girl.<br/>In regards of story game the most notable, in my opinion, is the funding of the second edition of <b>Summerland</b>. The game system changed to Open D6, yet should keep a narrative focus and the setting in which characters face their traumata. <b>The Princess Bride RPG</b> on the other hand is more lighthearted, offering the players to indulge into the inconcivable adventures and settings of the cult movie (and to a degree the book). The game uses Fudge and is developed by the creator of the system. Then there is <b>H. P. Lovecraft Preparatory Academy</b> offering a more fun than horror approach to the Cthulhu-Mythos utilizing a system based on PDQ#. Well, and if you check out <b>Protean</b> you\u2019ll get a wholly new system.<br/>Yet, the \u201enone core book\u201c-projects are fun as well. Like the <b>Element Class Cruisers</b> box set for Traveller or the <b>Stormlands</b> region description for Trudvang. A projects I find, quite out of the ordinary is <b>The Pallid Mask</b>. Not exactly because it\u2019s a Cthulhu Adventure, but because it offeres \u201eKing in Yellow\u201c-themed Tiki mugs. (Which I imagine to be a bit like polynesian beer steins).<br/>Among the valentines season befitting, foreign language projects you\u2019ll find <b>Wege der Vereinigungen</b>, the most recent project by Ulisses Spiele. Enriching the setting of The Dark Eye with a supplement all about (the positive) aspects of love. The book is designed with positivity as well as inclusivity in mind, well research and lavishly presented with quite some cool features like an audio-companion. I am intruiged by it, will backing and find it quite fascinating. <b>La Trilogie de la Crasse</b> (Triology of the Filth) caught my eye among the French projects. Basically because of the NC-17 sticker, yet at closer inspection it appears to offer a quite fascnating horror setting.<br/>Next to those projects you\u2019ll find (more English projects like) exciting adventures, beautiful dice, quite a lot of novels and comics based on tabletop rpgs, cool looking map projects and many more.

The book will enrich the heartwarming role-playing guy by introducing Mononoke like frog-ghosts (Kappa), Michinoke, ghosts, demons (Oni), visitors (Aliens) and others. To be taken on journeys and adventures. I do like the heartwarming approach of GSS, the style in which those new types are introduced and the game in general. Thus I backed this supplement and do recommend it.<br/>Next to the supplement you\u2019ll find two more projects for core books.<br/>At the one hand <b>Devil\u2019s Run</b>, which will come with rules for Modiphius 2d20 (Coriolis, Mutant Year Zero etc) and Savage World. The setting is based on the miniature board game Miles Massacre and offers a post-apocalyptic US. In which various tribes \u2013 who to me look akin to Fallouts Raiders \u2013 battle for their life. The tabletop rpg version will be playable without miniatures and am tempted to back it.<br/>At the other hand there\u2019s <b>Era: The Empowered</b>. Which you might remember because they did some campaigns for novels and comics based in the science fiction setting. The Era system is well proven and sports several games in various genre and I enjoyed backing their Era: Hitman projects. I do recommend taking a look at it.<br/>Next to those projects you\u2019ll find other cool ones. Like the <b>Bronze Dice</b>, a map of <b>Sommerlund</b>, story cards and more.

Which didn't made it into this list, as it was started about 2 minutes after I finished the post.<br/> <br/>It is a story-game which already exists in Finland (Tsernobyl, rakastettuni) und will be translated. I know Juhana mostly as he does create Nordic larps with Participation Design Agency - some of his latest projects he, took part in designing, were Parliament of Shadows, Enlightenment in Blood and End of the Line - well and as he's announced to be the lead writer for the Anarch book of the upcoming 5th edition of Vampire.<br/> <br/>The game itself had a quite intriguing setting. One assumes the role of criminals who fled towards Chernobyl to escape the law and can't return. Well and an even more interesting design approach, as it is designed with a Nordic larp mindest.<br/>Am really curious about it <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
