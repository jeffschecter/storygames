The CD's title is "The Decimation of Small Things".<br/>Mostly so far it's folksy indie rock and folk-punk.<br/>Bands already signed onto the project: The Darkest of the Hillside Thickets, xox, Tuck, Ghost Mice, Chris Clavin, Maria in the Shower, Hard Feelings and June Madrona.<br/><br/>More info about the game is <a href="http://buriedwithoutceremony.wordpress.com/ribbon-drive/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. If you are a musician and want to be represented on this CD, contact me!<br/><br/>If you aren't a musician, then maybe you're eagerly awaiting the release of Ribbon Drive?<br/>If so, you should just spam this thread with your enthusiasm, and I'll promptly get excited abuot the fact that pre-orders will be up soon.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212336/#Comment_212336" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-15T09:54:00+00:00" title="June 15, 2009  9:54AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>If you aren't a musician, then maybe you're eagerly awaiting the release of Ribbon Drive?<br/>If so, you should just spam this thread with your enthusiasm,</blockquote>\nSounds cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212337/#Comment_212337" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-15T10:09:58+00:00" title="June 15, 2009 10:09AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am deeply excited about this game.

At the start of play, you shuffle the mix CDs and draw one at random. That mix goes on first...<br/><br/>So, while you might make up an awesome country mix (awesome + country = I am confused by my own sentence), we might draw Rafu's norwegian death metal mix titled "Apocalypse: Sweden", and have the game start in a very different tone and locale than you were expecting. The interplay between these two CDs, as the game progresses and we switch mixes, is one of the most interesting (and sometimes creatively challenging!) parts of the game.\n<blockquote>I am deeply excited about this game. Joe, I think you said it was...I can't remember...very positive...or non-conflicty...or something....anyway, it sounds good.</blockquote>\nYeah.<br/>The game design goal I originally had was to design a game free of conflict.<br/>It was partially in response to all these conflict-focused, throw-down-in-every-scene games that were bubbling up around 06/07/08.<br/>I wanted something that was about exploration, and being human, and rethinking your stakes.<br/><br/>Some cool games came up with this idea of "giving". The Shadow of Yesterday and Dogs in the Vineyard both give you a mechanically and fictionally interesting option to back out of any given conflict.<br/><br/>And I wondered... what if there was no conflict. What if there was <i>just </i>giving? That's the birthplace of Ribbon Drive. That, and watching Wristcutters.<br/><br/>It's not entirely sans conflict in its final state. But it is completely possible to play a game of Ribbon Drive in which no obstacles are ever overcome, and no goals are ever achieved, and have it be a powerful session. So, yeah.<br/><br/>It's often positive. Sometimes in a bittersweet, nostalgic, semi-tragic way. Sometimes in a beautiful, life-affirming way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212357/#Comment_212357" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-15T11:02:28+00:00" title="June 15, 2009 11:02AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can definitely point you towards awesome country music.
