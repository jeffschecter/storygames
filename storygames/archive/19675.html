I\u2019ve done that.<br/><br/>The situation was that I was improvising (except that I had one line that I wanted to get in \u2014 \u201cIt looks like <em>you\u2019re</em> the reaper, Jones\u201d).<br/><br/>My self-developed playstyle back then had some similarities to PtbA but also lacking some of the important things that make PtbA work. For example, I was doing something in line with AWs \u201cBarf forth apolyptica\u201d by improvising features of the kingdom of the Dead.<br/>The setup was that this PC, Jones was journeying to the kingdom of the Dead to save his pal, another PC named Sarah, because she died in like a car accident or something.<br/><br/><br/>Actually, this is how weird my playstyle was then: This was in a campaign. The players were working as investigators. After a session in which Sarah didn\u2019t appear, we were playing the denuement and the attendant PCs were at their office and there Jones recieved a parcel. He unwrapped it, it contained a wooden box with hinged lids filled with earth and he realized that Sarah was dead. I had intended the box to mean that, I know that, but I don\u2019t remember if the player understood it or if I told the player \u2014 I do remember that we did play out the PCs understanding of it. So her death was wholly offscreen and as far as I remember it, this event and the box and her death was very much a whim.<br/>I knew it was there to throw a wrench in my own gears, that she would be brought back and that she wasn\u2019t out of the campaign. The game was already jumping all over the time line (e.g. one session would take place in 2005 and the next in 1993) and we could, if nothing else, play before she died.<br/><br/>As it turned out, the next session opportunity we had was them two and me, up in their bed with candlelight and black sky outside. I had the name of the session \u201cDon\u2019t look back\u201d (obvious Orpheus reference), which I gave them, and the line \u201cLooks like <em>you\u2019re</em> the reaper, Jones\u201d in my mind but zero prep. That was my style back then, never ever prepping.<br/><br/>Jones would journey to the kingdom of the Dead to rescue her. But the twist I came up with \u2014 I didn\u2019t say this explicitly, instead I tried to convey it subtly and consistently, was that the journey there was a trip through time, sort of.<br/>The party was split but I alternated rapidly between the two.<br/>From Jones\u2019 perspective, I was improvising as he was visiting a magician, coming up with the rites and how it felt on the fly, and then as he went back in time everything he saw was super gothy and spooky. Like cars were dirges pulled by skeletal horses etc etc.<br/><br/>Whereas from Sarah\u2019s perspective, I was improvising the day of her death, the city looked normal (because she was in her \u201cpresent\u201d) but the day was full of omens \u2014 huge flocks of black birds forming letters in the sky, chimes of doomful clocks, thinks like that. However, while her city looked normal, whenever she saw Jones, he looked like a skeletal apparition. The take was that seeing things from the other timeline \u2014 in both directions \u2014 made them look halloweeny and morbid.<br/>All of this was improvised and, I realize as I\u2019m typing this, kind of silly and teenage gothy, but we played it totally straight and moody in the candlelight, which was awesome and those two players were a match made in heaven for the style I had at the time, I was very satisfied with them.<br/>What ended up happening was that she was spooked by this apparition (Jones), turned her head to look at him in fear, and got killed in a car accident.<br/><br/>We had plenty of playtime left, I had recently rewatched Groundhog Day, so I gave Jones chance after chance to go back there, every time doing something subtly different, until she survived.<br/><br/>So yeah, that\u2019s rewind &amp; redo the way I did it back then.<br/>The session was moody and I was happy with it, but at the same time it felt bad that I had rewound it so many times.<br/>Looking back at my playstyle more generally back then, I was proud that I wasn\u2019t a \u201crailroading GM\u201d because I never prepped, or only prepped like one sentence like thinking \u201cOK, the next session the city will be drowned in a deluge\u201d and things like that. One thing that the session would \u201cbe about\u201d and then running the rest at the table \u2014 so since I was improvising so much, then of course I couldn\u2019t be railroading, I told myself. If the players really want to go somewhere and do something, I\u2019ll let them.<br/><br/>But honestly speaking the player agency was, in some ways, very low. They were \u201ctrapped in my telling\u201d.<br/>And it was hard to bring them back for sessions. They said they liked it, but... I can tell in retrospect, there were never any \u201cOH, when\u2019s the next session, I can\u2019t wait!\u201d moments.<br/>The characters were pregens, too: just a few sentences each, which they fleshed out through play.<br/><br/>In some ways we were reinventing some narrativist techniques (which I wasn\u2019t aware of at the time) like author stance, I\u2019d give the players some things here and there to describe.<br/>My proudest moments from this era are about another player: I\u2019d give him things like when his character was through hallucinations (this was in a session inspired by GURPS CthulhuPunk, but not using GURPS, just using \u201cfreeform\u201d) where seing true visions of the Lovecraftian reality, and I had him narrate this and invent it himself, telling the other players what he saw.<br/>The best moment was in a superhero game where his character swapped minds with the BBEG and I had him narrate the BBEG\u2019s plans and emotions \u2014 having whatever he came up with become true.<br/><br/>Oh, well \u2014 these sessions were satisfying for him and me but not the other players. They quickly dropped out.<br/>In retrospect, I obviously should\u2019ve given them more of the same.<br/>But it wasn\u2019t that I thought of the idea to give people author power willy nilly (because I didn\u2019t know of the strides that where happening over at the Forge). I did it when there where diegetic reasons to do so, like mind swaps and hallucinations, and I deliberately inserted such situations to benefit this one player because I viewed him as such a trustworthy \u201crock\u201d when it came to this type of play.<br/><br/>This was in the 2000 to 2008 era but I wasn\u2019t clued in, I had mostly developed this from failing with BRP and GURPS and then reading Everway, SLUG and Fudge.<br/>But we didn\u2019t use rules or dice. I, the DM, decided everything.<br/><br/>So that\u2019s why I don\u2019t understand some of the advice in, say, DoD 91 and many other Swedish games (even still). If the CA is \u201cCome, immerse yourself and the DM will do her best to give you a satisfying story\u201d, then those rules were making that harder, not easier.<br/>If the CA is \u201cCome, let\u2019s create a story together\u201d, then rules or structure for creating a story together (such as Fiasco or Pantheon) are helpful (but I believe it\u2019s possible to go without).<br/>The CA I\u2019m experimenting with now is \u201cCome, let\u2019s enter this interesting world, without going for immersion or story\u201d. A mix of Right to Dream and Step On Up, sort of \u2014 not going for realism, either, but exploring a world and the rules that make up the world. I loved the turn structures in older D&amp;D. When I was a player in Barrowmaze, we totally engaged with the dungeon like that: not in real time, but like \u201cOK, we want to go here and here. We are walking in this manner, in this marching order, and with these look-out and trapfinding procedures. Is that OK?\u201d. The DM would calculate how long it would take to do that and rolled for encounters, and say \u201cOK, you only get this far, because you see zombies\u201d or \u201cOK, you\u2019re there\u201d. And we\u2019d go \u201cOK, hench A is tearing down this wall here, while we are standing lookout here and here\u201d.<br/>That\u2019s a pretty messed up CA, almost a 180 from my previous style, but I think I need that right now.<br/>It is very satisfying to interact in the spot where system meets fiction.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436980/#Comment_436980" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T03:52:10+00:00" title="August 12, 2014  3:52AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whereas I understand that this thread is more negative, but aimed myself and caused by a drive to document.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437324/#Comment_437324" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-14T23:26:44+00:00" title="August 14, 2014 11:26PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure if you want any kind of response or input, but I enjoyed reading this.
