So much nifty and no time and no group to play with!<br/>Going over a recent try at FATE, I found I did not like it at all.  The aspects, a part I thought I would love, turned out to be out of my league.  I don't think that one is for me.<br/><br/>So I'm looking at one of the inspirations for FATE, the game system Fudge.  Looks cool, uses the same dice I bought 20 of and has a lot of flexibility.  As written it has some cool points to it, but I think I like the other dice systems better.  what is essentially 4d3, so a high bell curve with a nine point spread from -4 to +4 compared to 2d10 or even d20.  I do like the flatter curve better, I must say.  Critical hits are nifty, and you can have more with a flat single die roll.  I'm thinking of going with a d12, just because dodecahedrons are nice.  I also like the idea of tokens to buy your way out of bad rolls when you have to.  I got hooked on those with savage worlds, and now I can hardly play without them.  So I'll have to write those into my game.  I think I like best how it works for Red Box Hack, where each one is worth either a +2 to hit or a +1 to damage, and you can use as many as you have, and you have special moves to gain them (showing off) or get them for your friends (lend a hand).  You have your whole bard thing right there!  Gives the cheerleader character something to really effect the fight, see!<br/><br/>So I [i]could[/i] go play something, or I can write something my self.<br/><br/>And here is the other thing.  I'm a fan.  I am a wooly lamb that follows the flock!  I like the idea of a completely original setting and so forth, but what I actually like is to have my game be in a setting I recognize and already know something of.  I'm just starting to get out of this, but I mean for years I blew off Farscape because it was different from Star Trek!  How silly, right!  Strangely enough I had no problem with Babylon 5, but that is another story.<br/><br/>The go to setting for me would seem to be the pseudomedieval fantasy land, even though I've had a lot of fun with many other settings.  In fact, if you take standard fantasy, plop it down in a busy near future city and add heavy full automatic weapons, you get that much more fun, so long as you can wink an eye at the misery of the general public.  Then again, I suppose dragon gnawed peasants really don't have it any better, but they have no TV, so....<br/><br/>That leads me to write a word or two about Hulks and Horrors, a d20 treatment of sci fi that boils down to, in essence, D&amp;D in Space!  Really cool game, mighty cheap on the pdf game store, and when I ran it I had a great time.  That is a game i could play for a while, even if it doesn't have bennies, awesome points, Karma or whatnot.  Of course if it is my game, I could bolt them on, I reckon.<br/><br/>That will do for now.  Had to say something.  Unemployable. Injured back. Gonna retrain but a little stir crazy for now.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410639/#Comment_410639" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-27T18:53:30+00:00" title="March 27, 2013  6:53PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Check out Tenra Bansho Zero!
