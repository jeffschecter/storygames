I've commonly seen GMs (and I do it as well) re-describe what happened in a round so everyone is on the same page before continuing. <br/><br/>What I'm saying is the players don't describe what's happening, even their own success or failure. They only describe the initiation of an action, "I swing my sword", never the results. <br/><br/>I've played with groups where this is standard but I was still surprised (it may have just been something I haven't experienced in a while). And I know people who really enjoy this style. They said they play to socialize and experience the GM's story. They enjoy seeing if their actions succeed or fail but describing them isn't important. One person described playing as rolling dice to activate the GM. It's almost like pointing to the GM and saying... "go GM, go!" <br/><br/>In these games, some people like it so it's great but others didn't. And even though different people wanted different things, and it would be trivial (I think, maybe I'm selling what's involved short) to give everyone what they wanted (GM describes Bob's success but Sarah describes her own), in these groups there was no flexibility. I talked to everyone about it. GMs just said this was their style. And the players who didn't like it said they like enough of the rest of the game that they just deal with it. Some players who also GM say they deal with it because they will get to describe what happens when it is their time to GM. <br/><br/>For me the issue wasn't that I couldn't describe the results of my actions. I play plenty of games where there is no description. But in those games you have plenty of other things to do. In these games, I felt like I spent 90% of the time passively listening. Even in games where there is a railroaded plot, I felt like I was doing something. Maybe that's the key, in those games I felt like I was doing something. But in the games I recently played, there was no illusion. In fact, it was very honest about what the game was and wasn't. And a lot of people loved it. The other thing that struck me was the games had 7-10+ players. Maybe there just isn't time for the players to describe anything with that many people! <br/><br/>Have you experienced games where players never describe the results of their rolls? How common is it? <br/><br/>Best,<br/>John                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299728/#Comment_299728" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T07:36:42+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  7:36AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 8, 2010 7:45AM by Ry.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Super common among traditional GMs. <br/><br/>I GMed like this for the first 5 years of gaming (the high school years).  In Vincent's terms when a PC attacked a monster, the players were in charge of describing Intention, Initiation, then we'd roll dice, and I described Execution Effect (in gory detail).  Reverse, though, when monsters attacked PCs - I'd describe Intention and Initiation, roll dice, and they would describe Execution and Effect (but in this case, downplayed).<br/><br/>It's also called the <a href="http://kuoi.com/~kamikaze/SixWordRPG/mainrules.php" rel="nofollow">Six-Word RPG</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299729/#Comment_299729" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T07:38:43+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  7:38AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This was so common with my game group (before I started bringing in narrativist elements within the last year or so), that it was practically THE rule. It was unheard of to have the players describe how they succeed or fail, because that might clash with what other players or the GM would want (typically the GM, tho). While this would work sometimes, and the GM would provide ample description for us, the players, to get some insight in what we could do later to rectify that situation, it was not always the case.<br/>For instance, shortly before I had to take my recent gaming hiatus, we were starting to play GURPS Black Ops again (I should say "continuing," but I was jumping in fresh to that game). Our agents, from the get-go, were given little info about what the results of our success or failures were...hell, we were given little information about what we were allowed to aquisition, for that matter. Being dropped at a creature-infested reserach facility on a remote island, our failures were met with "nothing happens," or "that doesn't work," and our successes with "you hit it," or "it opens." Particularly when we found ourselves trapped by an insane supercomputer that was trying to convert us to some bizarre spider-cyborgs, all we knew when rolling was that we succeeded or failed...but how that affected the game we could hardly tell. Quite frustrating. But then, this should be considered a fairly extreme example.<br/>Still, at least with the people I've played with over the years, it seems the tradition has been "Player describes what they want to do and roll, while the GM takes that roll result and fills in the blanks based on success or failure."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grymbok" title="Grymbok"><img alt="Grymbok" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grymbok">Grymbok</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299730/#Comment_299730" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T07:38:52+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  7:38AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh.

When 3-4 of us play, it's not too hard to deal with. Actually, I may be wrong here. I think it's not that it is easier to deal with conflicts, but conflicts are less likely to happen as we can stop what causes them before they get too far.

Some of my friends who play Pathfinder considered one of their friends who started a D&amp;D 4E game to be a traitor. There are all these hard lines drawn separating groups form each other. Two groups were arguing about action points. One group felt that if a game allowed you to spend action points after a roll (like Fate Points in Dresden Files) then they would either refuse to play or hack it out of the game. Where the other group liked that feature. Either way, it's a minimal detail but everyone felt so passionate about it that they would refuse to play with their friends unless all their demands were met.<br/><br/>I've been asking the groups if they go to or rent movies together. Commonly most people used to but don't anymore because it is rare they can agree on a movie. But they miss getting together so instead of trying to choose a movie they like, they have bad movie nights as it is easier to agree which movies are absolutely terrible and watch them together. <br/><br/>Gaming was always something we agreed to compromise on, so we could get a group of people together. I would be willing to accept a few things I didn't like in exchange for a few things others wouldn't normally enjoy. It took effort but it worked. Maybe it's as simple as... with less time and more choice, people fracture. <br/><br/>I guess the most bizarre thing for me was the lack of compromise. It's weird to me when people won't make exceptions. But this may also come down to the group size issue and the basics of supply and demand. If your group has 8 players, you don't need to compromise to accommodate a 9th person!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299752/#Comment_299752" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T09:29:17+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  9:29AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a recent 0e experience at my regular Thursday night group, wherein four out of five players were totally down for house-ruling, for "rulilngs, not rules", the whole OSR package.<br/>One player was emphatically not, reminiscent of this description here: <blockquote>One group felt that if a game allowed you to spend action points after a roll (like Fate Points in Dresden Files) then they would either refuse to play or hack it out of the game. </blockquote> This, imo, comes from an overattachment to a particular game system, wholeheartedly taking on ALL of its properties as THE way to game. The player in question was fixated (if I may be judgy for a moment) on D&amp;D 3.5 - not only did he frequently compare the mechanics of the two games (our 0e game at hand, and 3.5), but when he encountered unfamiliar play procedures, he basically freaked out - getting visibly upset that we would play in such a fashion as on-the-spot rulings and tweaks, scoffing with "So now you're just changing the mechanics?"<br/><br/>The fact that we arrived at this conclusion by explicit consensus-building did not calm him in the slightest. Peculiar, then - rather than the stakes being "Now the GM can change our characters at will!", I think, since the whole group was in on it, the stakes might've had more to do with capturing a "correct" method of play. But I might be wrong - towards the end of the adventure, I think I told him he should narrate the effect of some action he'd taken, and his face lit up with conflicting, but overall positive, emotion: "I've never had a GM let me do that before!" came his reply. <br/><br/>The consensus in the rest of the group, who had all gamed with him before, was that this player was disruptively attached to his particular mode of play, and I don't think I'll bother extending a hand next time. If this had been the first time he'd disrupted Thursday night play (on this occasion, he went out for Chinese food, mid-play, to signal his frustration), I would have a lot more desire to try sharing this new play style with him. Certainly, I've gotten people interested in 0e style and player-agency style before; and there is a certain amount of explaining and patience that can be required to get the new ideas across effectively. Sadly, in this case I might just have to set some boundaries <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/><br/><br/>Also: I've totally been in a group where we have far too many players, divergent pc goals, and downtime activities up to and including DDR, sketchbooking, and reading comics (that last one was me...).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299754/#Comment_299754" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T09:38:12+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  9:38AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 8, 2010 9:45AM by Teataine.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Crossposted with Zac, the below was for John. <br/><br/>Chray-zeee. Parallel story:<br/><br/>This other day I went into my FLGS (the only one in the whole country, maybe one of two, as far as I know), and I saw some of the new Red Boxes on the shelves. So...<br/>Me: "Oh, you've got the new red box."<br/>Store Owner: "The what?" <br/>Me: "Red Box. That thing."<br/>Store Owner: "Oh, yeah."<br/>Me: "Selling any?"<br/>Store Owner: "Naaah, it's like, with 4E...it's like a boardgame, so everyone has gone over to play other stuff, like Pathfinder."<br/>Me: ...<br/><br/>So here you have a guy that lives on selling games to other people, who has a product that's great for introducing people into the hobby, and he isn't selling it or motivated to sell it, because "it's not a real rpg".<br/><br/>It seems like a common assumption that the only people who will buy a rpg are rpg-ers, and hence, a rpg "not being a real rpg", won't sell at all. So instead of pushing the product up front, with the big beautiful package and art, to appeal to newcomers and kids who buy Yu-Gi-Oh there, he just puts it on the back shelf to collect dust.<br/><br/>I think, somehow, all these people should be told that "roleplaying" is not one thing and "playing a rpg" doesn't mean the same to everyone. That it's like cards: you can play bridge, poker, hearts, old maid or pokemon. Play a little of each, take turns, challenge your expectations a bit. It's not that hard? If you just can't agree on anything, not even a movie, well, I dunno, that's probably a different problem entirely.<br/><br/><br/>This is after Zac posted:<br/>I'm speculating that a lot of this rigid, almost panicky attachment to a certain ruleset, a certain mode of play comes from having a history of bad play. The player relies on rules, or rather a specific set of rules, as a safety zone. "I know this works.", because it's his last bastion of defense against an abusive, tyrannical GM. I would suggest giving the dude another chance, ease him into it. Show him that you're not "out to get him", but rather that you're all there to groove. Maybe he'll get it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Parke" title="Parke"><img alt="Parke" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v97/mikker/Zoosmell.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Parke">Parke</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299756/#Comment_299756" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T09:49:38+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  9:49AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 8, 2010 10:01AM by Parke.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>How common is this?<br/><br/>In these unrelated groups, the following was common:<br/><br/>- player states action (I try to disarm)<br/>- player rolls<br/>- GM determines success or failure<br/>- GM describes what happens in the fiction, even the PC's actions<br/></blockquote>\nYou know how everyone here has a different definition of "indie" vs "traditional"?

I've been to 2 game stores where the people working there tried to talk us out of buying 4E material they were selling! I don't understand it. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Parke</cite>There exist people who subconsciously consider the game they play to be a part of their identity, so criticisms of the game are taken very personally.</blockquote>\nTrue. I think this also applies to more than gaming. I've seen this with TV shows, foods, neighborhoods, deodorant! People tend to like something for emotional reasons and then rationalize their like after the fact. And a lot of those emotional reasons are tied up in self worth. So you might be arguing the merits of a game and the person reacts as if you are personally attacking them. It's a sticky issue! <br/><br/>I think Wizards made the mistake of saying aspects of 3E were bad, which is why 4E is good. That's only going to piss people off. Show me the merits of something with concrete examples and present it as a choice. Because so much of this is emotional, not rational, I think it's important to be sensitive. And it's a really bad idea to try to convince someone they have a problem they don't think they have so you can sell them a solution. <br/><br/>Although the problem with breaking down into sides (vs being ok and accommodating of different preferences) is that the other side may consider you a threat for just being different. Even if I don't try to change someone, me just being me is a problem because it's taken as commentary on someone else's choices. It's just like when someone says they are Vegan or don't drink. So many people become immediately uncomfortable and start questioning why they are Vegan. Well, would you eat meat if this happened? Or this? Or that? It's ok if you're not Vegan!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299773/#Comment_299773" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T10:47:09+00:00" title="November  8, 2010 10:47AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 8, 2010 11:14AM by jenskot.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Before playing with these groups, my Pathfinder friends asked me what I want from an RPG. <br/><br/>I said probably the bare minimum...<br/><br/>- I don't want to be bored<br/>- I want my character to be important to the game<br/>- I want to make choices and describe what my character does<br/>- I want what I choose and what I describe to matter<br/>- I want to socialize with people<br/><br/>I could be way more specific and add a lot more to that list but that's the minimum. <br/><br/>I thought I was being ridiculously conservative. It's not like I'm saying I want to play a game where there is a tiny skill list, free form traits, as much non-combat as combat, skills progress as you use them, no classes, dice pools, action points, aspects, in a hard scifi setting and so on. <br/><br/>But my friends told me I wouldn't enjoy playing in their groups. The only minimum requirement I could count on is the last one, socializing with people. I didn't believe them (I though they were selling themselves short) so they invited me to come play. After playing, I joined up with a few other groups to see how they were similar or different. And then I started this thread! <br/><br/>I should also point out, that many of these games were fun in other ways. I thought some of the stories were comparable to modern fiction or what you would watch on TV. Lots of GMs get flack for being frustrated authors. But most of these people were actually authors (or could be).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299781/#Comment_299781" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T11:19:07+00:00" title="November  8, 2010 11:19AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the group I play this is the norm.<br/>\n<br/>\n- player states action (I try to disarm)<br/>\n- player rolls<br/>\n- GM determines success or failure<br/>\n- GM describes what happens in the fiction, even the PC's actions<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the routine when dice are involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we have large times of in character conversations it seems the correct thing to do and reduces the use of dice.<br/>\nAlso we have times of third person narration.This generally explains the characters perception of what the Dm describes.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I have always thought the modes of interacting conflict.

Does that describe what you experienced (when it didn't suck)?<br><br>As to your original question:<br>When I played Pathfinder, Vampire, and M&amp;M-style games, character sovereignty was the one inviolable player right that kept people empowered enough to play.  GMs <i>had</i> to describe outcomes in terms of "this happens <i>to</i> you" -- "you <i>do</i> this" was an absolute deal-breaker.<br><br>These players were sometimes content to be uninvolved for stretches of time; it wasn't a need to contribute <i>more</i>, it was just a need to have some reliable control when they did contribute.  Of course there was <i>much more</i> tuning out when someone felt unable to contribute how they liked.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299787/#Comment_299787" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T11:56:15+00:00" title="November  8, 2010 11:56AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It certainly does sound like one of those games where the GM is really playing by himself and the players are just lending him their characters as extras in his personal movie.

The games feel like a party! Even in the way that not everyone has to pay attention at every moment. <br><br>My guess is that the primary motivation is social. No one wants to turn anyone away so everyone is invited (hence the large groups). <br/><br/>I'd say half the players are really excited about the various GMs' stories. Some of the players are writers and film makers and take notes during games. I know a few of them are working on publishing material inspired by the games. And the material is pretty good. <br/><br/>Other people love the pre-play aspect of RPGs. They love reading RPGs, making characters, choosing gear, feats, or other fiddly bits. <br/><br/>And for some of the players, just being able to choose their character's actions and then have the GM narrate is enough to feel immersed in their characters. Some of them described the lack of control making the game feel more emotionally real. <br/><br/>The people who don't seem happy are people who don't have a high level of patience since the games are slow, people who love rules (since it isn't clear what rules are being used and anything can be changed on the fly), and people who want to tell their own stories (usually who also GM).                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299797/#Comment_299797" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T12:35:22+00:00" title="November  8, 2010 12:35PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I should also note that when I describe these games, many people don't believe me when I say people are enjoying themselves.

For me, not being able to describe how my character succeeds feels limiting. But for many involved, the ability to create your character (although in some games all characters were pre-gens), choose your actions, and free form roleplay felt like an incredible amount of influence over the story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299803/#Comment_299803" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T12:44:26+00:00" title="November  8, 2010 12:44PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That makes sense!

If you have a halfway accommodating DM and the group wants to go fight Giants in the jungle, he can whip up that adventure for you, and then you can bring your dude there and run the level. But you also don't have to know all the rules, just those that your PC needs, and if you're not inclined to do much more than come up with some basic background and then enjoy the tactical part of the game, you're set. <br/><br/>I suspect that you'll find that most of the people who play this way will swear they a having piles of fun. They want just enough interactivity out of their entertainment to feel some agency without the pressure of having to perform all the time. As someone with a theater background, it's very natural and doesn't feel like WORK for me to come up with all that description and narration; I choose to be extremely flattered that a group of smart, fun people find it compelling enough that they ask me to keep doing it, rather than getting upset they don't want the same things out of gaming I do. When I want an open world with full agency, I go hang with the JiffyCon crowd, and have a great time both places. And frankly, sometimes I just want to chill out, have a beer, and play a fancy complicated board game where someone else handles most of the math and the rules, but I get to spend 5 minutes coming up with a background, and that's totally cool and I am still GAMING and anyone who says otherwise can go Burn a Wheel.<br/><br/>If you can get the right group, then having a narrativist story game nerd run for a bunch of more casual gamer interested in the kind of play you're talking about is actually the best compromise there is.<br/><br/>-Jim C.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20L" title="Dave L"><img alt="Dave L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20L">Dave L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299811/#Comment_299811" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T13:06:23+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  1:06PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In D&amp;D; (for example), saying "I try to disarm him" is a big choice.  So is "I move behind the orc and backstab him" or "I cast Obscuring Mist".  It's possible that the players are happy with that level of choice and they don't really care exactly how the disarm succeeds or fails, if you backstab the orc in the kidneys or cut his femoral artery, or how eerie purple mists pour out of your ears.  If the DM wants to pretty it up, that's cool, but it's not why they are playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be interesting to see if these same groups played Mutants and Masterminds in the same way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299812/#Comment_299812" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T13:09:09+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  1:09PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I should also note, that even though I was trying my best to be empathic to everyone's preferences whenever anyone asked me to express my own interests, some people looked at me like I was insane. Which was a bit disheartening. But the idea that I wanted to describe how my character succeeds seemed like... I don't know how to describe it... it was more than not normal, it was like I was violating something. <br><br>It reminded me of when I played Rifts. I've never played Rifts but was intimidated by some of the rules I read and the complexity of the 4 page character sheet I was handed. But the players were excited so I jumped in. <br/><br/>We started playing and no matter what I tried I kept failing. I asked for help but the advice I was given of which weapons or attacks to use didn't pan out. Then I noticed my space marine mutant cyborg crazy character had an Axe skill of 120%! I thought to myself, "why do I bother with the giant laser cannon gun that may do crazy damage but can never hit when I can use my Axe with my incredible skill." So I said, "I want to hit the cross dimensional alien with my Axe". GM nods, I roll, and of course I hit! I'm not sure how I could fail with a 120% chance out of 100% (maybe modifiers). But I couldn't find on my character sheet where my Axe damage was listed...<br/><br/>...turns out I didn't have an Axe even though I was a walking armory with laser swords and more. The GM was annoyed I didn't check to see if I had an Axe first. I thought, no problem. Can we say I had an Axe since I seem to be the best person in the universe with an Axe or is there maybe an Axe or an Axe-like weapon laying around in this war zone I could use? The GM was not happy! I crossed some line that I didn't know existed.<br/><br/>The GM berated me about being an indy game player and how we expect things too easily. He listed as an example that I would probably expect my character to have a car if I am the best driver in the world. And I replied, not trying to be cute, that sounds reasonable to me. He wasn't happy! Now, I suspect he was pissed for reasons other than my Axe mistake. And the indy games comments probably was indication of some past gripe he had that was making its way into the game. It was starting to transform from a creative issue into a social one. Ultimately it resolved but I was caught by surprise how big of a deal it turned into. <br/><br/>Now I think my story above is an extreme example. But people looking at me like I was insane for saying I like to describe how my character succeeds reminded me of this. I didn't realize how hard the lines were drawn. I view myself as a fairly moderate person which is partly why I'm often so surprised by these situations.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299813/#Comment_299813" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T13:14:53+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  1:14PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jim Crocker and Dave L,<br/><br/>Great points!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299814/#Comment_299814" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T13:15:25+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  1:15PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave-<br/><br/>You've definitely IDed the general vibe of the D&amp;D games I run. There's also the fact that the regular leveling up provides resource management and customization that I know so e SG folks might not call real agency, but it's also a form of autonomy that certainly engages everyone in the game pretty thoroughly.<br/><br/>One other thing that may not be apparent at the table is the amount of agency any particular DM/GM confers on players by encouraging between game content creation with writing, taking world building ideas, etc. I know that the couple of writers. In my game are at least as deeply engaged by the between game writing they do as they are by the game day activities.

Although much like LARPs I've seen, often there is a debriefing session at the end where everyone finds out what they missed which gets them excited to play again in the future.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299818/#Comment_299818" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T13:24:16+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  1:24PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2011 11:17PM by Jim_Crocker.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>How common is this?<br/><br/>I've been playing 1 shots with different groups (mostly strangers) of Pathfinder, Vampire, and Mutants &amp; Masterminds as part of a project I'm working on.<br/><br/>In these unrelated groups, the following was common:<br/><br/>- player states action (I try to disarm)<br/>- player rolls<br/>- GM determines success or failure<br/>- GM describes what happens in the fiction, even the PC's actions<br/></blockquote>\nI would quibble and say that it's the game rules that determine success or failure. I think its one reason the players are willing to accept the DMs interpretation, because everyone agrees it's just a narration of events that the dice and rules point to. And the players realize the ways in which the DMs ability to thwart whatever story goals they have is constrained by those rules as well. (If they're a good, fair DM, anyway...)<br/><br/>But the general principle stands. Yes, I think the vast majority of leisure, as opposed to 'lifestyle' gamers play this way because it's a level of involvement and interaction they're familiar and comfortable with, especially from PC and console gaming.<br/><br/>-JC                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299821/#Comment_299821" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T13:40:52+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  1:40PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jim, <br/><br/>In terms of the rules determining success or failure, that didn't seem to be the case in these games. At least not exactly. <br/><br/>One of the other reasons I played in these games is that I plan on entering the Iron GM tournament whenever it comes to the North East (US). The tournament uses D&amp;D 3.5 / Pathfinder so I wanted to play with GMs who are known to kick major ass with those (or similar) systems. <br/><br/>I spoke with the GMs after the games, to find out what makes them successful and how they handle the different parts of the game that I think may be challenging. Encounter balance and tracking all the different conditions, effects, and spells that last rounds, minutes, or hours seemed difficult to me. Each GM admitted they fake everything. They don't really track anything and they change all the numbers on the fly. Monsters don't really have stats and when they do they adjust them up and down, round by round, based on what is happening in the game. And success or failure is often determined by what would be most appropriate for the story at hand, not what the rules dictate. <br/><br/>I asked if there was a way to balance it all, make sure everyone has fun, and keep it all manageable without hacking everything moment to moment and not one person said yes. <br/><br/>Based on the above, is why I phrased step 3 as "GM determines success or failure". Although the rules do have an impact so it's not 100% true but seemed close. <br/><br/>Does that make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299838/#Comment_299838" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T14:35:40+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  2:35PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow...given that level of rules ignoring, winging it, and concession that its impossible to actually balance everything R.A.W...why are the fans so adamantly in love with 3.5/pathfinder?<br/><br/>I struggle to understand the logic of loving a game that you ignore 80% in order to make it work...but then that's kind of been a Forge Rant point since day one, nothing new there.

Many of the players never read the DMG and aren't interested in the GM side of things. From their perspective, the game is functioning amazingly well. <br/><br/>I've spoken to Pathfinder GMs who have said they wished they could GM something else but it feels easier to hack everything. A few of them LOVED Dogs in the Vineyard's Town and NPC creation. They were like... that's it? That's so simple I can do everything I want and not change anything. But the players who liked Pathfinder didn't like playing Dogs beyond playing 1-3 games (although they loved gaining Traits from fallout and constantly evolving their characters through conflicts). <br/><br/>Character creation in games like Pathfinder do an amazing job of simulating this heroic fictional character players imagine and fantasize about playing. Free form traits feel wishy washy to them. But an 18 stat feels real. And the books and books of feats really hook them in. Even though in reality there are 1,000s of Feats that are just, pick 2 skills, you gain a +2 in each, give this Feat a cool name. But the color, choice, depth of customization, and thrill of hunting for the right option is exhilarating. And the fact that Leveling meant they could keep recreating their characters, it was like Character Creation never stops... they love it!<br/><br/>Many of them hate 4E but love Iron Heroes and Mike Mearls worked on both. I asked them, I thought you guys loved Iron Heroes when it came out. D&amp;D 4E uses a lot of what you loved about Iron Heroes, so why do you hate it so much? The answer was that Iron Heroes gave them more options but never told them how to play. It expanded the kinds of characters they could create. Where 4E took options away and told them how they should play the game. Where in 3E they could go wild and free. Keep in mind, I'm not saying they are correct, I'm just saying this is how they feel. And of course "they" is probably not a big enough sample size to really make generalized statements. I'm only speaking about the people I have directly interacted with.<br/><br/>But ultimately the point is a lot of the details that may be problematic are hidden from the players. And the parts that the players directly manipulate work really well. <br/><br/><b><a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> Player Networks</b><br/><br/>It's easier to get people to play what they know. And a lot of people know D&amp;D. It's easier for GMs to hack D&amp;D than to find players to play something new. The D&amp;D pool of players is huge! That's why the OGL concept was so great (maybe not financially but in terms of growing the number of players).<br/><br/>That said, GMs are willing to try more things (at least relative to players). Which is why I often see Story Game groups consist of mostly GMs of other games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299857/#Comment_299857" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T15:32:14+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  3:32PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> is obvious, should have thought of that as one of the givens.<br/><br/>But <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> is downright fascinating.

I've GMed that way as well. It works great. <br/><br/>What caught me off guard was that describing your action's result wasn't allowed in many of these games. And the mention of it seemed highly controversial. It's also so far away from any of my gaming, that I was surprised by how common it was. But it makes sense. I suspect my early experiences are the weird exception, not the other way around.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299920/#Comment_299920" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T21:10:46+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  9:10PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>So the players are essentially playing this elaborate game of loney-fun-puzzle-assembly with their characters...largely oblivious to (or at least happily complacent with) the fact that very little of the details they are lovingly collecting makes all that much of a difference mechanically (due to the GM winging large swaths of play anyway).  At the same time those details have a profound difference in their visualization of their characters and hense enjoyment of play.<br/><br/>That the elaborate exercize seems more "real" and thus a more effective aid to that visualization than "wishy washy" free form traits speaks to some fascinating psychology I'm ill equipped to tease-out.<br/><br/>Do you have a feel for how much those details affect the player's own visualization of their character vs. affecting other player's visualization of their character?  Does Jim enjoy / appreciate / pay attention to the nuances and layers of the character Steve built?  Or is only their own character that real to them, while the others are just black boxes of effectiveness played by other people?</blockquote>\nMy experience was that there wasn't much of a shared imagined space. PCs were very much black boxes of effectiveness to the other players and the GM. And often players would drop in and out of the game in a very fluid way. It wasn't uncommon to walk away from combat till it was your turn, describe a crazy action, roll a die, let the GM figure out how it all works together, and then walk away till it was your turn again.<br/><br/>In 2 of the games, every few hours the GM would recap for everyone what was going on since so many players weren't present or paying attention for various crucial moments. And players were super into these recaps. Some of what I'm describing might seem like the players only care about combat and that wasn't the case. <br/><br/>And even though on the GM side of the screen, the rules didn't matter, on the players side, the rules were really important. And even with the GM fudging numbers, there is still plenty of cool rules that work regardless of what the target numbers are. Players still get the satisfaction of seeing their Feat tree combos go wild... I trip, I get a free hit, which increased my critical to x3, which gives me a grapple, which heals me 10 hit points, which activates my free 5 foot step. And the damage players roll is independent of whatever the GM does. If I hit, no matter what the GM does behind the screen, I still roll 6d6 sneak attack damage for multiclassing 6 times into 6 different classes that each get +1d6 sneak attack damage at first level. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>I'd follow up Ralph's question by asking the same about the GM's attention.  I could see Steve being cool with being ignored by Jim, as long as the GM validates Steve's character build with stuff like, "The bad guy shits his pants when he sees your giant laser!"</blockquote>\nOften the GM didn't know Steve had a giant laser. So they didn't plan encounters around character's specialties but the GMs did do a good job of selling the player's actions in the moment. Steve pulls out a giant laser, GM is surprised this crazy thing exists in the game but sells it being awesome anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299922/#Comment_299922" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T21:34:20+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  9:34PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, that is crazy alien to me.

Although the rules do have an impact so it's not 100% true but seemed close.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?</blockquote>\nWell in that context, then yeah, it does, but I'd argue that as the PLAYERS are engaging the game, it's the rules determining the outcome, and not the DM, even though there is more than likely a tacit understanding at every table of every game that ANY game with a DM/GM/MC will see some occasional fudging if the guy (or gal!) in charge thinks that'll make it more fun. Your point's well-taken, though... I've never taken the fudging close to <i>that</i> far, but I can see why you'd have to when you take a system as baroque as D&amp;D 3.5 and THEN bolt all those lightly-playtested 3rd party bits onto it and run your game up over about 12th level where things just start to get crazy... (I was interested in Iron DM myself, they're running it at TotalCon here in MA next Feb, until I saw it was 3.5, and decided it wasn't worth the migraines of running that rules set (now 2 years gone for me) to have the story fun that could be had).<br/><br/>I've always felt that if we all agreed in advance that we were playing the way you describe in the O/P, then I had a significant obligation to actually cleave to the rules as much as possible (and also because I play in public in my shop, where the rules need to be as close to 'out of the book' as possible to accommodate in-store play). It certainly helps inspire confidence that I am giving everyone the same fair chance at everyday little victories at the table and subsequent influence of the story.<br/><br/>We've actually embraced 4e and I don't care if I never play another 3.5 game again. We found all that over-complexity got in the way of the sought-after 'console-ness' of our brand of D&amp;D; I get why the power gamers who derive pleasure from system mastery (or, more appropriately, system <i>advantage</i>) are cranky with it, but I have and will continue to argue that it reinforces the same general style of play, basically what you're talking about above, with only slightly different mechanical conventions; any arguments about how the game "forces" you to play, or how one version is 'great for RP' and the other lame are just silly, of course, you get out of them what you put in as authors at the table, they're far more alike than different!<br/><br/>-Jim C.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299949/#Comment_299949" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T01:32:06+00:00" title="November  9, 2010  1:32AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, this stuff is invaluable.

The game is Feats and multi-classing.<br/><br/>Feats are arranged in trees with a series of minimum requirements, stacked bonuses, and Feat effects that combo into other Feats. But it's not always clear how to maximize all the combos and finding the right Feat can mean going on a treasure hunt through dozens if not hundreds of sources. <br/><br/>Which meant D&amp;D 3E's biggest fans had bookshelves of 30+ feat books! It wasn't uncommon for these players, not the GM, to spend over $1,000 on character creation. And by focusing these books on the players, you had a larger pool of customers since for every game there is only 1 GM but multiple players. And given how much money players invested, they were disincentivised to upgrade to 4E. When a new Magic the Gathering card set comes out, your old cards don't become useless (although really old cards can but there is enough of a buffer that it's relatively painless). <br/><br/>Feat combos in 3E took heavy inspiration from Diablo 2 (the video game) and Magic the Gathering but Wizards did a great job obfuscating the direct inspiration. Where in 4E, the sources of inspiration were more naked (powers actually became cards and the game's language became more video gamey using terms like builds, defenders: tanks, strikers: dps, controllers, leaders:buffs, marks:aggro). People complain about 4E video game-ness but it existed in 3E. But how something feels is as important as what something is. <br/><br/>Multi-classing in 3E lets you be anyone. Now you didn't have to depend on the group to be a great spell caster, combat machine, or stealth master. You could be a one person army and do a bit of everything! It wasn't uncommon for people to frequently switch classes. And because the 1st level of every class were filled with amazing bonus powers (more so than 2nd level) people would take 1 level of a bunch of different classes to dip into all these benefits. And you could even multi-class into levels of monsters! I could take 6 levels of demon (technically a monster template was worth a pre-determined number of levels). <br/><br/>And even though D&amp;D is known as a game of teamwork, multi-classing encouraged players to think solo. It was all about my guy, not the team, and it was thrilling. People would spend hours making new characters that they never played. I would see people come to table and bring a folder of characters, trying to decide which to play this game. They were like decks of magic cards. But these weren't just sheets of mechanics. Every choice had fairly vibrant color. Granted the fiction behind a multi-classed librarian, ninja, barbarian, psionic, theif, ranger was strange but people seemed to have a blast trying to figure out it all fit together. Levels became more like lifepaths rather than traditional class roles and niche protection. Niche protecting was thrown out the window. But 4E threw multi-classing out of the window. Now everyone had a specific role to play. You went from being a multi-classed librarian, ninja, barbarian, psionic, theif, ranger to just a Defender. 4E killed the lonely fun and insane customization options. Now you have your role and you must work as a team. You know how in competitive card games, it's all about finding loop holes before the game company releases errata disallowing your potentially game breaking combo. 4E was like a huge errata update to 3E disallowing everyone's characters that they spent incredible amounts of money to build. But they did it all at once, rather than slowly over time to make the pill easier to swallow. <br/><br/>In 3E, the real game was character creation. The real tactics were building your character, not playing them. Although playing them was super fun because you got to test your character, see them in action, and find out if you made the right choices before the official game even started. Pre-play was a HUGE part of 3E. Even the Feat books were written in ways that were fun to read, not just use for the game. Hours of fun! Where in 4E, one of the explicit design goals was to make the game less about pre-play and more about playing with a group together at the gaming table. Tactics were focused on the game itself, not character creation. Even the books became less fun to read. It was all about play the actual game, in a very specific way, and forget the pre-play lonely fun. But that meant alienating a huge percentage of their customers.<br/><br/>It's amazing. On paper, 3E and 4E don't seem THAT different. But when you see how people play, or pre-play, the subtle differences are huge. In so many ways, 3E was brilliant but in subtle ways that don't make immediate sense. Where 4E's strengths were simultaneously much more obvious and less appealing to a huge subset of D&amp;D fans.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299982/#Comment_299982" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T06:15:59+00:00" title="November  9, 2010  6:15AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, that's a great breakdown of 3E fun vs 4E fun. 3E fun was definitely very much dependent on system mastery and optimization.

Your point's well-taken, though... I've never taken the fudging close to<i>that</i>far, but I can see why you'd have to when you take a system as baroque as D&amp;D 3.5 and THEN bolt all those lightly-playtested 3rd party bits onto it and run your game up over about 12th level where things just start to get crazy... (I was interested in Iron DM myself, they're running it at TotalCon here in MA next Feb, until I saw it was 3.5, and decided it wasn't worth the migraines of running that rules set (now 2 years gone for me) to have the story fun that could be had).</blockquote>\nI was thinking about riding up from NYC to TotalCon but I've been waiting to hear if Iron GM will be run at one of the closer NJ conventions. <br/><br/>I pretty much agree with you. A lot of what I was experiencing was also closely tied to games with the level of escalating complexity of 3E. When we play 4E, usually someone other than the GM was in charge of the rules. The DMG even suggests you can play without a GM. <br/><br/>For Iron GM, D&amp;D 3E was almost a deal killer but I talked to the people who've won Iron GM before, and others who are considered some of the best of the best GMs in organized play, and pretty much everyone said don't worry about the rules. The rules are for the players. Behind the GM screen there are no rules as long as what you do works in the players' favor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299989/#Comment_299989" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T06:41:59+00:00" title="November  9, 2010  6:41AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 9, 2010 6:42AM by jenskot.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Wow, that is crazy alien to me. </blockquote>\nAnd it's very common from what I've seen. And I don't think games like 4E were designed with this knowledge. I empathize with the design team. The whole process of what actually happens is unintuitive and if you don't play with hundreds of people, it can be easy to miss all the patterns. <br/><br/>It's like you said in the Delve thread, "in any given RPG the unshared imaginary space is way way way bigger than the shared imaginary space." This is something I've observed again and again but people are frequently surprised by it. The idea that D&amp;D, seemingly a game of playing in a group with a party of adventurers, was actually more of a solo game experience, isn't intuitive but is also partly why 3E was so successful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299996/#Comment_299996" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T07:07:56+00:00" title="November  9, 2010  7:07AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm really enjoying your thoughtful observations, John. <br/><br/>Does anybody know of a similar anthropological expedition in the other direction?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300007/#Comment_300007" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T07:57:14+00:00" title="November  9, 2010  7:57AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Player: "I stive his frikkin' head in."<br/>\nSuccess!<br/>\nGM "You stive his frikkin' head in."<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer: "I hit him"<br/>\nSuccess!<br/>\nPlayer: "I stive his frikkin head in"<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer: "I hit him"<br/>\nSuccess!<br/>\nGM "You stive his frikkin head in"<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's to do with narrative authority and black box gaming.

Friends who play this way explained this is also why they write 6+ page back stories for their characters. It's something they control, so they hope if they front load everything they care about, there is more pressure on the GM to comply. It's like asking a loaded question. Why did you kill the Ork? It puts pressure on you to agree that you did indeed kill the Ork. <br/><br/>It's a good technique for GMs to develop. Listen carefully to how actions are phrased (not just what the action is) for clues on how to narrate the results back to the players.

I'm reminded of the part of Sorcerer where Ron talks about how you sometimes need to "rewind the narration" a bit. Also Burning Wheel Task/Intent. The whole conflict resolution debate and people not getting it.<br/><br/>Or more specifically... <br/>*Player: "I hit him." ---&gt; explicit action, implicit intent. GM needs to read intent, roll resolves action (execution: yes/no), GM describes effect based on success of action+implicit intent+whatever ---&gt; GM: "You stive his frikkin head in."<br/>Or in the case of failure: GM: "You fail to hit him. Your axe goes over his head like, wooosh." (blocked execution)<br/><br/>*Player: "I stive his frikkin head in." ---&gt; explicit intent, implicit action. GM needs to probe on the action, or follow on whatever was previously narrated ("You raise your axe and..." "But I'm using a sword!" "Whoops, sorry."), the roll, as usual, resolves action (we're talking D&amp;D I guess?), GM describes Execution and Effect ---&gt; GM: "You stive his frikkin head in."<br/>Or in the case of failure: GM: "No, sorry, you don't stive his head in, your sword misses it by inches." (blocked effect, but the action/execution wasn't really specified, it could be "You smack him on the head, but it's not stived in yet.")<br/><br/>D&amp;D doesn't explicitly spell any of this stuff out, but basically, depending on how the GM runs it, the first is task resolution and the second is conflict resolution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mr%20Toad" title="Mr Toad"><img alt="Mr Toad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mr%20Toad">Mr Toad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300021/#Comment_300021" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T08:40:31+00:00" title="November  9, 2010  8:40AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was at Indiecon over the weekend and I was sat in the bar where a player was describing his game,<br/>\n<br/>\n"Yeah, I was so tired that I think I fell asleep a couple of times.

I don't have my notes with me but a few quick examples I remember...<br/><br/>- spending resources to affect dice after they were rolled was considered cheap and felt like cheating (although before a roll was fine)<br/><br/>- using traits against themselves broke their immersion and brought the game in directions they are not interested in<br/><br/>- they said they didn't like failing rolls and then succeeding anyway but with a cost but I observed that many of them (not all) did enjoy it<br/><br/>- miss effects (like in D&amp;D 4E powers) felt cheap<br/><br/>- mechanics with no fictional causes broke their immersion (although this varied quite a bit and was full of contradictions, it was more like <b>new</b> mechanics with no fictional causes broke immersion<br/><br/>- they hate, hate, hate scene resolution <br/><br/>- they don't like it when mechanics tell them how to feel, like the angry condition in Mouse Guard<br/><br/>- resource stats where it isn't clear how much money they actually have was confusing<br/><br/>- they didn't like combat mini games<br/><br/>Those are all negative examples. There were plenty of positive ones as well. Players liked beliefs, instincts, limited traits, limited skill lists, life paths, relationships, stake setting, escalation rules, being rewarded for giving up in conflicts, mouse guard style helping mechanics, world burning, freeform character creation, and a lot more. <br/><br/>I should stress that my sample size, even across 20+ people, is still too small to make generalizations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300208/#Comment_300208" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-10T03:33:05+00:00" title="November 10, 2010  3:33AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @Teataine I'm glad you did that analysis.

The player describes enough of what he does to clue the MC in to what action he's doing, rolls, and the MC tells him what happens.  Players have classes and (essentially) feats as they advance.  The MC is (very explicitly) just making stuff up behind the screen.<br/><br/>The two points that stick out to me are:<br/><br/>* Everyone is expected to do a lot more with coloring the world of the Apocalypse. Surely these D&amp;D players started that way too until there were too many conflicts of vision and it seemed easier to just let "the leader"/DM run the vision.  AW players are probably better trained to negotiate between their different visions (I think).<br/><br/>* Like OD&amp;D, AW doesn't really have enough mechanical complexity to allow satisfying solo-pre-play.  As pointed out, that's not the case in D&amp;D 3.0/3.5.<br/><br/>------<br/><br/>As a meta thought, concretely dealing with treasure -- exactly how many gold pieces did I find? what can I sell his looted chainmail for? can I buy a magic sword? is the party rich enough to buy a ship and are you all willing to share your money?  -- seems to be a big part of what leads D&amp;D in directions I don't have much fun with.    Money is the root of all evil!<br/><br/>-- edit.

Many trad GMs I've played with and observed want it so bad (and not all players want to give it) that they sometimes offer rewards. 300 XP or 10 building points for everyone who writes a back story. Other players go crazy with it front loading everything they can because it is their last chance to contribute in this way. <br/><br/>I don't think this is good or bad but one thing I've noticed is that the integration of those backstories tend to be very slow. Sometimes featuring 1 backstory per episode, but more often 1 backstory over a few episodes or even on the extreme end over a campaign. It feels more like a long novel where games like PTA, AW, MG, Smallville, feel more like a soap opera with backstories so intertwined it can become slightly comedic (although very fast paced and inclusive of the whole group). <br/><br/>A few friends who play both Pathfinder and games like PTA have said (paraphrasing), "games like Pathfinder are slower, but you also play longer, and even though parts can be boring for some people (although not for everyone depending on who has the spotlight) the moments when everything clicks... it's amazing... feels real, not forced, not something I experience with shorter games. Failing rolls, not having the spotlight, waiting for what I want... it all makes it that much more exciting when you do get exactly what you want and you don't feel it was just handed to you, it was honestly earned. Where in shorter formed games, it feels more contrived but there are also few low points, you're rarely bored but the high points don't feel as high as when I play longer form games." <br/><br/>Front loading player contribution can be a great way to reinforce and not disrupt character level play. One way I've seen trad GMs (I need to stop using the word trad, it feels lazy but easy) elicit more player input after the games has started without disrupting character level play is to take breaks. "You spend a month in the town you saved, healing up. How do you spend your time? Do you work? Train? Make friends? Enemies? Fall in love? Go on side adventures? It's up to you as long as it can be done within the month you spend in the town." By pausing the game, the GM effectively pauses character level play without disrupting it. And by saying, "you spend a month in..." sets the players expectations. "Of course we're not going to play out a month resting and healing"... it feels natural to go back into writing backstory mode, even though you are in the middle of a campaign. <br/><br/>Another GM would gather the PCs in a tavern at the start of an adventure and have the locals egg the PCs on to tell a tale of their past adventures. This was a way for the GM to get a player to deliver a prologue, Mouse Guard style, in character. And the GM would take notes: what do the players remember, what parts do they seem excited about, what parts did they forget, what parts did they choose to ignore. And then use those notes to adjust the adventure. There are many tricks you can use to coax information from players without breaking character level play!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300216/#Comment_300216" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-10T05:35:23+00:00" title="November 10, 2010  5:35AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The other thing you get with trad GMs is reams of backstory, much of which never emerges in play. For a sandbox game it's often necessary to at least have thought about what might be happening away from the characters but I'm talking about the stuff that is much less likely to get out. A lot of this, it seems to me, is a mixture of things about:<br/>- doing some exploring without interference from the players;<br/>- building up the tone of the game;<br/>- justifying their authority and privileged place in the game.<br/><br/>It's partly these last two points which come into play when the GM describes the outcome of the characters actions. Having one person describing outcomes goes a long way into maintaining the tone of the story and also maintains the GM authority over the world. On this last point, this isn't necessarily denying players creative input or control, there are plenty of ways players can add to the fiction which aren't describing outcomes of rolls, such as introducing and describing NPCs and locations, describing actions up to the point of the rolls ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300220/#Comment_300220" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-10T06:36:20+00:00" title="November 10, 2010  6:36AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm very happy to play in a game or run a game where the players' "only" contribution is describing what their characters say and what they want to do, and having a single voice narrate the outcome, based on the system.

In my long-standing group with trad-ish prefs, most players describe their intent sufficiently elaborately that all the GM has to do is either (i) agree that it takes place as they say, or (ii) explain how things don't quite work out that way. Systems such as later editions of D&amp;D that are sufficiently crunchy that narration is colour rather than meaningful are not favoured. Players prefer their system to support the GM and get out of the way otherwise. They don't want to have to learn anything "unnecessarily complicated". They particularly dislike making mechanical decisions that have no SIS correlates, because they play in Actor stance as much as possible.<br/><br/>The ability to narrate with authority is not welcomed by many of these players, because they want the objective truth about the SIS to be held by the GM alone, with players knowing only what their characters know, more or less. Given that they like and privilege Actor stance, this is a very reasonable preference. The right of the GM to overrule their narration as only intent, not execution, is central to this approach. <br/><br/>And yes, the group typically has 6 or 7 players, and typically 1 or 2 are less engaged, 2 or 3 highly engaged and the rest somewhere between at any given time. So if as a player you want less engagement, you can keep your intents simple without it being a big problem. Socially, it's a good solution, so long as enough players are reasonably engaged at any given time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300228/#Comment_300228" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-10T07:24:27+00:00" title="November 10, 2010  7:24AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 10, 2010 7:25AM by Bret_Gillan.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Have you experienced games where players never describe the results of their rolls?

They GM may be doing 50 to 90% of the work in the game. It's just way too much and it burns out GMs and makes the task daunting to new GMs. If they do it poorly the game can really suck - and burned out GMs frequently do it poorly.<br/><br/>I use to run PBM (this was before the internet) games. Players who sent in one sentence orders wanted back one sentence reports. Players who sent in a paragraph wanted a paragraph. Then there were the players who sent in pages and pages and wanted the like back. They burned me out!<br/><br/>This friction in RPG play flow is what lead me to start my version of story games over twenty years ago. Now my games share the GM responsibilities around. The GM/game host just decides what players have to roll for whole scenes to happen. Games still sometimed break down but not because the GM is overwhlemed. <br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300303/#Comment_300303" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-10T13:42:28+00:00" title="November 10, 2010  1:42PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bret Gillan</cite><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Have you experienced games where players never describe the results of their rolls?

Who cares if I ever use it in play?"<br/><br/>Do people buy Magic booster packs, get excited over cards, build decks... and then do the whole thing again without playing?</blockquote>\nYes! <br/><br/>I know a lot of people who make Magic decks and 3E characters that never play them. As I mentioned before, it's not uncommon for someone to have a folder full of 3E characters. <br/><br/>But that doesn't mean they are primarily interested in gamist / step on up / challenge play when they sit down with their friends. I've seen people who love min maxing focus purely on the GM's emerging story rather than figuring out the best way to kill a horde of goblins in the fewest rounds possible. Even though they spent hours at home making the most optimized character possible. <br/><br/>People will even buy a 96 page game supplement for 1 paragraph to help them build these optimized characters which isn't necessarily their reason for playing. But it's all fun, just different kinds of fun that are somewhat connected. The buying a supplement just for a few lines of text made up a significant number of D&amp;D sales. Which is why piracy and even the D&amp;D character creation tools hurt their book sales so much. People are happy to spend $20+ just to scratch the itch of seeing what new thing came out, even if they won't use it. It's not rational but is emotionally pleasing (and thus worth the money). But piracy allows people to scratch the itch without paying. It makes sense (I'm not saying it's right) that so many of these players would move to piracy since they were spending so much money before for so little.Which is why splat books need to have more varied content of interest, fun to read, and useful beyond what the character creator offers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300614/#Comment_300614" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-12T13:31:50+00:00" title="November 12, 2010  1:31PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MatrixGamer</cite>The one thing about this traditional RPG play flow that always strikes me the most is how much freaking work the GM has to do as compared to the players. They GM may be doing 50 to 90% of the work in the game. It's just way too much and it burns out GMs and makes the task daunting to new GMs.</blockquote>\nIt's also a potential cause of railroading. If it takes hours to design balanced encounters and creating NPCs takes almost the same time as making PCs, then the GM may become reluctant to abandon all that work when the players try to move in a different direction. Efficiency wise, it doesn't make sense to have games require large amounts of prep and then tell the GMs if they don't abandon that prep when needed, they are doing a bad job. It's a mixed and conflicting message.<br/><br/>It's one of the reasons why Skill Challenges in 4E didn't work for many people. You don't want the players to fail a Skill Challenge so that they don't get to play that encounter you spent so much time prepping. But at the same time you don't want succeeding a Skill Challenge to give players advantages that will unbalance the next encounter so it takes 15 minutes instead of an hour to play through. The game almost encourages a form of railroading so that limits what Skill Challenges can realistically let you accomplish. In Essentials they changed Skill Challenges so that PCs always succeed them. This way they always make it to the next prepped encounter. Playing a Skill Challenge mainly determines how many resources you lose. <br/><br/>It's very easy for me to improvise Mouse Guard because I spend 10 minutes prepping.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300615/#Comment_300615" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-12T13:34:13+00:00" title="November 12, 2010  1:34PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude, now I am so filling my game with marginal combos like, "If you have a background in irrigation and another one in smithing with the "tin-wright" option selected, then you can be your region's only drainage pipe contractor, adding one penny per day to your income when you travel within the region."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300650/#Comment_300650" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-12T21:35:41+00:00" title="November 12, 2010  9:35PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>The game almost encourages a form of railroading</blockquote>\nI don't think it's controversial to say that, by the book, 4e is all about railroading.

The Air Traffic Control metaphor is a good one, and I don't think there's too much wrong with a game telling my character what to want, on some level, so that the game can happen. A game should have a core scenario type\u2014the dungeon crawl or the shadowrun, for example\u2014that makes it easy for every player to connect their character to what's at stake and to get everyone facing the same direction. <br/><br/>Consider the nonlinear dungeon. It's a classic limited sandbox design. Engaging in prewritten encounters does not a railroad make. And I've found it plenty easy to improvise D&amp;D encounters by simply keeping a few on-level monsters in mind to flip to in the book at any time. <br/><br/>As for Skill Challenges, I think they work fine in the hands of a DM that's not afraid to skip an encounter or otherwise reward PCs\u2014or to feed them a real consequence. The thing is, you can't package instinct and judgment calls in the DMG, so systematizing Skill Challenges isn't so easy. They can be a language for conflict modeling. Again, in actual play, I've had some success having Skill Challenges reduce encounters to 15 minutes (a blessing, that!) or triggering optional encounters on success or failure. It just requires a level of improvisation and a willingness to sacrifice that not all DMs are assumed to have, I think. <br/><br/>I could go on, but I'm at risk of derailing this thread already.

(I'm GMing Gamma World soon and having a hard time understanding how things could go sandbox--like, if I have a bunch of pre-prepped encounters, and the players can pick which ones they want to do, what if they pick one that's too easy, or too hard? What if they level up and go back to an easy room? Doesn't that lead the way of non-fun? It seems like the only way it would work is if they do the encounters in the order that I've planned them. But I haven't GMed 4e and have barely played it, and anyway, this isn't the point of the thread, so we can move along).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300768/#Comment_300768" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-14T13:22:05+00:00" title="November 14, 2010  1:22PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I remember this sort of strange game that sprouted off of 3ed. At a few PAX events they had "DnD tournaments" players would construct a character according to a strict rules set and then arena duel other players. I think most events were split into magic classes and non-magic classes. think of it as a hyper complex one on one miniatures game.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me this speaks to the lonely fun of building with limited systems. like figuring out the best possible combination of six pokemon. some people really enjoy that sort of thing. it's a safe/easy form of creativity. really thats kind of what buying game books is about, they make creativity safer and easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the context of an rpg I think it's less about competition and more about looking for moments where the choices of character creation are allowed to matter, like finding the right combination of feats that let your level 5 character attack twice in a round!<br/>\n<br/>\non another matter<br/>\nyou know when train tracks are used for fun it's called a roller coaster, not a rail road.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300769/#Comment_300769" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-14T13:27:26+00:00" title="November 14, 2010  1:27PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If someone wants to start a new thread, I would love to read how people balance non-railroady 4E games with prepping challenging encounters. <br><br>And thanks everyone for commenting in this thread so far.

How common is it?</blockquote>Pretty common. I'm running Apocalypse World right now and that's how that works. Oh and the Burning Wheel game I'm playing in works like that too.<br><br>I'd just like to point out (however your group plays is fine) that according to the book in BW, the player describes successful outcomes and the GM describes failures.<br><br>Technically, Burning Wheel has nothing to say about who narrates the result of tests. What it does say is that when a test is successful, the character completes the action in the manner described by the player when stating his Intent and Task before the roll. The GM is explicitly given the power to embellish. <br><br/>So really, either the player or the GM (or both!) could jump in after the roll is made to narrate what happens, so long as they remain true to the Intent and Task behind the test in the first place. It's not about designating narration rights, it's about ensuring that the result of the roll is true to the player's stated intent and task.<br/><br/>In my experience, since the player always states the intent behind the test and how he plans to accomplish it up front, it seems very natural after the roll for the GM to embellish a bit to fit the action into the larger context of what's happening in the game and then move on. I have no problem with any or all of the players jumping in with additional embellishments. It often adds a lot of flavor.<br/><br/>I often find that games that are more methodical in assigning narration rights are somewhat awkward in play. For instance, while I'm a big fan of Nine Worlds, one of the things that often felt forced during play was the way that each player who won points in a conflict was required to add a bit to the narration. Groups that in games with no specified narration rights would supply easy and free flowing narration of the results of a conflict would suddenly struggle with it in Nine Worlds, where the narration was more systematic. Something about being put on the spot, maybe?                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P

The primary flight differences are cost, connections, and layovers.  All of the 4E published modules I'm familiary with start by giving you a variety of handwavy reasons to start you in Chicago and then a variety of potential "hooks" whose only purpose is to give everyone an excuse to be willing to go to Orlando.  But after that, there are generally multiple different flights you can take...as long as Orlando is your ultimate destination.</blockquote>\nRalph, I don't want to drag this too much further off topic, but check out The Slaying Stone by Logan Bonner. It's a 1st level adventure that is actually quite good. You have a mission (a quest in 4e terms), but the adventure location is incredibly dynamic, and players can tackle it in any number of ways.

This is where things like DnD fail big time. It's common for players to narrate what they would "like" to do. It then falls to the GM to arbitrate if they "can" do that and what rules are in effect. This means players are always narrating with uncertainty.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnytime I hear some DnD gm extol the virtues of being able to run an adventure without teaching a new player any of the rules I want to slap them. That player may have had fun, but they have probably spent a few hours in uncertain confusion and have absolutely no idea how to recreate that experience on their own. and they wonder why the hobby is shrinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think all it takes is a little inspiration and support.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300842/#Comment_300842" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-15T08:10:06+00:00" title="November 15, 2010  8:10AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TylerT</cite>thor O said<br>"I often find that games that are more methodical in assigning narration rights are somewhat awkward in play.

More support and inspiration is definitely nice, but it's not going to help someone who just plain doesn't want to do it, and even the most supportive and inspiration-filled rule won't help when it's telling that person "Oh, but you must!" whenever they would prefer not to.<br><br>One thing that always baffled me about the explosion of narration-passing mechanics is the blanket assumption that narrating is fun for everyone.  I don't think that's true: I think that like everything else in the wide world of leisure, different people have different ideas about how much fun it is, and support and inspiration can only do so much in the face of that.  Which in turn makes me feel better about games with no specified narration rights than I do about ones that are more methodical about it: as a gaming group, we can find our own happy medium, open enough to let people who enjoy contributing narration do so when they want to, without pressuring everyone to do it.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300857/#Comment_300857" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-15T09:48:29+00:00" title="November 15, 2010  9:48AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually had this happen this weekend, the player who was unhappy with the edition of game I was running (we were playing D&amp;D 4E) and bitched about it the entire time. It ruined the experience for me as the GM. I put a lot of time and effort into prepping a very fun and exciting adventure, and he fought me at every turn, not because of story or railroading or anything like that, but because he constantly wanted to do things outside of the game rules, and when I said "well, in this game you would do x and y to get that effect" he would do a "that is stupid" rant for a minute, then throw his hands up and say "whatever."<br><br>At one point I rules a move he wanted to do wouldn't work and showed him why mechanically. He said "we're talking about physics here!" and I responded "so says the dwarf attacking a zombie."<br><br>At the end of the game, everyone else talked about how much fun they had, when could we play again. He pipes up and says "Good game. That was fun." I nearly threw up.<br/><br/>Back to the OP's topic specifically on the GM describing an outcome, during these games it tends to be a combo. They tell me the attack, and I describe the effect, in part because that gives them an idea of how close to Bloodied they have made the opponent. In that context, me describing the effect of their roll is important mechanically. <br/><br/>But if I say "You drop him" the player is just as likely to say "I take his head off with my double sword strike" and I'm like "awesome!" That happens too.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300860/#Comment_300860" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-15T10:08:09+00:00" title="November 15, 2010 10:08AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 15, 2010 10:12AM by Matt Snyder.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thor O</cite><br/><br/>I often find that games that are more methodical in assigning narration rights are somewhat awkward in play.

I know the kind of thing you're talking about here, and it can be jarring or interrupt play, sure. These days, I'd have designed it slightly differently.<br/><br/>But, that leads me to the second point. My experiences up to designing Dust Devils and Nine Worlds were very  much the D&amp;D "Player rolls, GM describes ... " type play. So, I decided that it'd be really cool if a game made people talk instead of the GM. I mean, sure, some groups already did all that, but wouldn't it be neat to let some of these players open up their spoken contributions to the game? <br/><br/>So, it's funny you bring it up in this thread. These two things are pretty closely related. Neat.<br/><br/>EDITED TO ADD: \n<blockquote>One thing that always baffled me about the explosion of narration-passing mechanics is the blanket assumption that narrating is fun for everyone. I don't think that's true: I think that like everything else in the wide world of leisure, different people have different ideas about how much fun it is, and support and inspiration can only do so much in the face of that.</blockquote>\nAnd, baffling to me right back atcha. Don't mean to be confrontational. All I mean is, I designed such games with no assumption like that in place. Rather, I was thinking "Huh. Very few games do encode narration, so I think I'll do it and widen the choices out there in my small way." Of course, it was always meant as a thing that people with different choices could enjoy among the other variations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300867/#Comment_300867" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-15T11:03:36+00:00" title="November 15, 2010 11:03AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt,<br/><br/>I totally get why you were exploring that space.

And I've seen it really suck. I've even seen it done really well, where it's tons of fun MOST of the time. (Dave and John, you'll both remember my account of the Mutants and Masterminds game I played last year: perfect example!)<br/><br/>John, the part that really strikes me is the part where you identify one really popular part of play as the moment when the GM has everyone sit down for the next dump of plot information, or maybe even a recap. Everyone sits quietly as the GM "tells the story". But it's one of the few times when everyone is really keen and paying attention. For me, in those games I'm just excited to see the story unfold and for the plot to move along. The parts in-between are often just so slow that I know I will be phasing out or reading a book or waiting for my turn for a long time, so the GM infodump is a definite highpoint. (Then again, I feel that way about a lot of computer/video games: I get bored of the actual gameplay and am happy to get to the next cutscene/plot development.)<br/><br/>But I wonder about the fun thing. I've been assuming that people are NOT totally enjoying it, even if they're getting a lot of good fun out of it. John, I believe you when you say that the people you observed looked like they were having a great time. But were there any hints of dissatisfaction?<br/><br/>In my experience, people were having a good time, but even in the best games of this sort someone was getting disappointed at least a little bit all the time. Why do I say that? Well, for instance, some examples of what I consider clues:<br/><br/>1. If and when the players would write backgrounds/histories for their characters, those stories were usually more cool/more compelling/more dramatic than what actually happened in play. Every single person I ever spoke to about it really wished that they could see more of whatever was in those character backgrounds in play. But they usually seemed to rationalize that as impossible, and thus were happy to keep playing as is, and indulging their daydreams through character backgrounds, character illustrations, character builds, etc., without an expectation of those dreams showing up in actual play.<br/><br/>2. You know all those players who are reading books or walking away from the table, or zoning out because they're drawing something? In the groups I'm thinking of, all those things were expected and accepted activities at the game table. Yet, nevertheless, I can only think of one GM who wasn't constantly trying to fight that tendency, or complaining about the players who "don't care" or "can't even remember my NPCs' names". And I think he just got tired of complaining about it. I don't think that situation (people falling asleep during the game, or reading books while waiting for their turn) represented ideal play for any of the people involved, even though they were accepted as normal.<br/><br/>3. Pretty much all those groups would experience "GM burnout", where whoever was running the game was just too tired after a while and wanted to play instead (including myself, even though I was happiest as a GM in those groups). It was just so much work and overhead for the GM, coupled with a low sense of return from the players (e.g. people reading during the games, or not showing up, or not being interested in important details of the Big Plot), that GMing was in large part tough work, and would wear down even the most enthusiastic GMs sooner or later.<br/><br/>4. In a similar vein, in groups with rotating GMs each new pitch of a game would be described as "better because it has [A] and/or doesn't have [B]", with A and B being things like "more realistic gun damage", "more roleplaying", "fewer classes", "a longer required page count for character backgrounds", "realistic travel rates for horseback journeys". It was very rarely "I'm going to run a campaign, and I hope it'll be as much as Linda's was!" Usually, it was, "OK, but THIS TIME it's going to be better because of [A]." Even if said players felt that they really enjoyed the previous games.<br/><br/>And this goes for groups where everyone GMs in turn, too, not just those groups where one person is the GM and the others are "mere players". I haven't seen a huge difference unless those players have been exposed to other cultures of play and maybe other games (if those games are different enough).<br/><br/>Those things give me a sense that these games are never living up to their expectations, even if people ARE enjoying them, and even a good deal so.<br/><br/>Does that match your experiences or not? I'm aware that I could definitely be projecting my own biases onto my fellow gamers here...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300938/#Comment_300938" name="Item_113" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-15T20:12:46+00:00" title="November 15, 2010  8:12PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A separate post about "lonely fun":<br/><br/>I remember doing those character designs, although I was never quite as into it as some of my friends.<br/><br/>I think a big part of it was the firing up of the imagination. Just like writing up a backstory, statting up your character got your imagining future fun. "Wow, my guy is the last surviving member of a lost race!" "Wow, my guy has the highest strength score possible for his race! He must be famous for his might!" But also, "Wow, my guy can attack twice as often as most characters of his level! He's going to quickly develop a reputation as a badass warrior!"<br/><br/>For me and my friends, at least, those numbers related to the fiction. Maybe you wouldn't get to decide how the story turns out or make important choices for your protagonist (especially if the game was really heavy on the GM fiat), but there were some things you could hope to accomplish. Like being able to cast that one spell or deliver that killing blow, or seducing that important noble when it counts. And if you're not getting a chance to describe your success in narrative terms, at least you can guarantee it in numbers: instead of describing how hot and sultry your character is to show what an awesome seduction is going down, you could drive that point home by pointing at your monstrous +25 modifier as you roll the dice, and watch your friends' jaws drop in awe in reaction all the same. <br/><br/>Even if you fail, or the GM doesn't sell it for you, you got that reaction by reading that number off your sheet. No one can deny the power of your character's seductive charm. (And if the GM does, a player in this type of game usually arches his or her eyebrows and says, "Really? The NPC doesn't react? Come on, my character has a +25. Are they gay?" <br/><br/>Also: this is why it is SO much more dramatic if it's a surprise unveiled in the heat of an important moment in the story!<br/><br/>So it's a bit of one-upmanship but also a bit of trying to achieve greatness and dramatic events in the fiction. You've been planning to use that seduction score for the last 20 sessions, after all, and now, finally, it's paying off for you!<br/><br/>That's what I think a lot of those players are thinking when they design their characters: "Ooh, boy, I just can't wait to pull out this +25 at just the right moment and save the day!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300945/#Comment_300945" name="Item_114" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-15T23:32:53+00:00" title="November 15, 2010 11:32PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite><br/>2.

I believe Judd will back me up on that.   And I'm drawing what is happening in game at the table, characters, or monsters or what have you.<br/><br/>I just can't help myself.  If I don't draw, then I doodle on the margins of my character sheet... and it ends up being really messed up.  So I always bring my box of pencils and pens and blank paper to games these days.  <br/><br/>I actually miss drawing at the table when I GM, but I'm too busy juggling to do that.<br/><br/>As for rolling the dice... GM describes... I bristly a bit at this as a player.  There are times I want to describe the action or reaction.  I remember a 4E game where I kept coming up with ideas in my head for description and have it overridden by the GM before I could state it.  Drove me a bit nuts.  I started blurting out before him, just so I could get my vision of color down first.  And that was all it was... simply color.  It didn't confer world changing ideas nor mechanical advantages.... just color.  I do have a real keen sense of fight choreography due in no small part to my love of drawing comics.  My mind is just geared that way and it was not easy to take a back seat.   <br/><br/>As a GM, I often turn to the player after a die roll and say 'describe the outcome please'.  If they dont' have anything, then I step in.  If it is a reaction of an NPC, who I have fleshed out, then I will describe... if it is an NPC that has evolved on the spot by player and GM cooperation, often I will let the players describe the NPC reaction to the die roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff" title="Michael Pfaff"><img alt="Michael Pfaff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff">Michael Pfaff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300960/#Comment_300960" name="Item_116" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-16T06:22:35+00:00" title="November 16, 2010  6:22AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite><br/>Even if you fail, or the GM doesn't sell it for you, you got that reaction by reading that number off your sheet.

I'm guessing that most gamers look at an RPG as Action Castle/a video game, only with the GM as an infinitely more creative and reactive computer. Both those ideas are a little off, of course, but I still would think most gamers think that's the "ideal" for an RPG. I know my groups did. It sounded like an exciting and unlimited field of play--one you can immerse yourself in and get lost in.<br/><br/>It reminds me of Dave (Berg)'s "world goggles" concept. Except Dave's aware that there are other things that happen in an RPG.<br/><br/>I still like that ideal to some extent, but it carries the very real danger that the players forget (or do not realize) that they are responsible for bringing some of the fun and the drama to the table.<br/><br/>As a test, ask your gamer friends if players can ever narrate/describe anything in play. Especially an outcome in a fight or something similar. Most, in my experience, say, "Absolutely not!" With the exception of describing what their characters looks like, of course. They do not seem to realize that saying, "Natural 20! I totally chop his head off!" is actually narrating an outcome. (Again, in my experience. And if confronted, they would deny that it is narration, anyway, since they're ready for the GM to refute/change/edit whatever they said anyhow: they see that "I totally chop his head off" as more of a *guess* about what is about to happen, which must then be confirmed or denied by the GM.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300994/#Comment_300994" name="Item_120" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-16T10:45:04+00:00" title="November 16, 2010 10:45AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>A Penny For My Thoughts</i> really turns IIEE on its head - the current protagonist narrates everything until his character speaks or does some big, significant action - that action being, essentially, something one might "roll for" in a game about relationships between regular people. <br/>Instead of speaking or acting, the player asks the others what it was he said or did, and then each other answers in turn with a suggestion.

But those weren't the guys buying books and optimizing builds and writing backstories for their characters.  All my players who ever invested in that way clearly <b>wanted to invest in the game</b> too, it was just a question of how.  They didn't want plot or narrative authority.  They just wanted their character performance -- skills, choices, personality, badassery, luck -- to matter.  <br/><br/>Since I had my plot and was going to run them through it no matter what they did, I had to look for other ways for them to matter.  This wasn't fully conscious.  It was more like just <b>being a polite conversationalist</b>.  You know, when someone talks, you should actually listen, and if they're excited, you should be encouraging and try to catch the excitement if you can.  If I wanted them to listen to my GMing and react, it was only fair to reciprocate.  And I did want them to listen.  Or, ya know, at least 4 of them.  If we'd foolishly assembled a 7-player group, I was resigned to a player or two not listening.  But in a small group, I'd consider it quite rude: "Hey!  I'm talking to you!  Don't pick up a book!"<br/><br/>Anyway, due to a failure to establish a group creative purpose, <b>giving players ways to matter came down to different things</b>.  For Al, it was winning the (winnable) fights with engineering cleverness.  For Marc, it was befriending or intimidating the (tractable) NPCs.  For Dan, it was getting NPC and PC reactions to his character's cool looks and outrageous behavior.  For Cyp, it was fighting with his bladed tail.  Vic flip-flopped between sharing tastes with Al, Marc, and Dan depending on his mood.  Johanna just wanted to hang out, so she mostly tuned in for the character interactions, like discussing what to do next.<br/><br/>So I tried to accommodate these, filling the world with colorful NPCs that weren't vital to my plot, and also being willing to sidetrack from my plot for PCs' pet projects.<br/><br/>Thus <b>play was a sort of exchange</b>.  They gave me an audience for my cool story, I gave them (largely via NPCs) an audience for their cool characters, they followed my plot all the way, I followed their mini-plots for a bit, and most people stayed engaged most of the time.  <br/><br/>My plots were fairly intriguing (lotsa conspiracies), and I paced my reveals well.  And they portrayed their characters in an entertaining fashion.  I'd like to think that any group that can do that can find ways to turn roleplaying into a functional conversation.

I played Rifts and In Nomine but play was really mediocre and we had more fun making characters and talking about the characters than actually playing.  The most fun the players had was when I wrote out a whole binder worth of railroaded crap to play, but that was incredibly not fun for me, as GM.  I was so, so ready to discover Dogs in the Vineyard and have barely looked back since.  But then I never could stand Final Fantasy games (the boredom, the grinding, the pointlessness!), despite all the beautiful story and beautiful characters.  And every single time I've tried to drift games back into more GM authorship (as happened at various points in both of the 6-session Mouse Guard games I've run in the past couple years) it's made the games worse instead of better, both from a social and narrative standpoint.  Maybe I'm just a bad GM or something, but every single time I've tried to run or play in a more traditional game, it hasn't really worked.  So, despite the widespread prevalence of this type of play, it's never really worked for me in practice.  <br/><br/>It's really hard to know whether that's innate or something socialized or what.  Why do people ultimately gravitate away from more traditional styles?  For me, it was partially frustration and GM burnout and I'm much, much happier now, for the most part, but I was never really all that happy in the first place.  Why did I bother sticking with it, then?  Instead of giving up and doing something else both hipper and more fun?  Hard to say.  But that's probably another thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301009/#Comment_301009" name="Item_123" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-16T12:24:27+00:00" title="November 16, 2010 12:24PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 16, 2010 12:25PM by jdfristrom.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

Here are some of my answers:<br/>* For the first 2+ years, I didn't know that hippie games were such an awesome alternative.  I liked Universalis but I liked trad playing more.  I hadn't experienced In a Wicked Age or Geiger Counter or Lady Blackbird yet.  As boring as our play sometimes got, it beat staying home and watching TV.<br/>* They're my friends.  I like hanging out with them, even if it means sometimes being bored.<br/>* There's a few ex-Wizards game industry luminaries in the group, and I get off on being able to say "I play Pathfinder with so-and-so" - I guess that makes me the roleplaying-game equivalent of a star fucker.  I don't like this about myself but have to admit it's there.<br/>* Some sessions are great.  Fights where it feels like we're almost not going to survive;  some sessions that aren't about the fighting.<br/>* Although we allegedly play every week, it often gets cancelled, so I can get my hippie game on on the off-weeks without giving up my long-running tactical combat fix. (Strangely, I'd be more likely to quit if we played more regularly.)<br/><br/>I actually did threaten to quit a couple of weeks ago, and that provoked a flurry of other complaints, and now we've changed some stuff up.  If the change-ups really help I'll write a post about what we did and how it worked out.  If not, I really will quit...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301023/#Comment_301023" name="Item_124" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-16T14:25:31+00:00" title="November 16, 2010  2:25PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Dave:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>My plots were fairly intriguing (lotsa conspiracies), and I paced my reveals well.

Except it sounds like it was fun and worked full on for you.<br/><br/>Whereas for me/us, it was kind of like a game of Achilles and the Turtle. We were getting better and better at it, and our ratio of non-fun to fun was approaching 0... but it was a lot of work, and it never quite got there. It was never predictably, reliably fun. The gaming didn't always deliver; just often enough to keep us hooked (they say intermittent rewards are more powerful than consistent rewards, don't they, the psychologists?).<br/><br/>If I'm at the game to deliver cool dialogue, I AM bored when Joe is getting his blade-tail die rolling on. And if I'm there for the plot (as GM, say), then I'm bored during the pointless in-character planning scene. (Those can be fun, but not if you've been waiting for two weeks to get to the next important turning point in the story.)<br/><br/>Were you always the GM in this style of gaming?<br/><br/>Because I know I found it %300 more reliably enjoyable as a GM than as a player. But it still fell short when I felt like I was delivering a cool plot, but wanted the players to come forward for that last 10% of it, and they just didn't, or weren't interested.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301192/#Comment_301192" name="Item_125" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-17T22:21:31+00:00" title="November 17, 2010 10:21PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, apologies if you've answered this question somewhere in this thread before, but: in what format were these games?

When I was a player, I was often the guy trying to come up with a plan that was so clever that dice rolling would be unnecessary or a mere formality.  At the same time, I never liked long breaks in the progress of the fiction, so I did get bored when planning went on and on.<br/><br/>There were some dull moments, but overall it wasn't bad.  It was a lot like having a conversation with friends who have varying interests.  I might not care that much about Rachel's biology class or Andy's annoying client, but I'll do my best to participate, and they'll do their best not to monopolize the conversation.  Similar deal with Cool Dialogue Guy and Blade Tail Boy.<br/><br/>If I went back and played this way today, I'd probably say, "Fuck this," because I know I've got better options.  But, lacking better options, it wasn't half bad.  "Reliably, predictably fun" would only be a slight overstatement, and as far as GM putting in work, I only did the kind of work I liked (more cool backstory and plots!).<br/><br/>I dunno, maybe we're talking about the exact same experience, but the downsides of it bugged you more than they bugged me.

No one can deny the power of your character's seductive charm. (And if the GM does, a player in this type of game usually arches his or her eyebrows and says, "Really? The NPC doesn't react? Come on, my character has a +25. Are they gay?"</blockquote>\nI literally had this happen in a game I was playing in. It was 4th Edition D&amp;D. I had optimized my Intimidate. I rolled a 30 (at like level 5 or something - actual roll was a natural 20 + 10) on an Intimidate check. The NPC literally did nothing. My Intimidate was flat out denied.<br/><br/>The reaction was there from the players. "Woah! Good roll!" But, the DM had nothing for me. Sad.<br/><br/>I quit the session after.<br/><br/>I've quit a few con and local games under almost the same circumstances. It used to ruin my experience and I would stop the game to say something but I found I was ruining everyone else's experiences by doing so. It hasn't happened in a long time as I've gotten better at pre-qualifying GMs but when it does I try not to say anything till after the game. <br/><br/>It's one of those strange things that's common although done independently and seemingly naturally occurring (it's not learned or taught). It's not that dissimilar to when you roll grapple to subdue an NPC and the GM rules you kill them. Or you knock someone unconscious but the GM says they hit the ground in a way that they die.

Everyone sits quietly as the GM "tells the story". But it's one of the few times when everyone is really keen and paying attention. For me, in those games I'm just excited to see the story unfold and for the plot to move along. The parts in-between are often just so slow that I know I will be phasing out or reading a book or waiting for my turn for a long time, so the GM infodump is a definite highpoint. (Then again, I feel that way about a lot of computer/video games: I get bored of the actual gameplay and am happy to get to the next cutscene/plot development.)<br/><br/>But I wonder about the fun thing. I've been assuming that people are NOT totally enjoying it, even if they're getting a lot of good fun out of it. John, I believe you when you say that the people you observed looked like they were having a great time. But were there any hints of dissatisfaction?<br/><br/>In my experience, people were having a good time, but even in the best games of this sort someone was getting disappointed at least a little bit all the time. <br/><br/>[snip]<br/><br/>Those things give me a sense that these games are never living up to their expectations, even if people ARE enjoying them, and even a good deal so.</blockquote>\nIt's difficult to say. I've seen people enjoy themselves while simultaneously being disappointed. A lot of pressure is put on the GMs who run in the styles we're describing. And when groups are as large as 8-10+ players, it's implausible to integrate everyone's back stories and meet everyone's expectations. Especially when the style of play sometimes forbids players from helping out the GM during play. <br/><br/>It's unfair for me to judge people's level of fulfillment over a single instance of play. I suspect over multiple sessions we'll see a different picture. My suspicion is someone's expectations are always unmet, but eventually over multiple games they will be met. This style of play requires a lot of patience. Which may mean playing a few games that aren't amazing for you personally as build up to the game where you get everything you want and more. <br/><br/>My question would be, does it matter if people are disappointed in specific ways if they feel fulfilled otherwise to the point where it makes the experience worth it overall? <br/><br/>And does it matter in an environment where a game is more like a party... show up, hang with a very large group of friends, roll dice, eat junk food, watch TV, read a book, deliver a speech, kill some orks, play halo, roll more dice and then listen to the wrap up where you get to find out what happened when you weren't paying attention in a very concise way that is sometimes more fun that playing out every moment? <br/><br/>For me, this style makes sense under those circumstances.<br/><br/>I think for me the disconnect happens when the habits and techniques developed under those circumstances are applied in situations where they don't fit as well. For example, a 4 player game where players are more invested and want to participate more. I think problems start to happen when you don't use the right tools for the right job.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301284/#Comment_301284" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-18T10:48:47+00:00" title="November 18, 2010 10:48AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>It's one of those strange things that's common although done independently and seemingly naturally occurring (it's not learned or taught).

Often they are friends from high school, college, work, or are related somehow. They usually live and game where they grew up. And most of the players wouldn't play RPGs outside of the group. It's a casual thing they do with the friends they grew up with and not something they would do with strangers. Usually people come and go as outside life pulls them away (moving away, new relationships, new job, school, children) but as their lives free up they jump back in. So the number of players is fairly unpredictable. <br><br>I think the points to keep in mind is these are long term friends, the games are more like parties, they are very casual gamers (most of them have never bought or read a rulebook), and hanging out with friends is more important than the game itself.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301352/#Comment_301352" name="Item_139" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-18T20:43:29+00:00" title="November 18, 2010  8:43PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 18, 2010 8:43PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess I can sort of see that.<br><br>I've been in that situation too: ultimately, our decision was to not game and do something else instead, because all of the problems that come with running a game for 8+ people were becoming a serious drag on the fun of spending time together.

Let me check, actually...Yeah, Men and Magic says "one referee and 4 to 50 players", Moldvay says 4-8, Mentzner just says it's usually played in groups of 3 or more people. It's obvious there must have been a certain shift in between. I think the huge numbers that the original booklets mention are also what gave rise to the "Speaker" role for the players. The players deliberate between them and the Speaker conveys their actions to the DM.<br/><br/>Also funny when you consider that Warhammer 3E got a lot of bad press for saying explicitly that the box has stuff for GM + 3 players. Or maybe 4, I don't remember, it's besides the point. A lot of people got pissed at that, but it's not like games work well with more than 4 players anyway, at least in my experience. I often struggle even with 4 when I GM, especially when the players are all there to do different stuff and I can't accommodate them all at the same time.<br/><br/>One of my friends used to play Vampire a lot in another group. I think she said there were often 8+ people there, sometimes as much as 12. When she was a Storyteller for us, the plot was mostly all pregenerated, with little cutscenes we couldn't really interact with and stuff. Makes sense to me now, given her background. She was telling a story for an audience, but since we were only 3 other players at the table, each with his own agenda, instead of 12 passive participants...<br/><br/>Some groups handle this by introducing co-GMs or just share the work in various ways. Frex, in our group it was the resident optimizer's job to handle the rules aspect. If something was iffy we asked him. If someone wanted character-building advice, they went to him. Lifted a tremendous burden off the DM. Other groups have co-GMs that play their own character but also take on the roles of NPCs and are "in on it" with the GM, using their PC to further the story. Certainly makes things more manageable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301414/#Comment_301414" name="Item_142" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-19T06:19:35+00:00" title="November 19, 2010  6:19AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why, uh, why not just run more than one game concurrently?<br/>S'what my Thursday night group does... <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>Does that solution breach Geek Social Fallacy territory, though?<br/>/ducks                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grymbok" title="Grymbok"><img alt="Grymbok" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grymbok">Grymbok</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301418/#Comment_301418" name="Item_143" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-19T06:35:24+00:00" title="November 19, 2010  6:35AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite>Which is funny, when you think that oD&amp;D talks of numbers like 5-50 players or something like that.

You wouldn't have 50 people at a table at once, but they might all be involved in the same campaign, with different players turning up to each session.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite>Also funny when you consider that Warhammer 3E got a lot of bad press for saying explicitly that the box has stuff for GM + 3 players. Or maybe 4, I don't remember, it's besides the point. A lot of people got pissed at that, but it's not like games work well with more than 4 players anyway, at least in my experience. I often struggle even with 4 when I GM, especially when the players are all there to do different stuff and I can't accommodate them all at the same time.</blockquote>\nIt's a tricky balance. I agree that many/most games struggle beyond the 4-5 players zone, but on the other hand I've found that with anything less than 5 players it can be hard to keep the game going if people have to miss a session. We have 4 in our group now which works pretty well for the games, but we miss more sessions than when we have 6.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20L" title="Dave L"><img alt="Dave L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20L">Dave L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301419/#Comment_301419" name="Item_144" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-19T06:51:53+00:00" title="November 19, 2010  6:51AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think one reason the "Caller" role was there to help get rid of people backtracking on their actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe DM would describe the scene, sit back, then wait for the Caller's official presentation of what the PCs were doing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301421/#Comment_301421" name="Item_145" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-19T07:26:27+00:00" title="November 19, 2010  7:26AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 19, 2010 7:26AM by jenskot.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite>Which is funny, when you think that oD&amp;D talks of numbers like 5-50 players or something like that.

Many of these larger groups had a person acting as a "Caller" who walked the players through all the rules and served as a gateway between the players and the GM. The Caller handled most of the rules while the GM focused on the plot and NPCs. Although not every group I participated in had a Caller, many of the players indicated that in their other games it was quite common.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite>One of my friends used to play Vampire a lot in another group. I think she said there were often 8+ people there, sometimes as much as 12. When she was a Storyteller for us, the plot was mostly all pregenerated, with little cutscenes we couldn't really interact with and stuff. Makes sense to me now, given her background. She was telling a story for an audience, but since we were only 3 other players at the table, each with his own agenda, instead of 12 passive participants...</blockquote>\nYes! I've also found many of these groups used to LARP together where 10, 20, 50+ players weren't uncommon. Which makes 8 players in a tabletop RPG seem small! And they were often setup so players can drop in and out as needed and there were frequent review periods to summarize what's happening since not everyone was present or even involved in the main plot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301422/#Comment_301422" name="Item_146" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-19T07:38:28+00:00" title="November 19, 2010  7:38AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @ zak<br/>\n<br/>\nmy guess would be most groups dont split because d20 and games like it require lots of prep, hard for most groups to wing running a game. it's easy to whip out an extra board game, rpgs not so much.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat i'm more interested in now is what does a story game look like that actually serves the 6-10 player casual party range? hum i feel the start of an idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301423/#Comment_301423" name="Item_147" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-19T07:41:37+00:00" title="November 19, 2010  7:41AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How many players can Fiasco effectively support?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301425/#Comment_301425" name="Item_148" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-19T07:51:16+00:00" title="November 19, 2010  7:51AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Davis</cite>Why, uh, why not just run more than one game concurrently?<br>S'what my Thursday night group does... <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br>Does that solution breach Geek Social Fallacy territory, though?<br>/ducks</br></br></br></blockquote>\nA few people I spoke to said they tried splitting their large group into 2 smaller groups but it failed. I wasn't there to observe first hand so I can't comment beyond what I was told. But they said it failed for many reasons.<br><br>Only 1 person wanted to GM consistently. The more hardcore players wanted to stick together which meant they ended up with a 2nd group of casual players that was often canceled since attendance was so unpredictable. Even when they were able to evenly distribute hardcore and casual players, there was less pressure to start and end the games at the same time and the groups started growing apart. Which meant they were losing out on their <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> goal... to hang out with their friends, now they just got to hang out with a subset of their friends... since was their only weekly play date. And the experienced changed. It became more focused, more manageable, but it was less fun for them, felt less like a party, and was more serious that they were interested in being. <br><br>Ultimately out of a group of 10+, it was usually just 1-2 people who wanted something different. It made more sense for those 1-2 people to do something else rather than force the larger group, the 8+ people to do something they weren't interested in. They all had limited free time, and they wanted to make the most of it. There was just a small subgroup that had different priorities. At first they tried to paint it as a problem the entire group had, where in actuality it was just a problem a small number of people. <br/><br/>It was similar with my high school friends. I was the minority. But I learned to stop being selfish and trying to make people want what I want and rather accept them for who they were. It's tough!                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301426">\n<div

I did try and split that into two groups playing at different times. Some players wanted to be in both groups. Ultimately, one of the groups faded and the game continued with a more reasonable number of people (6 or so, maybe 8).<br/><br/>I used to have a sweet spot of about 6 players. That was heavily driven by tactical games where reasonable formations that allowed some characters to stand inside a circle required 6-8 characters.<br/><br/>These days, I'd say my sweet spot is 4 players. Less than that, and gaming with one player missing is quite a challenge. My current Burning Wheel game with 5 players may be pushing things a bit, but we were just able to have a nice session even though one player wasn't going to be able to make it and another player couldn't find my house (we usually play at someone else's house).<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301439/#Comment_301439" name="Item_152" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-19T09:06:40+00:00" title="November 19, 2010  9:06AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TylerT</cite><br/>What i'm more interested in now is what does a story game look like that actually serves the 6-10 player casual party range? hum i feel the start of an idea.</blockquote>\nAction Castle and the Parsely games are one way to do it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301454/#Comment_301454" name="Item_153" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-19T12:10:09+00:00" title="November 19, 2010 12:10PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 19, 2010 1:40PM by johnzo.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            necro'ing a comment from way back...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite><br/>...turns out I didn't have an Axe even though I was a walking armory with laser swords and more. The GM was annoyed I didn't check to see if I had an Axe first. I thought, no problem. Can we say I had an Axe since I seem to be the best person in the universe with an Axe or is there maybe an Axe or an Axe-like weapon laying around in this war zone I could use? The GM was not happy! I crossed some line that I didn't know existed.<br/><br/>The GM berated me about being an indy game player and how we expect things too easily. He listed as an example that I would probably expect my character to have a car if I am the best driver in the world.</blockquote>\nThis feels very GURPsy to me.  GURPS' point-based character creation explicitly separated resources and skills, so you could very well be the best driver in the world and not be able to afford a car.  Hero and M&amp;M work pretty much the same way.<br/><br/>I am not a theologian so please forgive me if this sounds ridiculous, but It seems to me that GURPS is loaded with Judeo-Christian subtexts.  GURPS players are assumed to be fundamentally flawed, stained by their wargaming ancestors with the original sin of munchkinism.  The game cannot function unless a law and a powerful lawgiver govern those base impulses.  Good citizens will self-police and will not tolerate sinfulness.  All the GURPS players of my acquaintance rebuked powergamers with the same vehemence that jenskot relates.<br/><br/>GURPS has your Protestant work ethic going too: nothing is free, everything has a price, and only through the careful accumulation of character points over a long career can a character achieve its ultimate potential.<br/><br/>So, it might not just be a gaming preference that is being assaulted here, but in fact a worldview. <br/><br/><sub>I hope that's not too inflammatory a thing to say. </sub> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301456/#Comment_301456" name="Item_154" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-19T12:52:18+00:00" title="November 19, 2010 12:52PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm pretty sure gaming preferences and worldviews are inextricably entangled.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mule" title="Mule"><img alt="Mule" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mule">Mule</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301457/#Comment_301457" name="Item_155" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-19T13:31:30+00:00" title="November 19, 2010  1:31PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah I used to do this hardcore as a GM, back in the day.  My most potent example was a time when there was a fight between 5 players and 5 NPCs, and I was coordinating the types of attacks and movement into a larger narrative.  "Oh you missed him because he was still ducking to avoid the arrow from before, but that left him open to this new attack!"  Stringing together the narrative result of smaller actions into a larger scale of cause and effect, basically, until at one point a player said, "No, I don't uppercut him, I'm striking him with a *downward* blow."  I tried to casually shrug the contribution off, but he was not to be dissuaded.<br/><br/>I was <b>stunned</b>.  Why would the player be doing this to me?  How could a *downward* blow work with what happened before and what would happen next, when it was totally clear that an *uppercut* was the natural flow of battle?  Even if there was a way to make it work, how could this player ask this of me?  Couldn't he see how hard I was working to maintain the narrative on a larger scale?  Did he really think I needed this extra workload of not just fitting all the mechanical actions together, but now shaping the flow of battle to incorporate this fluff of his?<br/><br/>What the hell man, I thought we were <i>friends</i>?<br/><br/>I admit that even at the time it really struck me as weird that I would feel this way.  Of course my friend would have a vision of his character's actions and feel like he should be in control of his part of the narrative.  He just.. he just didn't understand the stupid, crazy, broken system that was *forcing* me to marginalize his input.  Oh, what a terrible world that would pit two such reasonable and steadfast friends against each other.<br/><br/>Anyway that was years ago, and since then I've growth in my ability to listen.  One important thing to me is no longer feeling a responsibility to ensure things like an entertaining narrative regarding the flow of combat, or even just an entertaining narrative in general.  These days I know it's not my job to safeguard and ensure the fun, and I play games where I actually understand what my job as GM *is* so I can just focus on doing that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301459/#Comment_301459" name="Item_156" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-19T13:41:11+00:00" title="November 19, 2010  1:41PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave,\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>There were some dull moments, but overall it wasn't bad.  It was a lot like having a conversation with friends who have varying interests.  I might not care that much about Rachel's biology class or Andy's annoying client, but I'll do my best to participate, and they'll do their best not to monopolize the conversation.  Similar deal with Cool Dialogue Guy and Blade Tail Boy.<br/><br/>If I went back and played this way today, I'd probably say, "Fuck this," because I know I've got better options.  But, lacking better options, it wasn't half bad.  "Reliably, predictably fun" would only be a slight overstatement, and as far as GM putting in work, I only did the kind of work I liked (more cool backstory and plots!).<br/><br/>I dunno, maybe we're talking about the exact same experience, but the downsides of it bugged you more than they bugged me.  Either way, I think what I'm describing was fun for me in a way that John's games of intermittent attention wouldn't be.</blockquote>\nYes, it does sound to me like we're talking about exactly the same kind of experience! Sounds very familiar to me. The catch involved in "lacking better options, it wasn't half bad" was two-fold for me:<br/><br/>1. Sometimes the parts where you're listening to a friend talking about something you're really not interested in coincided with exactly the parts I (or others) cared most about. Like if, say, one player's obsession with the minutiae of 17th-century firearms completely deprotagonized an important character, destroying their chance to make a pivotal decision they'd been building up to for six months. <br/><br/>Extreme example, but that kind of thing would pop every now and then. Have that happen to you once or twice in each game you play in, and you start wondering why, and, you know, can't this game be better?<br/><br/>And no one had any idea what to do about it, which brings me to the second problem:<br/><br/>2. It seemed that all efforts made to improve the situation did not lead to actual improvements. Efforts put into making the game more fun, or, more often, more *reliably* fun very quickly met with diminishing returns. Usually it was the GMs making those efforts (with one notable exception being extra-length, extra-drama character backgrounds), and this would lead to inevitable feelings of burnout or "not being appreciated".<br/><br/>The reliability factor was also a big question for me when it came to playing with different groups. It always bugged me that these games were so unpredictable, especially with different groups of people--but also within the same group and an ongoing "campaign". <br/><br/>So, yeah, sounds like what you're describing, exactly. The "downsides" were more issues of ease of play (how much work needs to be put in to get a certain amount of fun out of the activity) or issues that concerned those players who wanted their play to improve over the long term than total dealbreakers.<br/><br/>I had a lot of fun in many of those games. What eventually killed it for me was playing in a bunch of games which were a TOTAL BLAST some nights and a total bore other nights. I was heartbroken and torn half the time about whether to show up at all or quit. Given a very free schedule and little to do, this was acceptable, and a good excuse to hang out with friends. Since sometime around the middle of high school (a long time ago, now), that presented a very serious dilemma--I am not one of those people from whom college was a fun and relaxing social time, and my "fun time" was, and continues to be, an expensive commodity.<br/><br/>Like you say, having better options is a joy. And I guess I was always looking for those better options, from just about the beginning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301479/#Comment_301479" name="Item_157" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-19T16:19:53+00:00" title="November 19, 2010  4:19PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh.

I just feel like I'm experienced at harnessing a player's vision and respecting it without letting it rampantly undermine, say, the menace of the bad guys. Still, I probably hog the spotlight a bit. <br/><br/>One trick that I do, though, which works for me: When a monster is defeated (e.g. in D&amp;D), I put the cap on my pen (from tracking HP) and I say: "What happens to it?" or "What do you do to it?" or "It's yours. What do you do?"<br/><br/>This gives the player a chance to describe something akin to a finishing move\u2014a grand or heroic or brutal or merciful (or whatever) declaration of her character's style and methods.

Naturally there must be some effortless doing, some wu wei, and the reduction of almost all complicated situations to a single 3d6 roll, almost always meant to be low, is the very soul of wu wei. (To the degree that some things, like reaction rolls, break this action-without-action flow, GURPS has not yet approached the true Tao.)

My gaming (since perhaps mid-way through high school) has been a rare event, and, unlike those "Sex Is Like Pizza"(TM) Gamers, I never felt that there was no such thing as bad gaming. When I make time for a game, I want it to be good, dangnabbit. Because it's not often that I get to play, and that time and effort is often dearly bought. <br/><br/>I remember when I was very young--there was a period when we would just get together with friends several times a week to hang out and play. Given that we were playing so often, there was a lot less pressure to have something great happen every time. In that kind of situation, we were happy to play, or not to play, or to goof around, because really we were just hanging out.<br/><br/>Which brings me to your other point:\n<blockquote><br/>Or maybe my friends were just more fun to hang out with than yours.  :P</blockquote>\nSpot on, as well. Not that all my friends suck (after all, you are one of them), but many of the games I'm thinking of included people who weren't really, really good and close friends. Some were fun as gamers but not necessarily as much fun as just straight-up people. That sounds like some weird judgement to make, but really all I'm saying is that we weren't the closest of friends. When a group of really great friends get together, it's a different situation, and, of course, if we're all just really happy to see each other then it doesn't matter how great the game is because we're just enjoying each other's company.<br/><br/>Still, it's important to me to figure out how I can make a game consistently fun. Because if we're going to play an RPG but not really get to the shit, you know, I'd rather we just did something else (like play frisbee with homeless people in the park).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301533/#Comment_301533" name="Item_162" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-20T08:28:24+00:00" title="November 20, 2010  8:28AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Friendship and time are huge factors!<br/><br/>Many of the groups I played with met weekly, for years, and were mostly all close friends.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301535/#Comment_301535" name="Item_163" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-20T08:32:37+00:00" title="November 20, 2010  8:32AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mule</cite>Yeah I used to do this hardcore as a GM, back in the day.  My most potent example was a time when there was a fight between 5 players and 5 NPCs, and I was coordinating the types of attacks and movement into a larger narrative.  "Oh you missed him because he was still ducking to avoid the arrow from before, but that left him open to this new attack!"  Stringing together the narrative result of smaller actions into a larger scale of cause and effect, basically, until at one point a player said, "No, I don't uppercut him, I'm striking him with a *downward* blow."  I tried to casually shrug the contribution off, but he was not to be dissuaded.<br/><br/>I was<b>stunned</b>.  Why would the player be doing this to me?  How could a *downward* blow work with what happened before and what would happen next, when it was totally clear that an *uppercut* was the natural flow of battle?  Even if there was a way to make it work, how could this player ask this of me?  Couldn't he see how hard I was working to maintain the narrative on a larger scale?  Did he really think I needed this extra workload of not just fitting all the mechanical actions together, but now shaping the flow of battle to incorporate this fluff of his?<br/><br/>What the hell man, I thought we were<i>friends</i>?<br/><br/>I admit that even at the time it really struck me as weird that I would feel this way.  Of course my friend would have a vision of his character's actions and feel like he should be in control of his part of the narrative.  He just.. he just didn't understand the stupid, crazy, broken system that was *forcing* me to marginalize his input.  Oh, what a terrible world that would pit two such reasonable and steadfast friends against each other.<br/><br/>Anyway that was years ago, and since then I've growth in my ability to listen.  One important thing to me is no longer feeling a responsibility to ensure things like an entertaining narrative regarding the flow of combat, or even just an entertaining narrative in general.  These days I know it's not my job to safeguard and ensure the fun, and I play games where I actually understand what my job as GM *is* so I can just focus on doing that.</blockquote>\nThanks for sharing this!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301562/#Comment_301562" name="Item_164" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-20T14:31:29+00:00" title="November 20, 2010  2:31PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TylerT</cite>what is the perfect "hanging out" rpg?</blockquote> I'm interested in this too.

Lots of players want to describe want they want to do, then see if they succeed according to the system (which is in fact (system+GM)). I find some tradtional players will front load the colour and effect quite happily at the intent stage, and the GM will comply. This doesn't seem to bother anybody. You are basically pre-narrating your success. If you are playing a game with trad players, get them to try this, and watch their little eyes as you validate their narration.</blockquote>\nYes!<br/><br/>I've seen this quite a bit and I'm really glad you brought it up. Friends who play this way explained this is also why they write 6+ page back stories for their characters. It's something they control, so they hope if they front load everything they care about, there is more pressure on the GM to comply. It's like asking a loaded question. Why did you kill the Ork? It puts pressure on you to agree that you did indeed kill the Ork.<br/><br/>It's a good technique for GMs to develop. Listen carefully to how actions are phrased (not just what the action is) for clues on how to narrate the results back to the players. Reincorporate to confirm and reward their creative input.<br/><br/>I spoke to a few of the players yesterday about front loading and they made an interesting observation! <br/><br/>First they agreed that it is very common when they play. It allowed them to guide the GM without breaking from character centered play. The problem they frequently found was it made whiffing even more frustrating. <br/><br/>Games like D&amp;D are designed for you to fail 40-60% of the time. Failure typically means nothing effectively happens. You miss and you don't move backward or forward towards your goal and neither does your opposition. You don't have to make misses = nothing, but most people do. Add D20s have a flat 5% chance of rolling any result and your fixed bonuses are usually negated by your oppositions steadily increasing difficulty. So it's not uncommon, even if you expect to fail or succeed 50% of the time, for you to have a game session where you fail almost every roll. Which is balanced by game sessions where you seemingly succeed every roll and score multiple natural 20 critical successes! It can be quite exciting!  <br/><br/>But for those whiff filled sessions, front loading narration can grow tiresome. You can only say "I jump off the table, spin around, gnaw my teeth and swing down... chopping it's head off" so many times with nothing happening before you retreat back to "I swing my sword" ::rolls::. <br/><br/>Ultimately they considered this the price of entry to play the game. Everyone takes turn having bad and good nights. <br/><br/>I mentioned that there are games where you can fail and still succeed with a price and they said they've tried those games and HATE them! It feels like cheating. They call them cheating games. Action / Hero / Drama / Fate points that allow you to affect an action result after you rolled are considered Cheating Points. But points that allow you to adjust your odds before the roll are considered not only acceptable but something they love! They mentioned this was one of the reasons they dislike D&amp;D 4E and stuck with Pathfinder, D&amp;D 4E has too many power miss effects which they felt were cheesy. <br/><br/>That said, their GMs sometime let them describe how they finish off their enemies where the final blow reduced them to 0 hit points.The thrill of winning the right to narrate this one moment often drives them to endure 1-2 hour long combats and they will compete with each other to attain this glory! They said they were ok breaking character centric play to grab full narration because they worked hard to earn it and it was rare.<br/><br/>Edit: Cross posted with Colin saying similar things!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301627/#Comment_301627" name="Item_168" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-21T07:47:58+00:00" title="November 21, 2010  7:47AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One reason this style is common is that players will often go a bit overboard in describing the effects of their characters' actions.

The more casual players who drop in and out have less invested in the games and less preferences. They aren't the people calling Fate Points... Cheating Points. Usually they describe something, then someone else tells them what to roll, they have no idea what the roll means, and they patiently look to everyone else to see what happened. They often don't make characters by themselves and play pre-gens or get help from more experienced players.<br/><br/>The more invested players were fairly diverse. Mostly male (but not all) with diverse ethnic backgrounds, jobs, families, who all grew up in drastically different places. Some were immigrants or first generation, and there seemed (from what I could tell) an even ratio of people who grew up in the suburbs vs cities. Fairly diverse but they did have a few things in common...<br/><br/>- mostly college educated<br/>- between ages 30-40 (skewing closer to mid 30s)<br/>- there first RPGs were not original D&amp;D or the Red Box<br/>- they generally started D&amp;D with Advanced and played mostly 2E<br/>- their favorite games growing up were Star Wars, Vampire, Marvel Superheroes, and Shadowrun<br/>- they loved Dragon magazine<br/>- before 3E, they had not played D&amp;D for many years... 3E brought them back to D&amp;D<br/>- they don't like 4E<br/>- they LOVE Pathfinder<br/>- some never GM although do buy and read game books<br/>- they like reading RPGs as a form of fiction <br/><br/>I'm not sure what the above tells me although it does seem fairly common among Pathfinder players I've met.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301634/#Comment_301634" name="Item_171" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-21T08:16:17+00:00" title="November 21, 2010  8:16AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>I mentioned that there are games where you can fail and still succeed with a price and they said they've tried those games and HATE them!

Once they've played a little, I let them know that character monogamy is sort of standard (so they don't get slammed by the weirdness of it when they play again with another crew) but I don't discourage their way.<br/><br/>There's something interesting going on with this - as a community we actively reject the most intuitive approach to the activity. Hmm.<br/>This is really common! I've gamed with many people new to RPGs and one of the first bumps is limiting narration. It's common for new players to describe beyond the scope of their character. It's completely understandable. Which Is another reason I've been surprised by so many long term gaming groups aggressively prohibiting even describing the results of your own character's actions.<br/>Over the past few years, I\u2019ve gamed with a few people new to roleplaying, and I\u2019ve seen this happen over and over.  New players get excited about narrating the actions of their characters and, every time they get to roll dice, tend to give these inspired, embellished accounts of what happens, only to have their contributions quashed by the person running the game.  Blowing the roll doesn\u2019t help\u2014this was discussed upthread\u2014but I\u2019ve seen game masters specify to a new player that it\u2019s not his or her place to describe the character\u2019s action as such.  Their responsibility is simply to announce an action and roll a die\u2014the GM is in charge of the rest.  The resulting loss of enthusiasm is tangible and unnecessary, given how needless the dichotomy the GM chooses to enforce is to the success of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301820/#Comment_301820" name="Item_178" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-23T00:17:27+00:00" title="November 23, 2010 12:17AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 23, 2010 12:19AM by TylerT.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            seriously this kind of stuff is why my game only lets people narrate AFTER they roll, all this requires are a few clear choices for how players can act. narrating after a roll saves so much time and never realized narrative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301846/#Comment_301846" name="Item_179" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-23T07:28:10+00:00" title="November 23, 2010  7:28AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daniel, I think it's possible to channel that enthusiasm in a couple of different ways, so as to not totally squander it.<br/><br/>1 - make the full description a demand you're making of play. In Polaris (I know, I know, I always go there), you deliberately make the most far-flung claim possible, to see how much you can get away with during the negotiation process. You push hard, forcing your opponent to get in gear and find a good way to make you compromise, lest he have to give you everything you asked for. <br/><br/>2 - have rolls that address the conflict at the heart of the situation, or at least at the heart of this moment. Instead of giving us a detailed idea of how your ax tears through his shield and into his chest, why not say, "I strike him with my ax <i>so that...</i>, and roll to see whether or not striking him, with your ax, does that thing. You can still with the ax, even if you fail the roll; the point of the roll, in this sort of mechanics, is to settle whether we get the prize that's lurking behind our actions. Or, in Forge parlance, use Conflict Resolution. <br/><br/>A secondary effect of using Conflict Rez for combat is that players can evoke the right amount of fighting skill when describing their characters, but without always winning everything. If my character is a master fencer, it'd be weird and annoying to have him totally flub his sword-fighting skill checks. Not that he'd never make a mistake, but if your character is supposed to be talented at something, then the dramatic tension comes from "But does he defeat the guards in time to stop the high priest's ritual?" rather than "Does he defeat the guards?", leaving the question of "Does he do it in time to stop the ritual?" up to the GM or something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301862/#Comment_301862" name="Item_180" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-23T08:20:36+00:00" title="November 23, 2010  8:20AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Zac, I'm totally down with you here.

They are tightly woven into the bonds that hold people together and by extension their play (especially playing RPGs that can become a form of moderated discussion and is heavily social in nature).<br/><br/>How quickly new people, strangers, adapt to these friend groups often determines acceptance or rejection. It's like having a party where the host wants you take your shoes off but doesn't want to have to say it (or it's so standard they never think people would ever enter your home without taking off their shoes). It's up to you to notice that everyone else has take off their shoes. And often the people who don't, aren't confronted, or reminded, and even if you ask if it's ok and they say it's up to you, they sometimes don't mean it and have a very specific preference. Instead of direct communication, you will simply not be invited back after a few instances of these unsaid rules being broken. And even if it may be helpful to have a formal list of what not to do, I would imagine being handed a huge checklist upon entering someone's home might be off putting (even if it's honest). <br/><br/>Playing games is like any other social interaction. You may need to verify, by asking or observation, that it's ok to narrate your die roll just like you might have to confirm if it's ok to grab a glass from the cabinet or ice from the freezer. It's best not to assume, even if asking what the lines are may feel weird. And even if in your house, and your family's house, and your coworker's house, and your 10 other friend's houses it's all done 1 way, it may not be that way somewhere else (even if the other people assume everyone else does it the same way they do it). Hell, even in the same house, even when everyone agrees to act a certain way, doesn't mean they want to, it's often all about compromise to keep the large whole intact. <br/><br/>As a stranger among friends with predefined but unsaid codes of conduct reinforced by years of habit formed in isolation from what other groups may accept as normal, I can't take for granted that I'm the outsider. And although I personally am a strong believer in compromise, adaption, one size doesn't fit all even if the majority wears one size, that doesn't mean my beliefs are shared or even wanted. I'm the guest in someone else's home.<br/><br/>That's a lot of text just to say... these groups weren't the ones acting weird. <b>I was.</b><br/><br/>And it may seem small, but it's the social glue that holds friends together and reinforces their group identity. That's powerful stuff to mess with... and my preference is to proceed with caution, respect, and understanding.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305071/#Comment_305071" name="Item_182" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-18T11:11:49+00:00" title="December 18, 2010 11:11AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 18, 2010 11:12AM by Teataine.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome, awesome stuff, John.

I think the possibility of this weirdness from asking for something that is assumed to be true, is a justifiable trade-off for the advantages of asking about something that might go against the grain. <br/>I agree, I think the trade off is worth it but it almost always feels weird, especially at conventions. <br/><br/>As a player, I almost never play D&amp;D at conventions (even if I'm in the "I want to play D&amp;D" mood). Mainly because it feels impossible to know what a game of D&amp;D will actually be like. It can be anything (so can any game, but especially D&amp;D). Maybe we use maps, maybe we don't. Maybe it's 100% fighting, maybe it's 75% freeform. Maybe the rules matter, maybe they don't. Maybe I'm allowed to describe how my character fails or succeeds a roll, maybe I'm only allowed to say my intent with some pre-roll description and then roll and have the GM do all the rest. Maybe it will be cinematic or maybe it will be treated like a historical simulation where the GM loves to include plenty of racism and sexism to make it feel more real even though there are also dragons and magic. <br/><br/>It's hard to know before you sign up, and when you do, the conversation of what to expect can be awkward especially if the people involved don't think about these issues or have experience playing with different people. <br/><br/>This is actually one of the reasons why I almost exclusively play Indie Games / Story Games / Design Matters Games / Games people designed who also post on this forum. Generally I can somewhat ascertain what the game will be like from the game itself. I have a better chance of knowing what to expect if I sign up to play Dogs in the Vineyard. Although to be fair I've signed up for Dogs games where the GM ignored many of the rules, said we are all secretly atheists, didn't use Fallout, it was a giant railroad, and I couldn't narrate what happened to what was at stake in conflicts I won. So there are definitely exceptions! <br/><br/>Generally speaking I prefer when a GM is clear via their event description of what to expect. If I was running D&amp;D 4E with no map, I would make sure to say so. But I'd like more ways to communicate what to expect without too much awkwardness (although I'll pay the price of short term awkwardness for better long term social cohesion). <br/><br/>Dave Berg has players fill out individual surveys before a game of Delve and then customizes the game as needed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305272/#Comment_305272" name="Item_187" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-20T15:23:40+00:00" title="December 20, 2010  3:23PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tavis</cite>I've seen you do this to great effect when we were playing PTA, jenskot - you were like "is it OK if I yank your character's chain?" and I was grateful for the heads-up; I wouldn't otherwise have made the right assumptions and was glad for the invitation to get on board with what you were doing.

Even when you ask permission and try your best not to be persuasive towards a particular answer, it's hard for someone to say no. I think asking permission is better than not asking, but I think there are good and bad ways to ask.
