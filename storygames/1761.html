                    Here is a little scenario I want you all to ponder and then respond to. You have just purchased a game, it is now in your hands with all its bells and whistles. You are completly satisified with your purchase. You can't wait to digest everything you have there, and then gather whatever players you will need and play it. This game is going to be great. <br/><br/>This game cost you $80.00<br/><br/>What would this hypothetical game need to do, have, feature, come with, etc in order to validate it's $80.00 cost? Is it big? Is it a board game with tons of cool minis? Is it some sort of killer software that interfaces with live play? What does it take to get that big chunk out of your pocket and still leave you happy?<br/><br/>And none of that nambsy-pamsy "As long as it's a good game, I would pay any price" bullshit. We aren't having that here. We're talking about flash, we're talking about gloss, we're talking about inverse price consideration. Get to it you monsters.                </div>

                            comes with a cd that actually has useful stuff on it?  It would definitely need to be more than just a book.  Perhaps include all you need to play the game: deck of cards, poker chips, beads, pencils, pads of paper.  Then sell it all in fairly compact, durable box.<br/><br/>--Nancy                        </div>

                            Art.  Lots and lots of beautiful artwork.  No filler, just amazing full-color illustrations that drive home the essence of the game experience.<br/><br/>Maps.  Lots of them.  Nations, cities, worlds, galaxies, whatever.  Big, glossy fold-out maps that my players can pore over and scrutinize.<br/><br/>Setting.  Everything I need to run the game for the next few years.  Save me the trouble, as a GM, of inventing all of this stuff.  I want rich, detailed setting laden with game hooks.<br/><br/>Monsters.  Hundreds -- no, thousands -- of enemies.  Strange, repulsive, foreign creatures whose very descriptions will give my players pause.<br/><br/>I'd shell out eighty bucks for the above.  Hell, I've done it, just not all at once.<br/><br/>-- Rafael                        </div>

<p>Well, here I assume it's an analog roleplaying game:</p>
<p>It's a cloth-bound book. There's something beautiful on the page edges - gilding or a stamped design or something. The front cover is embossed and the paper is heavy, not glossy, has a bit of tooth. It has a ribbon bookmark. It's typeset in a cool, uncluttered way; no awkward things like sidebars, borders, and scattered pictures. There are full-color, full-page plates here and there, but illustrations only come into contact with captions and never with running text.</p>
<p>It comes in a box, covered with matching cloth, with all you need to play the game. Maybe there is a bundle of yarrow sticks or a string of three coins, or a deck of custom cards. There's a nice heavy gameboard, again backed with matching fabric, with tokens and things to move around on it.</p>
<p>It's imperishable and beautful; something that I can leave out on display in the middle of a game and have it ornament the room, and something that my children can inherit.</p>

                            I have no point of reference.  I have literally never gone into buying a game intending to spend that much.  I don't have any sense of what could pull that amount of money out of my pocket at a go.<br/><br/>I mean, yeah, White Wolf milked me for way more than that, but that was a whole "death of a million cuts" thing.                        </div>

                            Here's my requirement list for an $80 game:<br/>
<br/>
1. Unlimited replay value.<br/>
2. Very fun.<br/>
3. Instant play (by which I mean that within 60 seconds of deciding to play, I can have a game going...including the time to find other players, so we're obviously talking online or telecomm or something).<br/>
<br/>
So far, there's no game out there that fulfills these qualifications for me. Yes, that means there's no game I'd buy at the $80 price point.                        </div>

                            I think BattleLore is retailing for $70; start there as a reference point in terms of design, production and presentation of a game.  I've got a pre-order, I know it will be worth the price already.  I actually knew the minute it was announced - DoW has a reputation for excellent production, Richard Borg has a reputation for excellent design.<br><br>Yesterday I looked at the slipcased Bill Watterson collection - three oversized Calvin and Hobbes volumes beautifully laid out, $120 - and thought 'I could imagine buying that'.  Scarcity is at work there, of course - I hunger for the content, which isn't easily available in that form.  It'd be a wonderful <i>object </i>to have around and enjoy.<br><br>The cost of entry into, say, GURPS is probably around that - two 256+ page color hardcovers.  Of course that path is eased by freebies, GURPS Lite, etc.  Same with D&amp;D, right?  There's a de-facto standard for pricing those kind of books, so if I were excited about getting into those games, I don't think I'd blink at the cost (I'd probably share it with my friends, though).<br/><br/>$80 means different things to different people.  There was a time in my life, not so long ago, when an eighty dollar price tag might as well have required Elf Moon Magic - it was complete impossibility.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            I've dropped $80 in a game line several times:  D&amp;D, Vampire, Buffy, GURPS, and so forth.  I don't see a difference in principle between spending $80 on a single product versus $80 on two or three products if they have similar content.  <br/><br/>So I think the main barrier for me would be <i>knowing</i> in advance that it was a game which I'd want to drop that much money on.  <br/><br/>That said, I personally would prefer having a boxed set with a number of components rather than a single giant hardbound book.  Especially being able to hold the introductory adventure to myself while players pass around the character generation booklet is extremely useful.                        </div>

                            I have a hard time knowing what I would pay $80 for. I do it for software &amp; textbooks, sure, but RPGs?...<br/><br/>It would definitely require having everything I need to play included.<br/>I would probably consider a "normal" product that included some snazzy software for this price.<br/>I would also <i>expect</i> (require?) a purdy-looking book for $80.<br/>I would also expect long-term replayability for that price.<br/>I would also have to be assured that the game was going to be good.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what else. But you know, as another data point, Ron likes to point out that the <i>complete</i> Socerer collection (corebook + Sword, Soul, &amp; Sex) is $65. If he only sold his books (as-is) as a collection for $65-$75---I, personally, would probably pay it. [edit] <i>Let's be honest---who else would do the same?</i> [/edit]                        </div>

                            these are great answers. Keep em coming.<br/><br/>Jason, Tony, i agree with your sentiment entirely. I fixed the mark at 80 because its out of my bugitary range. I can't afford an 80 game (i mean i could pay it, but i can't fathom it). I'll spend way more then that this year on games, but i'll get lots of them. <br/><br/>The 3 dnd core books cost $90.00 and insane # of gamers have purchased them.<br/>A game console costs anywhere from 4-almost 9 times that amount.                        </div>

                            I think my number one criteria for purchasing something that large is that it satisfies an unfilled social niche.<br/><br/>I purchased <i>Memoir 44</i> so that I would have something on hand that was specifically designed for two players but which was component rich (as opposed to something simple and elegant like chess or go).  I purchased <i>Caylus</i> for nights where we only want to play a single sprawling board game.  I purchased <i>Jungle Speed</i> for filling in short periods of time.<br/><br/>You want $80 out of me?

Same here. BattleLore looks awesome and seems awesom from the demo, but I doubt I'll buy it barring some sort of windfall.<br/><br/>Even more realistically, your could sell me four $25 products much more easily and walk away with an extra $20.<br/><br/>You could make a lot more than that as the price drops below $25/unit, as proven by some embarassing miniarure and ccg collections I've had over the years...                        </div>

Fair enough.  I fall prey to impulse purchases as well, but I strictly limit them.  I'm probably similar in that I'd consider a single $80 purchase more carefully than four $20 purchases.  However, the impulse is much less strong in me, so I'd certainly consider larger books.  <br/><br/>Still, I'm curious about your feelings about the single Sorcerer book.  For example, if a retailer were selling a "Sorcerer pack" which had Sorcerer and the supplements for $50 as separate books, would you consider buying it then?                        </div>

Not as an impulse purchase. It's the lump-sum thing that gets me. Different prices get examined differently. A purchase of $20 or less doesn't really get looked at any more carefully than passing the test of "Do I <i>want </i>this?"                        </div>

                            $80 is a serious break point.<br/><br/>$80 = Everything Burning Wheel + Burning Empires (more or less). I own this because the setting inspires me and because it's something I bought intending to get a lot of use out of.<br/><br/>$80 = Upgrade to latest edition of Warhammer 40k (rules only). I didn't make this bump. The book is worth it from a production value standpoint. Then again, the only reason I need to buy it is because I can't play Warhammer 40k with my friends any more because THEY all made the bump. Leaves me feeling manipulated.<br/><br/>$80 = Play two months worth of Magic: Online at my chosen rate (that's two one-month leagues). Steep as it sounds, that probably averages an hour of intense competition every day. This is something I do at least once a year.<br/><br/>What it comes down to is this. For $40, I'll buy a great game. For $80, the game has to be part of how I define myself as a gamer. It has to be a game that's definitive for my group, or that I intend to develop for my own purposes, or that gives me a big chunk of personal satisfaction. Right now I'd pay $80 for a big fat book of Solar System materials with lots of secrets and keys and maybe a couple of settings or a book with 100 gorgeous full color maps that I can use for something.                        </div>

Dammit, beat me to it.<br/><br/>I think that <i>Ptolus</i>, more than any other prestige RPG product I've seen, is a perfect example of a worthwhile high-end RPG book. An excellent mix of <i>quality</i> and <i>quantity</i>. A lot of prestige products tend to understand one, but not the other.<br/><br/>(Interestingly, I think another big selling point of <i>Ptolus</i> is that we know for a fact that there will likely <i>never be any more products in the line</i>. I.e., I'm not being invited into another supplement treadmill. The value of the artifact will never be diminished by splats or revisions that counter/negate/update the content within. I can't feel "burned," because this is it.)                        </div>

                            For that price, I expect a full "kit" of fully branded and evocative materials. The dice can't be generic, nor can any other materials included in the kit. Every single item should convey a consistent brand experience.                        </div>

                            I was going to mention Ptolus also. Also look at Arcana Evolved at $50 (and note that you still need the Monster Manual and DMG). The D&amp;D core book set is $90.<br/><br/>Hmm, Ptolus being the end of the line... Not hardly... There are PDF supplements coming out for it on a periodic basis. Plus, I'm betting we'll see some full fledged modules come out. Just because Monte will not be writing any more RPG books (for some time), doesn't mean he won't license his IP to others.<br/><br/>So I guess for my $80, I would either expect the complete core rules to a game with a scope similar to D&amp;D, or I would expect a game with a smaller scope packaged complete with a good setting book and at least something in the way of scenarios.<br/><br/>In general, I'd prefer not to see dice in an RPG. I have more than enough dice as it is (I understand their need in a board game). Miniatures would be nice (but if they're included, I'd prefer they be pre-painted - and they had better be of long lasting usefullness to the game if a signigicant part of the package).<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>

The supplements seem to be mostly things like adventures, maps, counters, etc. I'm not aware of plans for actual setting-expansion stuff, a la FR or Eberron.<br/><br/>My point is, Ptolus is basically a "done deal" product, not a gateway product. This appeals to me. If ti was the first in a line of $100 books, I probably would have been more hesitant to buy it.                        </div>

                            It would, as so many people have said, come with all the goods to play.  It would have to be pretty enough for me to want to just hold it and admire its features and durable enough for all my friends to do the same without it falling apart.<br/><br/><b>Most importantly</b>, though, I would need to know that *I would* be playing it very, very soon and for many sessions--in other words, I need to know it is something that a bunch of other people (that I like) want to play it right now and into the near future.  That is why I was willing to fork out the bucks for D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Which leads me too: when Ptolus became the flagship Monte Cook product (ie dominated his design discussions, his advertising, etc), I started caring a whole lot less about visiting his site.  I was simply never going to buy that book.  I looked at it at Gencon, admired it, can acknowledge it's beauty and organization, but still can *never* see buying it.  I can't imagine the world in which I would make enough use of it.  That sort of detail has never gelled with my playstyle--I can't see myself using it, extensively, with my friends, so it isn't even on my radar.                        </div>

                            I've want to track down the 1989 swiss rpg Laborinthus, which is described as being about "Onirism, symbols, psycho-analysis. Very beautiful, with many original engravings and eau-fortes, but of course very expensive. I mean very expensive (around $100, not refunded by Social security)!" <br/><br/>This makes it sound cool, although I needed to look up what onirism meant, presumably the act of describing a world that you can't see.<br/><br/>The world's largest dungeon cost $100 retail and apparently sold thousands of copies.                        </div>

                            I purchased the books for AD&amp;D circa 1978-79. These cost, as I recall, $12 each. Maybe more for the DMG. Let's call it $36. I applied it to an inflation calculator I found here: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.westegg.com/inflation/" rel="nofollow">http://www.westegg.com/inflation/</a><br/>
<br/>
That's $101.94 today. Three hard covers, cruddy art, ramshackle design.<br/>
<br/>
Somehow people think that they should still be paying the same prices for RPGs that they paid in 1980, or whenever they discovered them. So, er, sorry, but as long as it's a good enough game, I'd pay any price. Well, at least $80.<br/>

                            For $80.00?  All at once?  <br><br>I don't want little pieces that scatter, get snarfed by the cats or small children.  I want clear, concise, aesthetic layout, but I don't want wasted space.  I want a game I can <a href="http://www.mortijingle.com/jnmmnj/97/august/jnmwards.html" rel="nofollow">use against stab wounds</a> at the very least.  If it has its own carrying case, even better.  I want to get non-gamers cooing over it.  [Yeah, sure, I want them to think my sexual prowess is mighty merely because I own it, but if my shelves don't already give me geek stud cred, I'm probably out of luck.]  I want to be able to read it and reread it for pleasure.  I want it to have ideas of all sorts of strange and funny crossovers I can use it with, and I want it to come with support.  It shouldn't insult me, my gender, my (lack of) intelligence, or my personal choices, but it should allow me to challenge them.  I want it to have places I can take notes in the book.  Heck, I want a workbook.  I want things I can distribute to my players.  Most of all, I want the author(s) to be really, really enthusiastic about their product AND have them be talented enough to bring that same enthusiasm to me without it just shouting, "SQUEE!"<br><br>I'd also like a red wagon.  And a pony.<br><br>Thank you.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            In retrospect, there's at least one game for which I'd have paid $80: Final Fantasy X.  I played over 100 hours on it.  So have each of my older two boys.  Presentation, design, style, interesting and varied scenarios, dozens of customizable/tactical parts, monster collecting, item collecting, special hidden weapons, minigames, Blitzball!... I could go on and on.  It's like ten games in one.  And they are interrelated: you can gain special items in Blitzball to use in the main quest.  During your main quest explorations, you meet characters that you can recruit as Blitzball players.  It's <i>genius</i>.                        </div>

                            The point I was getting at with the D&amp;D books being used for things other than D&amp;D is to put to bed the supplement-treadmill canard. GURPS is built around a supplement treadmill, and many, many people buy GURPS supplements for use with other games. I've gotten use out of the DMG for worldbuilding elsewhere. I've used World of Darkness supplements to help out everything from Call of Cthulhu to Teenagers from Outer Space. So you can increase the amount that people are likely to pay for something by making it flexible or at least generalizable, something you can take from and use elsewhere. <br>

Put a more bullshit but still true way, coherent games have to be great in order to score a big chunk of change. Flexible games don't.                        </br></br></div>

I dunno how universally true this is. System-neutral/system-less products tend, IIRC, to sell pretty poorly. I don't think I would have bought <i>Ptolus</i> if it hadn't been designed for a game I know I play regularly. E.g., I don't see <a href="http://empcho.bizhosting.com/worldguide.html" rel="nofollow">The World Guide to Khaas</a> selling all that well.<br><br>I think it depends on the product. GURPS has a great reputation for quality sourcebooks, but given that I don't play GURPS, I can't see paying $80 for a single book, no matter how good.<br/><br/>Granted, I have taken advantage of the discounted prices Warehouse 23 is offering on GURPS 3e sourcebooks. I have the entire <i>Transhuman Space</i> line, and I probably paid $80 for the lot. Thing is, the "lot" is like 2000 pages of material.                        </br></br></div>

                            Once again, Jason, I'm not sure to which cannard you refer, but the only ideas that I know about with regard to the "supplement treadmill" actually are precisely the same as yours. Specifically that not all supplements are bad, and that GURPS is an exception, etc, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I'll bet that Spirit of the Century could have been broken up into four 100+ page books sold for $20 each, instead of one 400+ page book sold for $40. Same with Burning Empires. Not sure if that would really have increased the value, however...<br/>
