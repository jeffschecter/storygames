                    I was thinking about how I can better appreciate some games more than others, in that there is a certain class of games that I'm more likely to do well at, but even when I'm not going to win I'm enjoy myself more. In particular, very puzzle-like games (and puzzle-like parts of RPGs) are my bane! And I think it has to do with my ability to evaluate the value of a move I can make. So look:<br/>
<br/>
* *Puzzle Evaluation:* There are a very few moves where I score 100% value, and just maybe a very few moves that are nearly correct, scoring my 10% value. _Zendo. Some elements of Go. MIT-style Puzzle Hunts. D&amp;D-style puzzle rooms._<br/>
* *Random Evaluation:* There are moves that I can make that I can guess at the value of, but perhaps 50%-90% of the value of a move is randomly determined in any case. _Fluxx. Betrayal at House on the Hill._<br/>
* *Subjective Evaluation:* The value of a movie is determined by the players' own subjective rubrics; insofar as the game itself is concerned, most of the moves are valid ones. _Munchausen. Apples to Apples. A moment of personal (non-tactical) choice in a protagonist-centered RPG._<br/>
* *Marginal Evaluation:* The value of a move can be guessed at with a band of possibility. (For example: I know my two choices will net me value, whereas one seems to be 25-75% value, and the other is 40-60% value, but I know both moves are getting me closer to my own goals.) As a player, I know that a move will get me some more value, although it might be unclear how much value this will ultimately net me. _Catan. Checkers. Carcasonne. Some elements of Go._<br/>
<br/>
I'm really averse to games heavy on Puzzle evaluation, and lean towards Subjective and Random evaluation games, but also can tread some water in Marginal eval games. (And in a game like Go, I do okay in the part of the game that's about good positionining, the Marginal part, but in figuring out the shape of the board like one big Puzzle, I have more trouble.) This is both about the skills I have, as well as the enjoyment I get from the challenges in each. In fact, I'd guess my Marginal eval skills are actually pretty weak, but I still enjoy games with those elements, as at least I can see how it is I'm losing.<br/>
<br/>
I suggest this is a way to look at what the players of a game are capable of doing and what they enjoy, and you could look at the games you're running and figure out what kinds of evaluation a player needs to do.                </div>

                            I think it's interesting that I like some of these better outside RPGs than within. I enjoy puzzles outside of RPGs a lot; but I can move on if I don't get it. Inside an RPG, if a puzzle is put in place that has only one answer, it can stop the whole flow of the game. Also, one of the things I enjoy most about RPGs is the possibility of using creativity to solve problems. That's usually done with a subjective evaluation, though it's judged by the GM (or similar role).                        </div>
