The dice mechanic seems a bit unnecessarily complicated, especially when it comes to contests. I thought we'd gone beyond having to compare results on charts.</blockquote>\nThe charts are useful as an aide-memoire, can be incorporated into a character sheet design or gathered into a one-page summary sheet, and I've found quickly become not necessary as players tend to internalize the mechanics quickly. The charts are really not that onerous in my experience (played HQ1 and play-tested HQ2).\n<blockquote>The pdf is $20. They don't have a bundle.

I think the Evil Hat guys (free pdf with print purchase) and John Wick (Houses of the Blooded is a mere $5) need to school them on this one.</blockquote>\nI completely, totally, one-hundred percent agree. I don't think their pricing model is sensible, and I don't think their e-commerce model is sensible either. Word from the publisher is that they've made the decisions they've made because they wanted to return as much money to the creative talent as they could. That's as may be. But I can't help but feel that a bigger share of a smaller volume might be the problem they're going to face.<br/><br/>I would have thought that even a 15$ PDF would have been more palatable than 20$. If it were me (and it's not, and I'm not a business person), I would have thought you'd sell more with a 15$ PDF and a 35$ book+PDF bundle (and, indeed, you might see more book sales that way, especially if you also offered a 30$ book-only deal as they do now).<br/><br/>If it were me, I would have focussed on lining up one vendor that could handle PDF, book, and book+PDF sales and <i>then</i> worried about finding the best cut for my creative team... but, again, it's not me. And I'm rather glad to see HQv2 in actual print, because I do think, for some uses, it's a superior effort to HQv1, just as HQv1 was an improvement over HW.\n<blockquote>The company they have doing their electronic billing/distribution hasn't exactly worked out the distribution thing. I had to go to their support site and mess around for a few minutes until I stumbled on a download link. They haven't emailed it to me yet.</blockquote>\nYes, I also found that a bit concerning. I have no doubt but that people who spend their money will actually get their PDF. But I also have a gut feeling that part of the key to PDF sales is that they be as quick and painless as possible. I have a gut feeling that one's PDF sales would jump significantly if the purchaser got the PDF pretty much instantly. And, if it were me, I'd be looking for a "best fit vendor" that would afford the best customer service. Frankly, it astounds me that they would not have struck a deal with IPR: a company that's demonstrated (at least to me) that they know how to sell small-run games, and they can handle hard-copy product as well as PDFs, and they have great customer service, and an established reputation in the field.<br/><br/>On the hard-copy version of the game, I'm also a bit wary: the past two perfect bound books I've bought in the HQ line were expensive and the binding quality was sub-par, bordering on horrible. I'd really like a look at a hardcopy before buying it, or at least a thorough review from someone who cares as much about book quality as I do. But seeing this in my local FLGS is hardly likely to happen, so it may be a while before I actually buy a physical copy... 8P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215680/#Comment_215680" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-01T06:59:26+00:00" title="July  1, 2009  6:59AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I fucking LOVE HeroQuest.

My main point though is that we are not out of the norm. <br/>\nNOTE: We fully realise that Moon Design is not a major publisher like the ones used as examples above, but we are certainly trying to have the sensible business practices of one.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215891/#Comment_215891" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-01T19:48:21+00:00" title="July  1, 2009  7:48PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 1, 2009 7:49PM by Matt Snyder.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Rick. I mean this in good faith. But, pricing based on what the others are doing isn't terribly sensible just because it's some arbitrary standards. <br/><br/>Are those examples you quote competitors? Price accordingly. <br/><br/>Are your customers saying the price doesn't match their demand? Price accordingly. <br/><br/>In either case, it's not a clear business. It's tricky. <br/><br/>But, pricing because your industry pals do it that way seems to ignore the actual market itself. That seems like a terrible idea to me.<br/><br/>I bought your PDF. I'm not happy I still don't have anything to show for my digital PDF 12 hours later after giving you $20. Others are clearly not going to buy a game they probably would have if it were priced lower.<br/><br/>Consider this anecdotal demonstration from thsi thread: <br/><br/>Matt, Brennan and Aleksandr buy the PDF. You get $60 revenue. And, 3 potential evangelists who market for you.<br/><br/>Shreyas, Jeff, Victor, Zack, Bret, and Joel don't buy the PDF. These are unfulfilled demand.<br/><br/>Now, bring down that price point. Let's say $12. Matt, Brennan, Aleksandr, Shreyas, Jeff, Victor, Zack, Bret and Joel buy the PDF. You get $108 in revenue. And, you get 9 potential evangelists who market for you.<br/><br/>I don't know your margin. It's clearly lower in this case. I'll make a wild guess. Instead of making, oh, $13 per book you only make $5. <br/><br/>That's $39 profit in the first case. It's $45 in the second case (based on made up numbers, granted). <br/><br/>But, you have no inventory. It's digital. No cost of goods sold (server spaces, sure, and service costs). You make less money "per book," but the potential number of book copies is basically infinite.<br/><br/>To me, it's a no-brainer. Again, granted, I'm making up numbers. But, I think the numbers are worth a look beyond assuming that since others do it this way at 2/3rd pricing, you might as well too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215893/#Comment_215893" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-01T19:55:54+00:00" title="July  1, 2009  7:55PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah.

I'm still unclear on the ways it facilitates this, <i>better than HQ1 did.</i> What are the cool new features, tweaks, or refinements? Any dead weight dropped or elements streamlined for story-play? And again: the "choose target numbers for story rhythm" bit has already been standard practice for awhile among the Mike Holmes camp of HQ play.

I ordered and paid, waited the "2-6" hours for a response (7 hours, actually), then followed Brennen's lead in his first post and poked around on the website until I found my download.  <br/><br/>Thanks Brennen!  I wouldn't have though to even try that if you hadn't paved the way, and I would still be waiting for my email response.  I don't have any idea how much Moon Design is paying Plimus to deliver PDFs, but it had better be pretty close to zero dollars, since they are receiving pretty close to zero service.<br/><br/>The document itself is well produced and the layout is clean.  I've only noted two typos in the rules after a first read-through, and the art is nice.  About half of the pics seem to be Glorantha-related, the rest run the gamut of various genres.  The examples are pulled from a variety of genres as well.  Not thematic, in either case, but I personally like the effect.  The only thing that (slightly) bugs me is the use of the peculiar Gloranthan 'mastery rune' to mark Masteries.  Wouldn't a capital 'M' be more... universal?<br/><br/>The rules themselves appear to be HQ 1st Edition streamlined and 'unhooked' from Glorantha-specific concepts.  The new procedure for Extended Contests makes more sense to me than the old 'bidding'-based one did.  Overall, it really reads much more like a toolkit-style rulebook; most sections are structured as '<i>here's</i> the rule for doing <i>this</i>' followed by multiple examples of how to use that tool in games.<br/><br/>Count me as a satisfied customer of Moon Design, and a royally <i>dis</i>satisfied customer of Plimus.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215926/#Comment_215926" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-02T01:57:10+00:00" title="July  2, 2009  1:57AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 2, 2009 2:01AM by Graham.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Moon Design's pricing strategy looks fairly good to me. Release the PDF at $20. Those who want it at that price will buy it.<br/><br/>They can also reduce it to, say, $15 later, at which point the skinflints in this thread will cave and buy it. A further reduction to $12 later and others will buy it.<br/><br/>If they do this, they're rather cleverly selling it to different people at the different prices they want to pay.<br/><br/>And there will <i>always</i> be people who say it should be cheaper. Nobody ever says "You know, I think this PDF should be more expensive". The feedback always consists of people who think it should cost less, not more.

I mean this in good faith. But, pricing based on what the others are doing isn't terribly sensible just because it's some arbitrary standards.<br/><br/>But, pricing because your industry pals do it that way seems to ignore the actual market itself. That seems like a terrible idea to me.<br/><br/>I bought your PDF. I'm not happy I still don't have anything to show for my digital PDF 12 hours later after giving you $20. Others are clearly not going to buy a game they probably would have if it were priced lower.<br/><br/>Consider this anecdotal demonstration from thsi thread:<br/><br/>Matt, Brennan and Aleksandr buy the PDF. You get $60 revenue. And, 3 potential evangelists who market for you.<br/><br/>Shreyas, Jeff, Victor, Zack, Bret, and Joel don't buy the PDF. These are unfulfilled demand.<br/><br/>Now, bring down that price point. Let's say $12. Matt, Brennan, Aleksandr, Shreyas, Jeff, Victor, Zack, Bret and Joel buy the PDF. You get $108 in revenue. And, you get 9 potential evangelists who market for you.<br/></blockquote>\nHi Matt,<br/><br/>We are not happy with the download provider either, and getting that corrected is one of our top priorities. We certainly appreciate everyone's patience as we work through the delays. Fortunately, once we know of the delay we can resend the download link and that tends to fix the problem.<br/><br/>As for the pricing, I researched a number of pricing models from a variety of game companies. They aren't based on what any "pals" said.<br/><br/>Yes, I have no doubt that lowering the price would get more people to buy the book. I could make it $1 and I have no doubt that price would make more people happy that having the price at $2. The problem is finding out how much your sales go up as you lower the price.<br/><br/>Let's say 250 people buy the $20 PDF. That's $5000 gross revenue.<br/>Let's say I sold it for $12. That means to make the same money, we have to sell 417 copies of the PDF to come out ahead. (417 x $12 = $5004)<br/><br/>Thus, that 40% drop in price has to be offset by a fairly large increase in sales. Even then, some of you have said you still wouldn't buy it, and would only become likely buyers at $10, or 50% of the price. That would mean we would have to sell twice as many copies at $10 as we would have if the price were $20.<br/><br/>Yes, more people buying a game and recommending it is always a good thing, but it is not the only thing. We can't lose money in the process. We would have to go out of business.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215947/#Comment_215947" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-02T06:26:45+00:00" title="July  2, 2009  6:26AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Nobody ever says "You know, I think this PDF should be more expensive".</blockquote>\nActually, a lot of us here told Fred Hicks that Don't Rest Your Head should be priced higher when he first came out with it, and subsequently, he did raise the price.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215950/#Comment_215950" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-02T06:47:46+00:00" title="July  2, 2009  6:47AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For what it is worth, I think a high .pdf price has the additional opportunity cost of driving people to torrent sites.

I waited 14 hours...then simply e-mailed Moon Design and I was sent the download link in a few minutes.   So that definitely could be better.  I'm used to companies like rpgnow and indie-press revolution who have their shit together and know how to treat the customer.  I'm relatively unclear why Moon Design waited until the release of their biggest product to try out an online payment vendor for the first time.<br/><br/>As for the price, you get what you pay for.  I didn't have an issue with $20 for getting a game written by industry-great Robin Laws ostensibly perfecting a beloved game but I guess some people might.  In any case, I see plenty of $20 and over pdfs on other sites who are written by Johnny Q Nobody.  I'll admit it's *awful* that Moon Design isn't offering a bundle deal.  I won't be spending for a hardcopy because I don't like paying full price for the same content twice.<br/><br/>As to rules themselves, well... hmm.  I feel like the game is big time indulging in illusionism and doesn't want to admit it. I kind of hate the new "genre simulation" intent.  The narrator basically sets the resistance according to whether or not they want the players to succeed or fail.  WTF?!  Seriously?   I get the game turning its back on simulationism but they needed to find a better way of doing it. Also, "mock contests" are sanctioned Narrator cheating.  Literally, for mock conflicts the game recommends you cheat in whatever direction you want in order to establish a tone.  Whatever.<br/><br/>Augments are now rolled for or you can use the old, automatic method (though streamlined and only one augment value is allowed).  No more treating character sheets as "menus" to endlessly scan for augments.  Plus they have "Plot Augments" which is a nice feature.<br/><br/>The core method of conflicts using the success/failure charts is the same as HQ1.  Extended conflicts have been *greatly* streamlined; they're very easy to implement and are based on accruing 5 resolution points.  I liked bidding from HQ 1 but I agree it got too mathy and that part of it felt like a different animal than the rest of the game.<br/><br/>I love Lingering Benefits (which is winners of contests recving' positive modifiers until the next conflict with that trait that they fail.  Group simple contests use resolution points and are very cool and yet another interpretation about doing bigger conflicts where each character can have a contest to shine.  Wonderful.<br/><br/>"Rising Action" scenes and "Climatic Scene" scenes have different consequence tables which is very nice.  (you can make a climatic scene like the finale of Hamlet happen because in HQ2 even the victor might drop dead at the end of the final contest using the climatic scene consequence table)<br/><br/>Throughout there is a *ton* of advice on explaining the game, the logic behind the approach and how to tailor it various genres.  Also, much more guidance on modifiers, etc.  I was pretty disappointed that they didn't describe magic in a generic fashion (I guess they're waiting for the genre book to do that) but instead included a chapter on the glorantha setting and described magic there.<br/><br/>Overall, HQ2 streamlines the HQ engine and codifies many house-rules.  It's not without its imperfections but it's a very nice upgrade of the Heroquest engine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE

In his view the GM better enforce success or failure to create a compelling story.<br/><br/>In my view, random dice rolls will over the long haul shift the fortunes of the PCs in entertaining ways just fine.  And trusting the dice have the added benefit of allowing everyone at the table to be surprised by new twists and turns as they arise.  Laws' is still trying to make sure a GM is the "writer" of a story -- which I'm not interested in.  I get the feeling you're not either.  But he seems pretty attached to it right now.<br/><br/>When you write about this matter, "But they needed to find a better way of doing it," what are the options?  How are you, as a GM (assuming you are going to use it) going to get around this?  I haven't read it yet, and don't know how much of the gameplay is sewn into this point of view.  <br/><br/>I really love what you wrote about the rest of the changes.  But this notion that the difficulties are determined by the result the GM wants is a game-killer for me. <br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216155/#Comment_216155" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-03T02:56:53+00:00" title="July  3, 2009  2:56AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Given that it's GM-centric, to what extent can it be drifted so it's <i>not</i> GM-centric?

This seems to have gone further down that path.<br/><br/>It's odd, it's mechanically a story game in many respects, but at the same time it's much more about GM fiat and GM authority than the majority of traditional rpgs are, most trad rpgs are nothing like that overt in putting the GM forward as sole authority and arbiter of game content.  <br/><br/>The example of play features a mock contest in which the GM decides the outcome but pretends to the player it's a real contest, the example of play.<br/><br/>Mechanically I'm interested, but the GM's way or the highway approach is I think very mid '90s.<br/><br/>Difficulties determined by the GM to serve the needs of his story is basically about massively empowering the GM to ensure the story proceeds in accordance with his vision, which as an old school trad gaming grognard I find very alien.  If I were a story gamer, I think I'd find it even more so.

Even so, many games often have methods to allow other players at the table to facilitate one outcome or another, like Shock:.<br/><br/>There's a fundamental game design difficulty here: in a game with task resolution, how do you define the difficulty without someone specifying it? The traditional method is by a series of charts describing every action possible within the game, but this is clearly inadequate for a story-centric game as it limits the characters' possible actions. If you do have a single person specifying the difficulty, and you want to play a story-centric game, why should the difficulty be defined according to laws of realism (the correctness which everyone can agree upon, to some extent) rather than narrative logic (which is extremely subjective at worst, and a fantastic shared experience at best)?<br/><br/>Does HQ2 offer an innovative solution to this design challenge? It doesn't seem like it. Does that mean it's broken?

The Player can either increase the odds or not, according to his own desires.  It's a gambling decision.  The Player gets to decide when he's willing to risk greater consequences or not.  And even then the outcome is not pre-determined.  <br/><br/>In <i>SotC</i> the GM isn't saying the Player's Character will succeed or fail, but only to reduce odds for appropriately interesting moments based on the Player's choice of behaviors for the Character (and certainly it has nothing to do with the rhythm of the story the GM has mapped out in his head.)<br/><br/>In <i>Sorcerer</i> the GM's assigning of Bonus Dice or Penalty Dice have nothing to do controlling the pacing of the narrative, nor determining success or failure.  They are given for the same reasons that Fan Mail is given in <i>Primetime Adventures</i> -- the narration is fun and pleasing.  It's the GM's way of saying, "Thanks."  And since success or failure is always possible with a die roll, Bonus Dice can change the odds of a role but never determine outcome.<br/><br/><br/>As far as I can tell there are examples of "mock contests" in the HQ2 books and the rules seem to encourage the GM deciding the results of the conflicts before the dice are rolled.  None of the games above can do that.<br/><br/>What I'd like to know is if the game works if you choose not to play that way.  Is there a actually a mechanic in there that provides a tense contest when the PCs engage in a conflict?  There might well be.  I don't know.  Since the notion that the GM has some idea how things will turn out ahead of time defeats <i>my particular fun</i> from RPGs this is something I'm really curious about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216198/#Comment_216198" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-03T08:27:48+00:00" title="July  3, 2009  8:27AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>Since the notion that the GM has some idea how things will turn out ahead of time defeats<i>my particular fun</i>from RPGs this is something I'm really curious about.</blockquote>\nMy preferred style of gaming and Christopher's are I think pretty different, but the above holds absolutely true for me too.

The examples include at least one utterly meaningless roll, which I find baffling. And, another bit from the text actually says the Narrator should decide things, in part, based on"how long it has been since Joey last scored a thrilling victory."<br/><br/>Bleah. It's as though there's a great nod toward story games, toward narrativism. But, in fact it's just a nod, and the thing appears to be GM-as-mastermind story creation with players blissfully along for the ride to "be cool."<br/><br/>Also, the "any genre" thing is a red herring. It's not that you can do <i>any story</i> ever, regardless of genre. It's that you can do <i>a particular kind of story</i> in any genre.

I was under the impression, having not read the rules yet myself, that the concern was strictly surrounding the GM assigning arbitrary difficulties to tasks based on story-appropriateness, rather than realism, fairness, or some other factor games commonly use for this purpose.<br/><br/>I suppose it comes down to the exact technique advocated in the text: if it is "if the player is taking the story in an inappropriate direction, then secretly set the difficulty level to 99 and announce they fail" or "if the player is taking the story in an inappropriate direction, then announce a difficulty level of 25 (assuming that's high) - if the player still succeeds, then reward them with a major plot twist". The first approach is unadulterated Illusionism, while the second is simply a GM-moderated story... maybe not everyone's cup of tea, but I personally do not see a distinction between "you can't do that because I deem it implausible" and "you can't do that because it's not appropriate to the story" (or better, switched around: "you can do that because it's within your character's capabilities" versus "you can do that because it makes perfect thematic sense").<br/><br/>Whether DRYH, SotC and Sorcerer use their GM-assigned difficulty levels for story pacing or for some other effect I think is also a matter of technique. The games themselves do not provide much of a guidance in how or why these should be set, and I have personally seen SotC's GM-assigned difficulties being used to generate both great fun and great annoyance by different GMs using different techniques. My gut instinct tell me that assigning DRYH Pain, SotC difficulty or Sorcerer bonus dice based on story appropriateness could provide for a tremendous amount of good fun, with players vying for bonuses through positioning themselves such that the thematic impact of their actions gel with that of the GM's and/or the rest of the group's. It also tells me that arbitrary (extreme and/or secretive) assignments based on fulfilling a pre-plotted story line would also be entirely possible and terribly un-fun. It's in the technique, not the mechanic itself - so once again, if the game text does state a technique which results in Illusionism, then I absolutely stand corrected.<br/><br/>Edit to add: by "reward them with a major plot twist", I mean "reward them with a major plot twist which you hadn't planned for, in accordance with the action they just took". This way, as in DRYH, you can nudge the story in a certain direction by affecting the player's chances of succeeding, but you cannot control it completely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216210/#Comment_216210" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-03T09:15:37+00:00" title="July  3, 2009  9:15AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Based on what I've seen on Laws's blog, I had assumed HQ would offer a method for assigning difficulty levels based on a structural view of dramatic tension and characters' position in the overall story (i.e., rising tension, falling tension, climax, etc.).

Here's why:<br/>\n<br/>\nHeroquest 1 presented a well-liked, quite coherent core mechanic for solving any conflicts with any abilities and without scale boundaries. However, it didn't define nearly as coherently how this system should be used: what should be modeled, where the focus should be, how resistances should be set etc. This allowed the ruleset to be drifted to both Story Now and The Right to Dream play but also resulted in a lot of confusion and incoherence. Mostly, the ruleset itself actually proposed a world(Glorantha)-simulating approach with mastery scales set for various Gloranthan entity types, complex rules for different kinds of magic and heroquesting, and so on. Yet mostly these weren't bad for Story Now play either, because Gloranthan reality itself focuses much on communities, passions, magical imperatives and their conflicts - prime material for premise-building.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow finally on to Heroquest 2. The core mechanic is completely the same, although it too has been honed to perfection (augmentation is better, extended contests are better). But what is more important is that now the text is actually a very coherent guidebook on how to apply that core mechanic from a particular perspective. And that perspective is now the <b>simulation of dramatic story</b>.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe pass/fail cycle is at its center, and it's a great design. It's really simple: for each success it ramps up the resistance of the next conflict and vice versa, leaving the GM to explain this by introducing enough circumstances in scene framing to make it believable.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what it actually on a deeper level is is a feedback system operating within the game, dynamically guiding (but not forcing, thus maintaining suspense and the feeling of surprise) the game to follow the dramatic structure of good stories. It doesn't stop there. There are now possibilities to tweak the resolution system to suit particular dramatic situations (pyrrhic victories ala 300, different consequence tables for rising action/climactic scenes, ...) as well as optional actions in contests that allow particular story-relevant actions like risky gambits in desperate situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's not illusionist either. Nowhere in the text does it say that the GM can fudge results any which way. All resistances are decided before the roll of the die and even the quoted and much maligned mock contest rule only goes one way, being actually a refinement of "Say yes or roll the dice" into "Say yes or roll the dice or secretly say yes and roll the dice for suspense".<br/>\n<br/>\nSo HQ2 is to my mind the first really coherent story simulation game. Now, what this means to creative agendas is actually not so simple and quite interesting. Certainly it means that this is very much your game if your Right to Dream is about celebrating dramatic stories. It also means that HQ1 was probably a better choice if your Right to Dream was about world simulation.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Story Now, the situation is much more complex. Being generic, there is no longer by default the rich foundation of Glorantha to create premise, yet there are still rules for communities (and better ones than HQ1 at that), and now all your abilities are those that make you a unique and interesting protagonist, as it is stated that all those boring common abilities are subsumed by your occupation keywords and such.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom a rules perspective, the text itself doesn't really give you direct guidance on setting up or resolving situations interesting in the Story Now sense. But if you already know how to do so, the rest of guidance on applying the system is so congruent with how Story Now stories usually play out that it'll probably support it very well (but maybe not as good as HQ1 did when you created your guidance if you have acute Story Now instincts).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper" title="Ian Cooper"><img alt="Ian Cooper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/733/nRK18K7505XHK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper">Ian Cooper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216349/#Comment_216349" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-04T08:31:50+00:00" title="July  4, 2009  8:31AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Denys</cite><br>As to rules themselves, well... hmm.  I feel like the game is big time indulging in illusionism and doesn't want to admit it. I kind of hate the new "genre simulation" intent.  The narrator basically sets the resistance according to whether or not they want the players to succeed or fail.  WTF?!  Seriously?   I get the game turning its back on simulationism but they needed to find a better way of doing it. Also, "mock contests" are sanctioned Narrator cheating.  Literally, for mock conflicts the game recommends you cheat in whatever direction you want in order to establish a tone.  Whatever.<br/></br></blockquote>\n<br>You might want to re-read this section. The resistance is set according to the needs of the story: should this be a tough challenge or something the heroes brush past. The pass-fail cycle is a tool to help you figure out what 'dramatic logic' suggests might be the next resistance. Heroes having a tough time, give them a break with an easy resistance, heroes feeling unchallenged, then give them a harder resistance. But it is explicitly a tool to recommend not an admonition. Some folks will like the idea of a helping hand when setting a resistance some won't.<br><br>Part of the deal here is that HQ1 set resistances based on arbitrary world scales. All thanes are 10W in combat, all horses run at 2W. By implication any contest used the absolute values. Up against a lion in the arena, let me consult where the lion is on a scale. HQ2 shifts to use resistances such as Low, Moderate, and Hard which then translate into a number. The pass-fail cycle is one way to figure out what that number might be. Had a lot of failures, then it might suggest a Low resistance, had a lot of successes, then it might suggest  a Hard resistance. But it is explicitly a tool. If you are happier setting the resistance based off of your instinct, or some pre-prepared material then that is cool too.<br><br>HQ2 is explicitly trying to help people whose notes for the session are a couple of scribbled lines on  piece of paper about what might happen to any of the players and who thus tend to make up encounters and resistances on the spot. HeroQuest is intended for people who trust each other, and are co-operating towards having a good time. It is not really intended for folks who want to challenge each other with obstacles. Someone pointed out that HQ is not a resource management game, where you manage hit points, spells etc. to overcome examples but one of co-operative storytelling were rolls provide uncertainty to take the narrative in different directions.<br><br>The point for the narrator is that success or failure should both be equally interesting outcomes for the player. At this point any notion of cheating by setting resistances on the fly disappears from the agenda because the point is not to win, but to weave an interesting co-operative story. So there is nothing to cheat at.<br><br>Personally I've never responded well to GMs who don't pave the resistances to the players but stick to arbitrary values in a rule book. I really don't consider that cheating.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper" title="Ian Cooper"><img alt="Ian Cooper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/733/nRK18K7505XHK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper">Ian Cooper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216353/#Comment_216353" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-04T08:58:15+00:00" title="July  4, 2009  8:58AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here is my summary for HQ 1 owners.\n<ul>\n<li>It's generic. Glorantha is confined to an appendix as a sample setting. You don't have to extract the rules for other settings</li>\n<li>There is advice on creating other settings for HeroQuest, particularly on how to model magic, technology, and superpowers</li>\n<li>Extended contests have been simplified. They are faster in play and map better to simple contests. In effect each round is a simple contest that allows you to score resolution points toward victory instead of deciding the contest. First to five wins. In fact the other night we appreciated that a simple contest can become extended by treating the simple contest as the first round of an extended contest when you make the wrong call</li>\n<li>Group simple contests make a mass effort by the players much easier. Previously we modeled this as one 'lead' who everyone augmented. Now everyone rolls for their side, totals their resolution points and the side with the highest total wins</li>\n<li>Consequences are different for rising and climatic action allowing winners to be suffer adverse consequences at the moment of victory in the climax. A big complaint on HQ1 was that it was binary win or lose</li>\n<li>One augment only. Under HQ1 augment hunting had become the 'game within a game' as folks scoured their sheet looking for bonuses. From something that was supposed to reflect 'he killed my brother, now I strike him down in revenge' for a lot of groups augments became 'I'll get back to you when you finish totaling the numbers on the sheet'.  So the change here is explicitly to require augments to enhance the game for everyone around the table not just be invisio-advantages for munchkins. To compensate the numbers are much bigger. +6 or +9 is common for an augment now.</li>\n<li>No special rules. Remember how in HQ1 you had bonuses for equipment, positioning etc. No more. It's either an ability like Knightly Armor 10W or it has no mechanical effect. The only real modifier now is a Stretch, when you really bend what an ability could before and a specific ability bonus to script protect narrower abilities in comparison to broader ones.</li>\n<li>Clearer explanations. Remember that because of Glorantha, HQ2 will sell to people who have no other exposure to story games.</li>\n<li>Better explanation of keywords and variations like umbrella and package. For example, you can use a keyword like Thief directly.This reduces the need for so many abilities on the sheet. We just assume you can do anything a thief would be able to do. Genre packs are the key to understanding a keyword in a setting. </li>\n</ul>\nFrom an actual play perspective we have been using this version for over a year now as play-testers and it is far more streamlined and easy to use than HQ1 in play.

I didn't aim that comment at you, it was a general point about this kind of game. Apologies if you thought it was directed at you.<br/><br/>HQ has some advice about handling contests where failure is not interesting and would just create a whiff factor. The classic example is the locked door. If interesting adventure lies beyond, why make folks roll to get past it. <br/><br/>HQ1 had this problem in Glorantha with heroquests. To go on a heroquest required you to overcome a 10W3 obstacle. If you failed no adventure. So HQ2 addresses this issue with a number of options. All of them are just variations on saying yes you succeed to the player when they describe an action. This is not to do with illusionism, but choosing whether to ask for a roll to achieve an action.<br/><br/>"Automatic successes are appropriate when failure would seem peculiar or out of character, and in cases where the Narrator can\u2019t envision an interesting or entertaining plot branch arising from failure." and a slight variation "Use an arduous automatic success when your primary concern is pacing. Simply allow the characters to succeed without a contest, and then describe in sweat-inducing detail their hard-won victory. ... preserving suspension of disbelief."<br/><br/>In some cases the heroes still roll, whilst they will always succeed at their goal, failure in the contest has impact somewhere else<br/><br/>"Use a costly success where failure offers no entertaining plot branches, but when you still want the group to work for victory,... Even if the players suffer a defeat, they still achieve the prize around which the contest is framed. They also, however, suffer a state of adversity to one or more abilities, in keeping with the defeat level, as per the Consequences of Defeat Table."<br/><br/>In other words this is just advice that a defeat might not directly prevent you gaining your objective, just penalize you elsewhere.<br/><br/>Mock contests are just similar to automatic successes but have a slight chance of a failure, hence the roll.<br/><br/>But the objective to all of these it to solve a similar problem. The narrative proposes an obstacle, but we do not consider it an obstacle in story terms. How do we deal with the journey across the mighty desert if its what happens at the Oasis that we all care about. This is just a range of tools for that. It's either don't have a contest, or make the contest about something else. So this is something a little more sophisticated than heavy handed illusionism.<br/><br/>For all that we have never used a mock contest in play (hell its an optional box out, not even in the main narrative on contests). I use automatic success and costly success all the time.<br/><br/>I think people are making something from nothing here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper" title="Ian Cooper"><img alt="Ian Cooper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/733/nRK18K7505XHK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper">Ian Cooper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216367/#Comment_216367" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-04T10:14:52+00:00" title="July  4, 2009 10:14AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Bleah.

Had it easy so far, then make resistances harder, had it tough make it easier. But it is just a tool. In HQ1 a thane might always be SwordFighting 10W. in HQ2 he is Hard or Very Hard (the number is figured from a lookup) or just set from the pass/fail cycle.

That's all right, but trust really isn't the issue here.<br/><br/>In setting resistances in any game of HQ I've ever run, I make decisions based on my assessment of the situation. I don't personally see anything wrong with having a rough benchmark in mind (e.g. warriors mostly around 10W to 10W2), but I can set the numbers high if this warrior is badass and so on. The resolution system takes care of the rest \u2013 anybody who's played HQ should know that failure is only as much of a problem as you let it be. Automatic successes are already in the rules. <br/><br/>Yes, I know it's just a tool, but it doesn't seem like a very good one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216423/#Comment_216423" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-04T16:14:37+00:00" title="July  4, 2009  4:14PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This whole <i>thread</i> is too fast for me, by like a factor of 5 (most internet threads are only too fast by a factor of 2 or 3).<br/><br/>Anyway, other folks have already said mostly what I would have. Particularly Christopher, Max and Chris Chinn's blog post. Let me just sum up what I'm hearing that I like, and that I don't like:<br/><br/>Like:\n<ul>\n<li>Streamlined extended contests. I thought the bidding was rather cool, but I can accept that this method is cleaner and slicker.</li>\n<li>Rules divorced from setting. While it's not a huge deal to do this yourself, it's easier and less homework-y if you don't have to. And if there's advice for making your own spellcasting or cybernetics or what have you systems, then awesome!</li>\n<li>Paring down the abilities to what really matters. Sounds rad. I love that everything on an HQ sheet is descriptive of your character as a person, but you DID get a LOT of Abilities littering your sheet in HQ 1.</li>\n<li>Special consequences for climaxes. It sounds awesome to be able to achieve a range of nuanced results in resolution, and where more than a climactic confrontation? On that note, Arduous Automatic Success and Costly Success are HOT HOT HOT.</li>\n</ul>\nDon't like:\n<ul>\n<li>Not sure how I feel about this "one augment only" thing. On one hand I see the value of limiting augments to the ability that <i>really</i> matters, instead of making it a bonus-hunt. On the other hand I always liked that you could pull every relevant aspect of your character into a conflict, not just "fighting skill" or whatever. In my play I always found the augment-hunting wasn't really a problem; people generally limited themselves to whatever came quickly to mind in the heat of the moment, and it was all relevant and cool. It was, however, sometimes difficult to narrate in more than a couple. I kind of favor a balance, like a 2 or 3 augment max, but 1 sounds over-constraining. (Of course if they've trimmed Abilities down to the essentials, that could help this issue.)</li>\n<li>All this stuff about jimmying rolls. yes, I understand that it's about setting difficulties, not outcomes. But guess what. . .? <i>Setting difficulties is exactly how gamemasters jimmy outcomes</i>. In the typical illusionist setup, the GM has two options: keep the target <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23s&amp;Mode=like">#s</a> hidden and fudge results as desired, or keep the numbers open, and set them based on your own desires. The latter method has greater appearance of honesty, but it carries a risk, that you won't <i>always</i> get your way unless you set the difficulty at impossible. But in this mode of GMing that's an acceptable risk, and the fact is you're still deciding how <i>in general</i> the results will fall. Can we ignore that? Sure, I guess. but that's no argument for it being in there, and incredibly misleading to anyone approaching this game for "story creation" if they then learn that "story creation" means "GM controls the arc of the action." Oh, and the "mock contests" only being for illusory <i>success</i> is still ass--it's condescending to the poor poor philistine players who just can't let go of their "roll-playing" delusions.</li>\n</ul>\nAnd I guess that's it. there's far more that I like than dislike, but the dislikes are bigger deals individually. As Ian suggests, the difficulty=setting issue can be tweaked easily enough and augments can too I guess. Sounds like a net gain for veteran players, but I worry about new folks coming in and reading this "Story Structure" stuff and getting funny ideas.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel<br/><br/>PS Hi, Max! Always nice to see you around. It's funny how we could both object so strongly to the same thing from two different directions, eh?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper" title="Ian Cooper"><img alt="Ian Cooper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/733/nRK18K7505XHK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper">Ian Cooper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216468/#Comment_216468" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-05T03:27:44+00:00" title="July  5, 2009  3:27AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>Hi Ian,<br/><br/>You're moving fast on these, so I want to let you know I want to give a longer reply, but today isn't the day.

I wanted to step in because many of the reviews I have seen so far don't bear much relation to the text of the game or the game in play. Certainly the accusations of illusionism bear no relation to illusionism as I understood from when we were at the forge (which for me has everything to do with convincing the players that their choices affect the outcome of the story when they don't and not the mechanical notion of how to set the level of a resistance). Robin does not recommend anything close to illusionism anywhere in the text. Indeed my understanding of the tool is antithetical to illusionism<br/><br/>Overall I am surprised by the response of Story Games, so many people attacking a game they have not read, based off mis-information in reviews. I thought the people I knew on this forum were more reasoned than that. But this meme, that HQ2 encourages illusionism, seems to have been taken as fact, by so many people, that I felt the need to step in.<br/><br/>I'm not saying HQ2 is perfect anymore that IAWA, MLWM, Sorcerer, DiTV, PTA, The Pool, HotB, BW etc. have ever proved perfect. But people are making a lot of assertions from hearsay that just aren't there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper" title="Ian Cooper"><img alt="Ian Cooper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/733/nRK18K7505XHK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper">Ian Cooper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216469/#Comment_216469" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-05T04:02:22+00:00" title="July  5, 2009  4:02AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's talk about how the pass/fail cycle works in actual play (I can't talk about mock contests, we have never needed them as a tool).<br/><br/>Last week's HQ2 game is typical for us. <br/><br/>We were playing in Dragon Pass  in Glorantha. I have a lot of setting notes based around an Orlanthi clan in Sartar (<a href="http://iancooper.brinkster.net/glorantha/sartar/redcow/redcow.html" rel="nofollow">this setting 20 years later</a>). The Lunar Empire has recently been pushed out of the clan's land and they now lie on the border with those clans still under the Empire. Many of the clan converted to the worship of the Lunar gods during the Occupation, and the clan is uncertain of its direction, support the rebellion against the Empire or not.<br/><br/>I have a lot of setting notes but unlike the notes above I don't have fixed numbers for all the narrator characters instead I have notes on significant abilities or extraordinary abilities which equate to Hard or Very Hard resistances, the things these guys are known for.<br/><br/>Preparation for a typical session for me is to put together some bangs based off what happened last week and the 'flags' on the players sheets. As an example, two of the players are brother and sister-in-law. The brother is an Orlanthi traditionalist and the sister-in-law a Lunar married to his Lunar convert brother (a narrator character). So they are on opposed sides of the conflict. In a previous week the sister-in-law had killed a young man on a cattle raid. <br/><br/>Much of the play was taken from one bang that the chieftain of the clan wanted the brother to reach a settlement with the neighboring clan over the killing. My notes were little more than that.<br/><br/>From that point on the players explored the outcomes of that request. <br/><br/>As contests occurred I made a note of the contest outcome (marginal victory, minor defeat). When the player tried to take an action that I did not believe should automatically succeed (just say yes or roll the dice in action here) I used 3 things to figure the resistance: notes about the narrator character if any as to whether they had significant abilities to bring to play, then my instinct for how hard this should be, finally the suggested next resistance from the pass/fail cycle. (This is explicitly how HQ2 suggests you handle it btw). A lot of the time pass/fail does not come up, but sometimes it does.<br/><br/>Putting numbers against anything other than setting elements would tend to mean that I had a pre-prepared plan for what should happen, which would encourage railroading or illusionism. So I always need to create some numbers on the fly.<br/><br/>So the above situation panned out to the two brothers and their sister heading north to try and reach a settlement. The sister-in-law wanted to arrive during the funeral, and then narrated walking down among the grieving relatives, smearing herself in mud and ochre and joining the grieving mass at the funeral pyre. When I needed a roll to decide how the mob would react I had to come up with a number. There were no named narrator characters to draw from, my gut told me that this was pretty tough Hard or Very Hard, in all likelihood despite cultural taboos around hospitality she would be lynched and the pass/fail cycle suggested that this was a Moderate resistance. In the end I opted for Hard. The player scored a Major Victory and ended up in a weeping embrace with her victim's mother.<br/><br/>So there is nothing more here than a way to set a difficulty rating on the fly as you do in say Burning Wheel. Robin is just suggesting you take into account another factor, the dramatic logic of the story. There is nothing less arbitrary around that as a factor over my perception of how hard something should be in the real world. <br/><br/>And of course you never need to go to that third step if you don't want to, just stop at the first one, or two. It's explicitly advice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216471/#Comment_216471" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-05T05:20:49+00:00" title="July  5, 2009  5:20AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 5, 2009 5:21AM by Andy.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the info, Ian!<br/><br/>As for me, the PDF is <i>retarded-expensive</i>, but the print version isn't that much more, so I'll eventually pick up the print version once I get through with some other games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus" title="nikodemus"><img alt="nikodemus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus">nikodemus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216476/#Comment_216476" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-05T06:48:05+00:00" title="July  5, 2009  6:48AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 5, 2009 6:51AM by nikodemus.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>But people are making a lot of assertions from hearsay that just aren't there.</blockquote>\nHear, hear!<br/><br/>As for the mock contests, to me at least they are functionally equivalent to telling player that they succeed as long as their roll isn't a fumble. A Really Simple Contest, if you like. I've been using contests like this occasionally when running games using HQ1. In mock contests as described you also roll a second die secretly and ignore it -- I've never done that, and don't quite see the point.<br/><br/>Anyways, having just finished reading the book, here are some impressions:<br/><br/><b>Style of Writing</b><br/><br/>Me like. Descriptive, not prescriptive.<br/><br/><b>Scale</b><br/><br/>I really like the way the scale has been sorted out using PC ability scores as the benchmark, and how ability are _not_ absolute measurements.<br/><br/>However, there are three places I can see that deal with contests between apparently similar but fundamentally disparate abilities:\n<ol>\n<li>An example about how a cowboy with "Run Fast 18w" cannot run faster than a horse with "Run Fast 8w" (assuming normal western genre conventions.) This is good and clear.</li>\n<li>A sidebar about contests between ordinary and extraordinary abilities explains how ordinary "Strength 18w" might win superpowered "Strength 18w" at armwrestling. Depending on how you envision superstrength this is either just right or very weird -- but not really obvious. Moreover, this bit also talks about (optionally) capping ordinary abilities at eg. 18w to ensure that extraordinary ones trump them in the long run: the overall effect this has is not clear to me, and this seems like a workaround to mitigate the effects of accidentally thinking of ability scores as absolute measurements.</li>\n<li>A section called "Abilities vs. Absolute Values" in the Creatures section has a third take on this, and seems like the most complete one of the bunch. The suggestion here is to specify a absolute values such as top running speed "Relevant Statistics" when necessary as a tool to ensure narrative consistency. This is good and sensible.</li>\n</ol>\nWhat is lacking, however, are guidelines and examples on framing contests between such disparate abilities. I think I see how this is supposed to work, but...<br/><br/><b>Communities</b><br/><br/>I mostly like this, but I have a feeling that I would prefer to abstract "resources" out of communities. Resources are almost like abilities, but not quite. Those familiar with Stolze's Reign will want think about how HQ communities differ from Reign companies.<br/><br/><b>Glorantha</b><br/><br/>Restricted to a few scattered examples plus a single chapter. The chapter serves as a nice example of a magic system framework. Aside from that and saying "Thank you for not forcing me to read around<br/>this!", I don't really feel qualified to comment on it.<br/><br/><b>Examples</b><br/><br/>There are a lot of these, which is good. One thing is missing however: example dialogue between GM and players framing contests. There is a great leeway in how much emphasis is put on the framing, how explicit it is made, how clearly different outcomes are defined up front, etc. I strongly believe this is a case of different strokes for different folks, but sampling the scale a bit would have been nice. (Should you believe that there is a right way and a wrong way to frame contests, then the need for written out GM/player dialogue illustrating the difference between the two seems all the more urgent.)<br/><br/><b>Editing Issues</b><br/><br/>There are several places where I get the feeling that one more editing pass would have done good: references to concepts explained later in the book, multiple examples drawn from the same source which read better if you read the later ones first, etc. Nothing earth shattering, just a low-grade annoyance. Still way easier to read than the earlier incarnations of HQ.<br/><br/><b>PDF Issues</b><br/><br/>No links: neither the table of contents, inline page references, nor the index are clickable. Low-rez art: pixellated art looks silly.<br/><br/>Full score and kudos for not locking the PDF down, though!<br/><br/><b>Art</b><br/><br/>Varies wildly in quality and style. Style variations seem appropriate given the genericity of presentation, but the context is sometimes odd: a manga flavored image smack in the middle of the Glorantha section?! Nice picture but questionable placement. I think the book would have been improved by dropping some of the dodgier images, but then I think 90% of RPG books have way too much pointless art. YMMV.<br/><br/><b>Summa Summarum</b><br/><br/>Overall, I like it. It will definitely have an effect on the way I run HQ, and it will probably make me use HQ for more games. Price on the PDF was a bit steep, yes -- had it been less so I would probably have picked up a print copy as well, but $50 for both?

Look for opportunities to solicit their input<i>. Leave gaps in the storyline that allow the PCs to pursue their own agendas.</i></blockquote>\nWhile HQ2 is certainly a big step away from where HQ1 put the game compared to Hero Wars, it depends on the group knowing which way to drift, and it goes easy into Nar, Sim, or Illusionist play. (Which also means expect to see a lot more "how to play it" bickering) <br/><br/>I think the tools are really powerful for ANY of those modes, which means if you're looking to play, you'll need to be really clear as a group which way you're going - signing up at a con or jumping into a group might earn you a surprise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper" title="Ian Cooper"><img alt="Ian Cooper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/733/nRK18K7505XHK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper">Ian Cooper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216491/#Comment_216491" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-05T09:45:06+00:00" title="July  5, 2009  9:45AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bankuei</cite>After a full reading, I saw that HQ2 can be easily drifted either towards or away from Illusionism.

Thanks for that clarity. <br/><br/>I think it is understandable given the existing audience that Moon Designs were likely to want to avoid alienating too many of their existing purchasers who do prefer Illusionist or Sim play and so any Nar message is likely to be watered down to make it more palatable. A lot of the audience is not core Story Games readership. To be fair I doubt that Moon Designs, or Robin, thought precisely in those terms though but looked to support a broad range of players. <br/><br/>That said the Sim camp seem to believe that this rules set moves further away from the their goals. Look for a lot of talk about HQ1.5 from this group as an indicator of where they sit. They liked the support for Sim drift in HQ1 over HW and so don't want to move as far away as HQ2 does. I think Sim is the big loser with this version as their goals are much more marginalized.<br/><br/>It is fair to say that Illusionism remains a popular style among many HQ players and a lot of published scenario material for Glorantha has been Illusionist in style. Still I'm beginning to see a lot less drift in that direction over time. I expect you will see a mix of styles in publications.<br/><br/>But I would agree with advice that understanding the social contract in a HQ group is important as there are differences in how to play between different groups.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/smathis" title="smathis"><img alt="smathis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/smathis">smathis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216514/#Comment_216514" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-05T12:54:27+00:00" title="July  5, 2009 12:54PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            MDP does all this research on PDF vs. Print pricing and fails to do adequate research on an online retailer?

I played in a few games of HQ1 where the GM set resistances on the fly based on kind of how he thought things should go.

Please forgive my disappointment.<br/><br/>There are things I like about what I've read from HQ2 and I'll likely get the PDF once I can feel assured that the online retailer is reputable. Right now, I shudder to think what the current retailer is doing with credit card info considering how poorly they're botching fulfillment.<br/><br/>May I suggest uploading the PDF to Lulu? Lulu's not perfect. But people can be paying for and downloading HQ2 within a matter of minutes. And it's possible to sell through Lulu as download only.<br/><br/>It's not like you're selling a bundle or anything and need the current online retailers to handle both. If you do, why not IPR?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JeffRichard" title="JeffRichard"><img alt="JeffRichard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JeffRichard">JeffRichard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216517/#Comment_216517" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-05T13:24:59+00:00" title="July  5, 2009  1:24PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are no problems with PDF fulfillment.

Contrariwise, the advice is to respect the continuity: if something was earlier established to be hard, it should remain hard -- or if it becomes easier there should be a reason for it (eg. the guard is obviously hung over.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216525/#Comment_216525" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-05T14:02:10+00:00" title="July  5, 2009  2:02PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, I think it's Robin Laws' misfortune to have invented a core system so powerful and flexible that very little more needs to be said. Everything else is special case rules and advice, some of which are rather better than others.<br/><br/>I have so far acquired Hero Wars in 2000 and HeroQuest in 2003. Both of those had problematic aspects and some truly dodgy advice. Those of us that have played the game have worked out (have had to work out) many of these issues to our own satisfaction. We already know how to use it.<br/><br/>If I wanted to, I could implement my own version of the pass/fail cycle just from reading about it. In fact, I'm pretty sure that I would have already implemented some such system without really thinking about it, in past days when it was all about eliciting reactions as the GM. There's just no value added for me here, when I've already put close to A$200 into this game (not even including the Gloranthan supps).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

So issues definitely seem to be resolved teething troubles.<br/><br/>As said previously if you want to use fixed resistances for the world there is nothing to stop you. So if you want to have Swordfighter 2W always, then go for it. But this problem is no different to any other game that asks the GM to set the resistance to the player's action such as Burning Wheel. <br/><br/>It is not a problem new with this game and the tools are not that different to those elsewhere. The GM always has rule on the resistance. He can choose to do it from his experience of how hard something is in the real world, he can try to do it from some in-game scale, or he can do it from something else like dramatic logic. But somehow he always has to set the number. <br/><br/>The point of pass/fail is to provide another piece of information in addition to arbitrary gut-feel or in-game scale. The suggested target number is based off the number of successes and failures up to now. So in many ways it tries to avoid leaving it all to GM judgement. For my part, once you accept that the GM is making up resistances in this kind of game, all the help you can get is worth taking. It could be seen as fairer to offer what the pass/fail cycle does and calculate it from the number of sessions played and the number of successes and failures so far. BTW this is not as some have suggested according to the outcome the GM wants, but according to the previous contest results.<br/><br/>But sure you could just avoid all games where the GM ever has to create the resistance, and that is one way to go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/smathis" title="smathis"><img alt="smathis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/smathis">smathis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216547/#Comment_216547" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-05T17:24:37+00:00" title="July  5, 2009  5:24PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Ian, for backing up Jeff's assertion that the PDF fulfillment issues have been fixed. And thanks also for your clarification on the pass/fail thing. For whatever reason, the example earlier didn't get that through to me. I will likely keep my old reference for resistances. For one, it allowed HQ's ability to scale via masteries to really shine.<br/><br/>It's not that I have a problem making up resistances. But I prefer having benchmarks so that the resistances are at least consistent among themselves. I understand having a resistance go up and down based on where a group is in a narrative. But I like for resistances to at least be in the same ballpark. That's what my resistance chart did for me in the past and it appears I'll need it now as much as I ever did.<br/><br/>It doesn't appear that HQ2 prevents me from using it. So no worries there. YHQMV, after all...<br/><br/>I'll probably place an order later this week and come back with my own impressions. I'm buying HQ2 mainly for the new Extended Contests, Lingering Benefits and the Rising Action/Climactic Scene charts.<br/><br/>At least I'm not on the fence about it. And that makes me feel better. Still only getting the PDF, though.<br/><br/>BTW, what was up with "But sure you could just avoid all games where the GM ever has to create the resistance, and that is one way to go."? It seemed dismissive and out of context with the rest of the post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Entech" title="Entech"><img alt="Entech" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Entech">Entech</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216548/#Comment_216548" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-05T17:47:25+00:00" title="July  5, 2009  5:47PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 5, 2009 5:49PM by Entech.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ian said: But sure you could just avoid all games where the GM ever has to create the resistance, and that is one way to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe weird thing about this is this.

I would reply 'HeroQuest 2 is one such game.'<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has the pass/fail cycle. The GM doesn't need to set resistances. You can give the pass/fail chart to the players and they'll tell you what the resistance is.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that's only one way of doing it. The game text also suggests setting them in an arbitrary fashion or lying to your friends about setting them and doing it some other way.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill. It's one of the games that gets me hot because it does provide a system for getting rid of difficulty numbers. I hate setting them. I refuse to do it.

The smug dismissal and finger-wagging wore thin about 24 hours ago. There are people, <i>in this thread</i>, several in fact, who have <i>purchased and read the book</i> and are discussing their impressions with the rest of us. That's not a "meme." It's hardly hearsay; that's as close as we can come to the actual text without forking over a steep 30 dollars for a book or a <i>ludicrous</i> 20 dollars for a PDF. We're all asking OTHER PEOPLE who bought the text because we (or at least I) CAN'T AFFORD to read it ourselves. We're raising concerns based on firsthand reports. We're scrutinizing quotes from the text itself. We're <i>the Heroquest fanbase</i> and we're trying to discern if there is value for us in a new product. And that's our big crime? That's our terrible, terrible failing as the "Storygames community?"<br/><br/>It might help if you addressed people as people. All this "the community" this and "you people" that is really hindering communication. I get the feeling nobody's really <i>in discussion</i> with you; rather we're all <i>targets</i> for you. One commenter (Christopher) pointed out that you were "moving fast" on your posts and said he wouldn't have a repl;y until Monday. You then perverted his comment into some admonition against all the bad, wrong people who disagree with you (essentially "yes, YOU PEOPLE need to slow down and think about the text before you shoot your mouth off"). And then proceeded to double-post your way along the day, with nary a slowing or a stutter in your diatribe. So where Christopher was nice about it, I'll be blunt: slow. the fuck. down. And try treating people like people.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216572/#Comment_216572" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-06T01:11:15+00:00" title="July  6, 2009  1:11AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joel, I think you're reading things into Ian's post that aren't there.

It doesn't cover scene framing, the mechanical reward system isn't aimed at anything beyond "Hero Points for showing up", and it hits "Say Yes", but in a somewhat clumsy fashion.  As I noted above, the GM's advice sits firmly in the 90's, extolling the value of creative collaboration with just a little bit on how to structure that, and some contradictions along the way.  It's definitely not a teaching game as a text.<br/><br/>What HQ2 does do, is provide clear and less kludgy rules from Hero Wars or HQ1, strip away Glorantha as a setting, provide a meaningful set of difficulty scales you can use.  The community resource rules work as a form of group flags, and set up a non-crunchy setting resource tool, which might be interesting to anyone who found Reign, Burning Empires, or Houses of the Blooded too crunchy in that regard.<br/><br/>It would be a good game to go to, provided you're willing to accept some incoherence and drift it, if:<br/><br/>- You haven't checked out the Hero Wars/Hero Quest rules and have been meaning to<br/>- You really like the HW/HQ rules but wanted some streamlining<br/>- You want to use a "mainstream-ish" game as an entry point to introduce dirty hippy gaming to a mainstream group scared off by stuff like Grey Ranks and Bacchanal and are willing to give some drift.<br/>- You want a game that supports improvised Sim play w/o requiring immense prep<br/>- You want a game that gives good tools for pacing Illusionist play and providing the "rollercoaster experience" to a group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216602/#Comment_216602" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-06T08:46:56+00:00" title="July  6, 2009  8:46AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris, <br/><br/>Thanks for the post. <br/><br/>What I'm not clear about, at this point, is how that all makes HeroQuest 2 different than the majority of games out there.

For some groups, that will make it a good meeting point as a game, but I suspect for most Story Games folks, it will not do much.<br/><br/>My personal excitement is that I've always had a love for HW rules, and this version is streamlined and I can hand it to my friends and have them understand it without me having to translate how the hell the game works.  People who've BEEN playing HW/HQ consistently with a group won't need that, and people who are just as happy with TSOY or FATE also won't find themselves compelled to switch systems for novelty's sake either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216617/#Comment_216617" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-06T09:43:31+00:00" title="July  6, 2009  9:43AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just chiming in to say I like the pace of the thread.

If you and your group already have a clear idea about the setting ("We're doing Star Wars during the Clone Wars!") it's really easy to coordinate on what Keywords or traits fit or don't fit. <br/><br/>I expect most of the prep will sit around groups where the GM is trying to communicate a setting no one is familiar with, in which case, the keywords or setting descriptions will tell players what kind of characters to make and what kind of game to expect.<br/><br/>When I mentioned not needing immense prep, I was thinking specifically of sand-box style Sim, where you detail a lot of the fictional world for folks to wander in - because the system is very easy to make things on the fly, AND it does have a useful gauge of difficulty, I could see making it -appear- to be a huge, precreated world, when all you're doing is improvising as you go.<br/><br/>HQ2 also has no expectations of party play built in- you can do 1 on 1 play just fine, player vs. player free for all, or everyone working together.  <br/><br/>Traits are effectively all equal in terms of mechanical power, the big difference being what you can do with them according to the plausibility of the setting (Most settings you can't "Persuade" someone to death, but then, maybe you're playing a Gaiman-esque setting where you can... if the group is on the same page, then the rules will handle it just fine.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216694/#Comment_216694" name="Item_121" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-06T13:09:31+00:00" title="July  6, 2009  1:09PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 6, 2009 1:23PM by NomdePlume.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Melinglor</cite><br/>I am very frustrated because this conversation keeps racing ahead of my ability to read, catch up, and contribute.

One question, where I got the impression of illusionism from was two places.  One, the example of play in the book which is contained in the preview that was released.  Two, in people's explanations of that (which amounted to, you pretend to the player their roll is meaningful).<br/><br/>How does that example of play fit with your take on the game?  Is it not the case that the game encourages the GM to effectively lie to the players about the actual mechanic in use at certain times?  That's where I took issue.

Cultures which are drawn from less-well-known-to-Westerners sources are less well defined and full of shallow stereotypes.<br/><br/>I think that's the argument - I don't know Glorantha well enough to say if it's true. Maybe it's an artefact of the world's developmental history. I'm sure all the cultures started out pretty one-dimensional and stereotypical, and most of the supplements have focussed on the orlanthi-related areas, so of course those areas have become the most detailed and nuanced.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217597/#Comment_217597" name="Item_142" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-09T20:11:44+00:00" title="July  9, 2009  8:11PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2009 8:12PM by Brand_Robins.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It isn't quite so simple as "white cultures are complex, non white ones aren't." It really isn't about skin tone (save in as much as skin tone will always be at issue in any North American discussion of race -- as Chris points out, white folks make up much of the art), so much as it is about cultural imperialism and the divide between cultures done like human cultures and cultures done like fantasy pastiche of nineteenth century imperialist/racist tropes. <br/><br/>Some of the cultures that are very well done have as much Persian or Central Asian background as anything European. But at the same time, despite the obvious love of Indian religion in much of the development of religion in the game, the Teshnos sections can be pretty fucking ungood. And it is possible that further development of those areas would fix it and make it better, but its equally possible that it would make it worse. <br/><br/>However, considering that Glorantha makes such a small part of HQ 2, perhaps we should spin this to its own thread?

What people are complaining about is that it's a -different kind- of Simulationism.  Emulating reality, emulating a fictional magical reality, and emulating a genre, as a focus of play, all fall within Simulationism (as does Illusionism).<br/><br/><br/>Yeah, I guess I was being lose with terms here, because HQ1 was trying more to simulate reality where as this is seeking to emulate a genre. So my bad here.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: smathis</cite>BTW, what was up with "But sure you could just avoid all games where the GM ever has to create the resistance, and that is one way to go."? It seemed dismissive and out of context with the rest of the post.</blockquote>\nSorry, not meant that way. I meant more that some game mechanics don't put the narrator in the position of having to set the resistance, say IAWA as an example. I think there was a thread a while back by someone who disliked games that made him set the resistance. Alex is right that pass/fail gives you a way to handle the task of setting the resistance by offering a mechanical suggestion: figure it out from previous contest outcomes by looking it up in a chart. But HQ2 does not say only use pass/fail it says use it if nothing else stands out.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: balbinus</cite>How does that example of play fit with your take on the game? Is it not the case that the game encourages the GM to effectively lie to the players about the actual mechanic in use at certain times? That's where I took issue. If not, is it just a really terrible example of play or what gives?</blockquote>\nMock contests are really 'anything but a fumble' in a new guise, more than narrator fixes the outcome. We don't use them, so I can't really talk about why someone might want to from actual play, which is what I was trying to help with here. But I can say that you can just ignore them and the game is not affected. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By:</cite>As I mentioned, aside from the community resource mechanic, there's nothing groundbreakingly new here... My personal excitement is that I've always had a love for HW rules, and this version is streamlined and I can hand it to my friends and have them understand it without me having to translate how the hell the game works. People who've BEEN playing HW/HQ consistently with a group won't need that, and people who are just as happy with TSOY or FATE also won't find themselves compelled to switch systems for novelty's sake either.</blockquote>\nTrue, though I like the cleaned up contest mechanics over the older versions. I agree that HQ2 is going to break ground for folks here in gaming terms. But we find its still our 'go-to' game for a lot of what we do, more so others, perhaps because it is quite approachable by people that find some Forge diaspora games intimidating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217781/#Comment_217781" name="Item_148" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-11T08:24:52+00:00" title="July 11, 2009  8:24AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 11, 2009 3:57PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Ian,<br/><br/>Sorry it's taken me a while to get back to you.  I wanted to do a little reading and figure out some phrasing.<br/><br/>First, though, I want to make it clear that I empathise with you jumping in to clean up misconceptions about the game.  God knows that I have little patience for specious and unfounded statement people make about games I'm fond of.  You can root around rpg.net and find threads from years ago when I was beating down people for saying Hero Wars was "broken" -- simply because it didn't resolve conflicts in a manner they were used to.<br/><br/>Second, that said, please understand that my comments did not come out of nowhere.  Though I hadn't read the book yet, I did read comments by Matt Snyder, Chris Chinn, and Denys.  Three smart guys who did the read book, know RPGs inside and out, and who I trust completely.  If one of them alone made the comments, it would be enough for me to sit up and listen.  The fact that the three of them were agreeing is kind of a big deal. <br/><br/>With that in mind, let's look at what I wrote:<br/><br/><i>"The business about the GM cheating and adjusting difficulties to pre-set success or failure matches material I've read on Laws' blog: He's into this whole thing about "rising" and "falling" rhythms of a story based on whether the hero is succeeding or failing (ike a good James Bond movie or whatever). In his view the GM better enforce success or failure to create a compelling story."</i><br/><br/>I also wrote:<br/><br/><i>Laws' is still trying to make sure a GM is the "writer" of a story -- which I'm not interested in. I get the feeling you're not either. But he seems pretty attached to it right now.</i><br/><br/>So, this comment sprang from Robin's blog.  He's been writing about this pacing issue for more than a year, and it was clear he was sewing these ideas into HQ2.  He drew his charts of stories moving up and down, diagraming how a story works as a writer maps these beats up and down.  <br/><br/>Now, this makes little sense to me in an RPG. And full disclosure: any game that builds any kind of "story structure" into it turns me off right away.  In my view structure is built on the fly in an RPG.  The ups and downs will sort themselves out just fine.  The goal is create a game that produces <i>unexpected</i> results with ups and down, with interesting narrative results no matter what the mechanical result.  (Please remember that word "unexpected."  I'll be returning to it in a moment.)<br/><br/>So, I drew my statement from the blog entries. Not the rules.<br/><br/>But then I open the rules.  <br/><br/>I find this: <br/><br/><i>"In other words, HeroQuest starts with story considerations, deciding the difficulty and then working backward to describe physical details in accordance with them. This is the way that authors and screenwriters make decisions. If this were a movie,<b> the writers and director would first of all decide whether the Joey succeeds or fails</b>. This is a structural decision; it determines if the scene continues with a thrilling shipboard combat, or concludes with a frustrated hero sputtering in the polluted waters of the Hudson River. After making this choice, they then construct the sequence to be suitably sensational, however it comes out."</i><br/><br/>[emphasis added]<br/><br/>So, yes, I feel comfortable saying, "Laws is still trying to make sure a GM is the 'writer' of a story."  What we mean by "story" and what we mean by "writer" is still a big pond to play in, but I don't think my conclusions drawn from Laws' blog were that far off the mark.<br/><br/>But then we read this in the rules:<br/><br/><i>"Just as fundamental differences separate literature and film, roleplaying is its own narrative form with its own distinct dynamics. HeroQuest emulates the decision-making of older narrative forms but adapts it to the requirements of roleplaying. Chief among these is the need for uncertainty to surround all noteworthy conflicts."</i><br/><br/>Okay.  So, in movie or a novel, the writer decides success or failure.  But in an RPG there has to be uncertainty.  So we have a die roll.<br/><br/>[Interlude: I need you to understand something.  From this point on I am not <i>challenging</i> anything.  I am confused.  I have questions.  I am looking for clarity.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_217782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217782/#Comment_217782" name="Item_149" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-11T08:25:11+00:00" title="July 11, 2009  8:25AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 11, 2009 11:11AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [continued]<br/><br/>So.  Even though in a movie or novel the creator decides success or failure, in an RPG this doesn't happen.  Which leads to me to ask, "What is this text talking about?  How do these two things fit together to help someone reading the rules understand what to do with the game?"<br/><br/>And then, below these paragraphs there is a chart: THE LOGISTICS OF STORY OBSTACLES.  In it, the GM decides the difficulty based on story needs.  (I'm presuming the GM decides this, but I've read on a couple of threads that the players might determine the resistance.)<br/><br/>I think it's significant that the issue isn't "difficulty" but PASS or FAIL.  The number is set to weight toward and expected <i>outcome</i>.<br/><br/>Now, I may be unique in this, but I have never set values with an anticipation of <i>outcome</i> in any game.  Sometimes the challenges will be tougher or easier.  But this focus on outcome seems peculiar and strange to me.<br/><br/>When I (and others) suggest that the game is written to have the GM push the story one way or another, this is what we're referring to.  <br/><br/>Basically, I'm looking at a chart that says a) I should know if I want a character to Pass or Fail a conflict; and that b) I should assign a low or high resistant accordingly.<br/><br/>Can you explain how this isn't the rules telling the GM to push the outcome on the characters?  At the extreme ends the GM could simply set resistances that are so high or low as to make rolling useless.  <br/><br/>At the less extreme ends, since we're looking for the outcomes first, the question becomes, "What does this mean?"  Why is the GM focusing on a desired outcome.<br/><br/>Now, let me be clear about my own preferences.  One of the reasons I'm in love with the <i>Sorcerer</i> resolution mechanics is that the results of conflicts are wildly uncertain.  There is simply no way to jimmy the conflict mechanic to pass or fail in <i>Sorcerer</i>. The odds are higher or lower, but never certain.  And because of the way the mechanics are set up, what a conflict is about at the start of the rolling of dice is often not what the conflict is about by the time the dice stop rolling: It is possible that enemies will end up becoming allies; that to save a friend a PC will take an action that puts his soul at risk, an action he would never have anticipated before the conflict started; that a PC who starts bargaining with a powerful NPC will end up desperately trying to murder his would be business partner as his own Will is beaten down.  All this happens because of how the dice fall in a series of "concentric" rolls of ever expanding effect and the Players make decisions based on the shifting balance of dice.<br/><br/>When I wrote "unexpected" this is the kind of unexpected I enjoy.  Now, that's me.  But I want to provide the baseline of what I see as really, really fun.  I simply might be blind to something that is right in front of me.<br/><br/>Let's leave aside, for the moment, that the LOGICS OF STORY OBSTACLES is optional and one doesn't have to use it... can you explain to me how one does use it?  Because I honestly can't figure it out.  If one is focused on the desired outcome, based on the needs of story, why the heck is one rolling at all?  The text seems to be saying, "A failure (or a pass) is optimal now for story."  Why then, would one make a roll and risk losing the optimal result?<br/><br/>You're not Robin, and perhaps I should address this question to him.  But I have a feeling he's as knee-deep in his point of view on this as I am in mine.  I'm looking to you to maybe translate his intentions if you can.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper" title="Ian Cooper"><img alt="Ian Cooper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/733/nRK18K7505XHK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper">Ian Cooper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217784/#Comment_217784" name="Item_150" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-11T08:35:27+00:00" title="July 11, 2009  8:35AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 11, 2009 8:35AM by Ian Cooper.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Chris.

So I can see your reading now. It\u2019s not the same as my reading, but that\u2019s not trying to imply that one is more true. Every reader interprets a text according to what they bring with them.<br/><br/>However, I thought I might share my reading of the pass/fail cycle with you, to see if you can see my reading as well.<br/><br/>I think that the main chapter we are concerned with is Playing Stories. My reading of what that chapter covers is as follows:<br/><br/>A pass/fail poetics<br/>Choosing type of contest<br/>Pass/Fail cycle<br/><br/>Let\u2019s exclude the second section because I hope that it is less controversial<br/><br/>Now, in my reading, the first section is Robin\u2019s poetics of the kind of literature HQ2 seeks to emulate. He suggests that you can see it as a cycle of successes and failures used to create tension<br/><br/><i>The pass/fail cycle serves its purpose by allowing the author to orchestrate a pattern of tension and release. p.68</i><br/><br/>But its pretty clear Robin is talking about fiction here not a game. <br/><br/><i>In fiction, the author creates excitement by manipulating the rhythm of successes and failures. p.68<br/></i><br/>He is using this as a justification for picking numbers based on the previous successes or failures of the group. So the point here is to pick up on the idea that in fiction, the difficulty of the obstacle reflects the point in the dramatic cycle.<br/><br/>But Robin is explicit. While the author has control in fiction, the narrator in HQ2 has no such control. Outcomes derive from player decisions and the outcomes of rolls. The narrator reacts to this and does not control it. <br/><br/><i>Narrators, rather than creating a single plot line for the hero to move through, must anticipate that the heroes will either succeed or fail when confronted by any noteworthy obstacle. Either by preparing in advance or through improvisation,they must be ready for the story to branch into many possible stories. The decisions of the players, in tandem with the game\u2019s resolution system, determine which story actually takes place. The result is also a linear story, but the process must be at all times open-ended, so that the players have determining influence over the outcome of the story. p.68<br/></i><br/>Note that pass/fail is used to help set resistances based off previous events. It is an alternative to \u2018narrator determines resistance\u2019 and as such (and Alex pointed out) in many ways less illusionist, because it takes the decision away from the narrator who no longer \u2018authors\u2019 the difficulty<br/><br/><i>To use your pass/fail tracking chart in assigning resistances, check the most recent pair of arrows against the Pass/Fail Resistance Assignment Table, below. Treat each major defeat as two defeats, and each major victory as two victories. p.72<br/></i><br/>So I think that HQ2 is not suggesting that the narrator decides outcome, but allows a mechanic to determine resistance. The pass/fail cycle is a justification for why \u2018the last outcomes\u2019 are a valid way to determine the difficulty of the next outcomes. Pass/Fail is trying to avoid narrator chooses resistance to favor an outcome not support it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper" title="Ian Cooper"><img alt="Ian Cooper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/733/nRK18K7505XHK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper">Ian Cooper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219249/#Comment_219249" name="Item_153" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-18T04:18:29+00:00" title="July 18, 2009  4:18AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like to make one other point though. I can more clearly see how it would be possible to read the text in support of a more illusionist approach as well. I think that the text is perhaps open to both interpretations, and I can see Chris Chinn's suggestion that it is easy to drift into Illusionism. I suspect that may suit some of MD's audience who might prefer that approach. For example my reading of the following paragraph is that it explicitly says: don't railroad or use illusionism to conceal railroading:<br/><br/><i>The narrative style gets a bad rap among some players, who assume that it means an overbearing Narrator will impose on them a pre-determined story, the outcome of which their characters are powerless to alter. These assumptions usually spring from their past bad experiences with uncollaborative Narrators. Address these expectations by allowing the player\u2019s choices to lead your narrative. You might start the game with at least one possible interesting storyline in mind, but should always be willing to abandon it if the players seize the reins and take it in an unexpected direction. Your goal is to move the story toward any thrilling outcome, not a particular endpoint you\u2019ve already envisioned. p.77</i><br/><br/>But I can see that some might read it and not see what I see - don't railroad - in the admonition to abandon pre-prepared ideas and see illusionism - have a detailed story-line that you modify. And I agree there are some paragraphs that look a little less clear. But which reading you take away may have much to do with which reading you are looking for as anything else.<br/><br/>BTW I expect you will see Illusionist game material from Moon Designs. That suits some of their audience. Gloranthan material in particular has had illusionism in the past. But that\u2019s more a warning to the folks here than a suggestion that HQ2 itself is Illusionist.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219252/#Comment_219252" name="Item_154" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-18T05:07:57+00:00" title="July 18, 2009  5:07AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This pass/fail cycle stuff is interesting, since I've wanted to use a similar approach in one of my own games. <br/>Does it talk about using this approach for entire groups, or individuals.

We have done that in the past as we tend to have protagonist not party play.

What people are complaining about is that it's a -different kind- of Simulationism.  Emulating reality, emulating a fictional magical reality, and emulating a genre, as a focus of play, all fall within Simulationism (as does Illusionism).<br/><br/><br/>Yeah, I guess I was being lose with terms here, because HQ1 was trying more to simulate reality where as this is seeking to emulate a genre.

(By you two, I mean, not by RDL, who I think it's clear is avoiding the terminology like the plague, despite the use of "the S word", and the confusing use of the seemingly synonymous "emulate".)<br/><br/>In HW and HQ1 we had a resolution mechanic that had assorted implicit "trust your feelings, Luke" get-outs, but eventually rested on a game-world-specific scale of ability ratings.  In HQ2, we have a resolution mechanic that has assorted now-very-explicit get-outs, and eventually rests on the pass-fail cycle.  Which does not depend, let's recall, on any game-world entity whatever, <i>nor on the particular genre in any way whatsoever</i>.  Are you both saying that this is all indistinguishably "sim", in those terms?\n<blockquote>Alex is right that pass/fail gives you a way to handle the task of setting the resistance by offering a mechanical suggestion: figure it out from previous contest outcomes by looking it up in a chart. But HQ2 does not say only use pass/fail it says use it if nothing else stands out.</blockquote>\nBut surely it's in context also a large "hint" as to what one's "gut" <i>should</i> be telling one, etc, whether or not one is formally using it in a particular instance.  (If one is using it at all, of course.)  It would be reasonable to alternate between a story-based intuition about difficulty and a mechanically story-pacing-derived number;  it would seem much odder to switch between the pass-fail cycle and a game-world based rating, say.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221397/#Comment_221397" name="Item_162" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-29T07:57:11+00:00" title="July 29, 2009  7:57AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 29, 2009 7:57AM by bankuei.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: FergusWindbag</cite> Which does not depend, let's recall, on any game-world entity whatever,<i>nor on the particular genre in any way whatsoever</i>.

It doesn't have to be specific to a genre- GURPS is sim despite being "genreless", even if you're using the rules for magic and superheroes.  In this case, HQ2 emulates climax structures in fiction based on pass/fail cycles.  This by itself wouldn't make it sim, <i>if other factors in the text gave more primacy towards either gamist strategic choices OR narrativist thematic play</i>.  In this case, neither appear.<br/><br/>In short- Hero Wars Narrativist from thematic focus and emphasis on player input to address those themes, HQ1 "incoherent" (mixed advice between Narrativist and Sim play, removal of most direct thematic advice, all Sim adventures included), HQ2 Sim.   Note all 3 games are easily driftable between Sim or Nar.<br/><br/>If you actually care, I'd suggest reading up stuff like Ben Lehman's Intro to Forge theory, otherwise, forget about it and go play the game however.  Big Model theory has proven to be often used online as a bludgeon by a lot of folks who don't understand it as an excuse to argue, rather than to usefully identify how games work and how to make them work in a way you want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper" title="Ian Cooper"><img alt="Ian Cooper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/733/nRK18K7505XHK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper">Ian Cooper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222067/#Comment_222067" name="Item_163" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-02T12:49:48+00:00" title="August  2, 2009 12:49PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bankuei</cite><cite> Intro to Forge theory, otherwise, forget about it and go play the game however.
