Now, the Treasure Island Resistance is a strong community.  Now, we, the children of those children, have the chance to end the war, once and for all.<br/><br/><b><i>This is how."</i></b><br/><br/> -- Archer Lin, Pilot 00: commencement speech on Bliss Day, September 8th, 2030<br/><br/><div>~~~~</div><br/><br/>I'm starting a play-by-post game of Bliss Stage at RPG.net. Set in the ruins of Treasure Island Job Corps, San Francisco, it is the continuation of Final Act, featuring as Pilots and Anchors the children of Sara, Josh, Keenan, and Anna, 15 years after thier successful attempt to destroy the alien base on the dark side of the moon - an attempt that permanently left the moon of the dreamscape shaped like a crescent, the convex side facing downwards. <br/><br/>As the game begins, Sara Smith, now the Authority Figure, is directing her children and the children of her contemporaries to battle against an increasingly desperate alien foe.<br/><br/>As a snippet - blurbs about how she feels about the Pilots:<br/><br/>Archer Lin: "...I saw in his eyes the same lonliness I feel, on the coldest nights, in my cold bed. After seeing that, how could I refuse his small request?"<br/><br/>Casey Lin: "Wonderful. She's... how do I put this?... her father's daughter, all right. Her heart seems to be in the right place - but I'm still keeping an eye on our... ah... 'morale officer.'"<br/><br/>Jon Derek Smith: "My precious baby boy. He walked into this with his eyes open. He knows the risks. He's... making mistakes, but the right ones. Good luck and godspeed, my son."<br/><br/>Ariana Smith: "...it's a game to her, where she gets to be a magical girl who defeats the forces of darkness with the power of love. She is truly my daughter. Maybe that's why I'm so frightened for her."<br/><br/>Noah Porter: "He's suffered so much, and now he's going to suffer more. At least he understands the deadly seriousness of this war."<br/><br/>About 3 missions in, we're going to introduce a new pilot - please take a look at <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=412339" rel="nofollow">RPG.net</a> (you'll have to sign in) if you're interested!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
