All three articles are available for immediate download at http://www.lythia.com <br/>\n<br/>\nLythia.com -&gt; Downloads -&gt; Adventures &amp; Plot Ideas -&gt; Will in the Way<br/>\nLythia.com -&gt; Downloads -&gt; Places -&gt; Goffin<br/>\nLythia.com -&gt; Downloads -&gt; Places -&gt; Henewes<br/>\n<br/>\nWarning: <br/>\nPlease do not read these files if you are a player (or a potential player)! Send this notice to your GM and tell them to download them as soon as possible. Let the GM decide what information you as a player have access to, for your enjoyment of the adventure will diminish if read by a future player. You have been warned! (In fact stop reading this now!)<br/>\n<br/>\nIntroductions: <br/>\nGoffin Manor is a generous single knight\xe2\u20ac\u2122s fee held by Sir Edric Quarne. The fief lies close to less than a league due south from the castle at Olokand, but except for local traffic, the road is little used as most travelers between Olokand and Abriel usually take the more direct route through Iversen. <br/>\n<br/>\nHenewes Village is a satellite hamlet of Abriel Abbey. Its daily governing is done by Abriel\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Reeve for the Rekela (Bishop). The village was once held by Clan Quarne of Goffin but was willed to the Church of Larani as a sign of devotion upon the death of Sir Edren Quarne eight years ago. <br/>\n<br/>\nWill in the Way is a H\xc3\xa2rnWorld adventure module for H\xc3\xa2rnMaster, but is generic enough for other rule systems and can be fit in other game worlds. The adventure is set in northwestern Kaldor, a feudal kingdom in eastern H\xc3\xa2rn and involves the manor of Goffin and the hamlet of Henewes southwest of Olokand. Most of H\xc3\xa2rn\xe2\u20ac\u2122s common people toil in the soil on manorial fiefs, and their lords often have differences with each other. The Lord of Goffin, Sir Edric Quarne, is a caring knight of mediocre fighting skill. Eight years ago the local nobility was surprised when Sir Edric\xe2\u20ac\u2122s father granted a subordinate hamlet to the powerful Church of Larani as a sign of his piety. Now plots have ripened as someone is concerning themselves with the Church\xe2\u20ac\u2122s management of Henewes and the burdens that they have inflicted on the hamlet\xe2\u20ac\u2122s serfs. They are looking for some loyal people of character. Can there be an end to the Will in the Way? <br/>\n<br/>\nDetails: <br/>\nGoffin Manor contains 22 pages<br/>\nHenewes Village contains 12 pages<br/>\nWill in the Way contains 22 pages<br/>\nThese total 56 pages!<br/>\n<br/>\nGoffin, Henewes &amp; Will in the Way are intended to be used with the fanon articles of: Lady of Paladins, Abriel, Iversen, Cyre, Medarsin, and Stybrin, (found on www.lythia.com) and the canon articles of Kaldor, Tashal and Olokand (found from www.columbiagames.com). The Nelafayn Hundred Project website can be found at www.lythia.com/nelafayn/ and contains other local manors that may be used with these articles. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile intended for Harn, the ideas behind this adventure may be used in any feudal kingdom with the locations themselves easily dropped in as is or modified to better fit another gaming world.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
