Kristoffer Apollo, who wrote the article, is a Danish larpwright. Since it's coming up, but so many of us can't go to Fastaval, seems like a good time to talk about their style of play. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.fastaval.dk/the-best-one-shots-in-the-world-the-danish-scenario-tradition/?lang=en" rel="nofollow">The Best One Shots in the World: The Danish Scenario Tradition</a><br/><br/>Kristoffer wrote:\n<blockquote>A noticeable consequence of this theorizing was that Danish con roleplaying quickly ditched systems in the traditional sense. In the mid-90s a wave seemed to sweep over the land and turn everything into \u201csystemless\u201d scenarios. Powered by the argument that if we knew how to structure the scenarios dramatically, what do we need dice and skill checks for? </blockquote>\nThis is the big schism. Though just ditching dice and skill checks doesn't mean you've ditched rules and structures. Drama and the structure of stories can be as essential a system as any set of skill checks and saving throws. But this has lead them down a very different path. <br/><br/>Later:\n<blockquote>[The Natural Born-Holmers] ideas merged with the indie influences to create a new awareness about the importance of system mechanics. And this resulted in both indie-style story games like historical drama Montsegur 1244 (Frederik J. Jensen, 2008) and scenarios drawing more firmly on the Fastaval tradition and merging it with system mechanics, like Medieval drama Joust (Anders Frost Bertelsen, Kristoffer Rudkj\xe6r, Morten Hougaard, 2009), another Absurth presentation.</blockquote>\nSo it takes another turn, to come around to using more formal mechanics once again. I wish I had gotten to play Joust. I've read a translation, but I'd love to know more about how this uses influences of both traditions. <br/><br/>Montsegur's pedigree seems clear: a concrete, conflict-riddent premise, with pre-written characters, some elements of pre-scripted events, but all presented in a flexible format, utilizing randomly drawn elements as a springboard for player creativity.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320102/#Comment_320102" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-12T09:07:29+00:00" title="April 12, 2011  9:07AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Emily-<br/><br/>Obviously, I am a neophyte at all of this, but it sure seems like the big distinction in this style of play is that it tilts WAY over towards the theater side of axis. As a guy with an actual Theater degree, a LOT of what they're doing sounds similar to free-form theater and acting exercises we used to do in class and even for 'fun' at parties and picnics and stuff.<br/><br/>How much of this springs directly out of gaming and heads in that direction, or starts as explicitly theater that evolves the structure to look like a LARP? Or do they worry less about the distinction? JEEP, from what I've seen and heard of it, barely registers to me as a 'game', it's doing a play with some autonomy to improvise the dialogue, if I'm understanding it correctly.<br/><br/>Which is all a way of getting around to wondering whether this is somehow distinctly European or formally 'theatrical' in a way that's particularly challenging for American gamers who come from such a distinctly different tradition. I know my wife who enjoys gaming and even some of the story games (notably Annalise) would be put off by the pressure to be 'acting' instead of 'playing', for example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320105/#Comment_320105" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-12T09:30:01+00:00" title="April 12, 2011  9:30AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeep can be pretty game-y, and Americans take to it like ducks to water for the most part.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johs" title="johs"><img alt="johs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johs">johs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320144/#Comment_320144" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-12T11:57:07+00:00" title="April 12, 2011 11:57AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm sure Americans can play the same things as us euro guys.

The Danes came to their form of dramatic oriented play through table top primarily. In the other Nordic countries, larp was the form that pushed innovation forward. So at least in Denmark, theater looks to have been not a central influence. But the elements of improv and theater are there (playing off of one another and "yes, and..."; knowing a story or a role and running with it based on description and narrative, rather than breaking the fiction down into discrete quantified bits). <br/><br/>The Danes (and?) have a term semi-live, which covers situations where you may shift between table top/descriptive play, to live and back again. Like if you sat down to play D&amp;D, and then stood up to play out a particularly hairy bit of negotiation or combat. <br/><br/>The biggest difference I have found in the lot of these (Danish scenario play, Jeep and various types of larp) from improv and theater (though I've minimal experience with acting) is the changes that come when you are <b>not</b> performing. Performance changes many things physically (in your physical blocking, your delivery) as well as what you're focusing on in play (your emphasis on being interesting/funny at a steady pace so the audience is not bored).<br/><br/>Johs, are the first Danish 1000 scenarios the ones that have been archived?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320176/#Comment_320176" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-12T14:28:11+00:00" title="April 12, 2011  2:28PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The performative aspect of A Day in the Life (I played at Viking Con 27) was radically different from anything Jeepform.

Danish scenarios where some are downloadable.<br/><br/><br/>A Day In The Life and Montsegur are both amazing. They are unique works even from a Fastaval standard. The first is from 2005 and the second is from 2008. The time difference of three years is long in Danish scenario development. Every year at Fastaval is an exercise in wild leaps of creativity and innovation in scenario writing. The two scenarios are also from different (sub)traditions within the Danish tradition. As Apollo writes in the article: "A Day ..." is an ensemble scenario and "Montsegur" is a story game influence. The first story game'ish scenario at Fastaval was Per Fischer's Dark Places (<a href="http://alexandria.dk/data?scenarie=2859" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://alexandria.dk/data?scenarie=2859</a>) in 2005 (the same year as A Day...). Dark Places was like a demo of Ron Edwards' Sorcerer in danish and we Danes were blown away!<br/><br/>Apollo also mentions the "Joust" (2009) as a merge of the ensemble scenario (as A Day) and the story game'ish (as Montsegur). I think this is true and Joust is maybe the best Danish scenario ever.

I think it is another one of our strengths. Everything is written down, so you can keep building on top of other people's scenarios, and you have to write them, so that others can use them. One consequence is also that we have compilations of the best scenarios - such as Project R'lyeh you mentioned - and recently Scenariebogen, a publication with 9 of the best scenarios from the last five years, which is to be given free to all youth schools with roleplaying courses. It also resulted in guides on how to play the scenarios for both players and GMs (for instance the Fastaval Compendia from the last five years) and then there are the Remake-competitions, where we remake older scenarios and win prizes for best remake. The newest competion have just begun (so if you can google'slate your way through the material, you can participate): <a href="http://mgreis.wordpress.com/2011/04/13/konkurrence-remake-sorthvid/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://mgreis.wordpress.com/2011/04/13/konkurrence-remake-sorthvid/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320249/#Comment_320249" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-13T04:21:03+00:00" title="April 13, 2011  4:21AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wilhelm</cite>Story gamers, look at the lists, anything you can't agree with?</blockquote>\nThey are hard to argue with.

Though just ditching dice and skill checks doesn't mean you've ditched rules and structures. Drama and the structure of stories can be as essential a system as any set of skill checks and saving throws. But this has lead them down a very different path.</blockquote>\nWe Danes agree with you nowadays, of course. Even if we thought we ditched "system" back then, it's obvious that we just replaced it with a different set of rules and structures. What makes the Danish tradition baffling to outsiders, however, is the fact that these rules of "systemless" have never been written down. Instead, you have to read or play the actual scenarios to understand the unwritten premises of it all (with rule <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> being that unless you're told otherwise, the GM gets to decide). Though today, most Danish writers are pretty good at specifying what kind of structure they want for their scenario. That's one important thing we learned from The Forge and the discussions it fostered.<br/><br/>Later:\n<blockquote>So it takes another turn, to come around to using more formal mechanics once again. I wish I had gotten to play Joust. I've read a translation, but I'd love to know more about how this uses influences of both traditions.<br/>Montsegur's pedigree seems clear: a concrete, conflict-riddent premise, with pre-written characters, some elements of pre-scripted events, but all presented in a flexible format, utilizing randomly drawn elements as a springboard for player creativity.</blockquote>\nYes, our move away from and then back to formal mechanics is quite different from the American RPG history (everybody's apparently going in circles and will probably meet at the outset again :-). You should know that Montsegur is a pretty atypical Fastaval presentation because of its rather strict reliance on formal mechanics. Joust or A Day in the Life are much more typical of our tradition - having a detailed script and then ad libbing from it. Like Jason mentioned, the GM as the "driver" or director is also very important. Things like GM cutting techniques are essential to the Danish tradition. <br/><br/>Jason also observes:\n<blockquote>The performative aspect of A Day in the Life (I played at Viking Con 27) was radically different from anything Jeepform.</blockquote>\nAnd that is very true of the Danish tradition as a whole. The Jeepers are brilliant at what they do, and they have been a major influence on Danish scenario style in recent years (in fact, I would say that we Fastavallers probably consider them an assimilated part of the Fastaval tradition by now). But the Danish tradition developed differently, so it is more than Jeepform, like Jeepform is more than their Fastaval scenarios. For example, the Jeepform saying of "Everyday drama is more interesting than epic drama" does not hold true at Fastaval because the Danish tradition partly builds on a strong history of epic stories. At the moment, the Danish trend also seems to be scaling down towards everyday drama, but I expect we will see a counterreaction and a move back towards the epic in a short while.<br/><br/>But as a whole, like I believe Tomas observes, there are probably more similarities between the different Nordic freeform styles (Danish/Fastaval scenarios, Swedish/Jeepform, N\xf8rwegian Style) than between those styles and many other freeform styles from the rest of the world. After all, the Nordic countries share many cultural similarities and I believe that fact is reflected in our approach to roleplaying. <br/><br/>But that doesn't mean that everything Nordic is dark and brooding, as komradebob has been led to believe:\n<blockquote>I always get excited when someone starts talking about these Danish (and Swedish and general Viking) forms of RPGs.<br/>But then, inevitably, someone always describes it as something serious or artsy and it just kills it for me.</blockquote>\nI understand where that remark comes from, because so often it's the serious, artsy games that are referred to. I guess because they really set the Scandinavian things apart from many other traditions. But we do actually make comedies and action/adventure games as well. For example, two years ago the Best Scenario award at Fastaval went to a D&amp;D version of Reservoir Dogs. But there is a schism in the fact that more serious stories are more likely to win awards (I mean, look at the Oscars, it's not roleplaying-specific). And when you've looked at a few years' worth of player feedback at Fastaval, you also discover that well-made games with stuff like cannibalism, paedophilia and general dysfunctionality actually seem to be very popular with the players. It's something to do with achieving an emotional high, I believe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320291/#Comment_320291" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-13T09:31:24+00:00" title="April 13, 2011  9:31AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>I really don't want to be the guy dumping on this stuff.

And this was one of the questions that got raised in conversations we had afterwards. So much of the excitement is around the hard hitting stuff (for reasons Kristoffer, Jason and others have already articulated), and although it is said many times (as Markus did in his talk) that there is a ton of classically "fun", adventure style games, the discussion revolves around the darker themed games so it ends up being under-represented. Sounds like it would be useful to spotlight the lighter side of Nordic larp somewhere, if even only as a marker or way to answer these questions. Games like Laura Kalli and Katri Lassila's Romantic Adventure larps, as well as scenarios like Reservoir Elves deserve the spotlight, too. <br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kristoffer Apollo</cite><br/>We Danes agree with you nowadays, of course.

Or, better yet, a visual record of what it is like. Honestly, it would be fantastic to have a series of youtube videos giving a snippet of play from all these styles (North American as well) with some framing discussion and a quick geographical/historical orientation.

So when they speak from certain assumptions or positions, it's often out of that context, which can make cross-boundary communication more complicated.  Yeah, I instinctively reject the idea that more serious or real-life games are somehow "better" than games based on genre fiction, but it's true that the genre stuff does tend to be overwhelming (and a lot of it doesn't look fun to me), so I can imagine why people might think that (even if they're still wrong).<br/><br/>Still, I don't think there's yet a large number of people with enough experience in all sorts of international or diverse roleplaying circles -- though thankfully, that's increasing steadily -- for communication to be super easy yet.  I mean, American indie games are still pretty divorced from American larp traditions (Mind's Eye Theatre, boffer larp) and online freeform and a bunch of other "domestic" gaming traditions.  So talking with folks from even more distant backgrounds often means taking the time to talk out assumptions, even when they seem crazy or distasteful.  More interesting to me is why Tomas thinks "classic" roleplaying is a "clumsy baby" and what his "beautiful and dangerous, grown up" roleplaying is supposed to look like.  Maybe I'd hate it; but maybe not.<br/><br/>This is really a do-as-I-say-and-not-as-I-do thing for me, partially because of the kerfuffle that happened with Mo Turkington's "push and pull" terminology when that got appropriated and thrown around, often out of context (and I feel responsible for some of the misuse in that regard, because I was excited about it and wanted to use it as a weapon to fight my own wars in carving out space for the types of games and play that I was excited about).<br/><br/>Anyway, just a note that it's important to acknowledge our own context and local wars and not expect ideas or people from other contexts and battles to really be able to move seamlessly between them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320300/#Comment_320300" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-13T09:56:06+00:00" title="April 13, 2011  9:56AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 13, 2011 10:00AM by komradebob.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding Emily's suggestion for videos or essays on the hidden systems at work: <b>Yes, please!</b><br/><br/>I'm finding that there are a number of forms of gaming that look like I'd really enjoy them that have a ton of unwritten but vitally important systems to them.<br/><br/>A couple of other quick thoughts:<br/><br/>I've noticed that this Danish tradition seems to lack the Fear of GMs we see over here.

Please note that the article Emily originally linked to is specifically written in the Fastaval context, and even in that context it is only a summary of the most influential trends and subgenres of the last couple of decades (as I believe I acknowledge in the piece). But I do believe it makes sense to talk about a Danish scenario tradition because for the last 15-20 years, there have continually been a good number of scenario writers working in that tradition, with their scenarios referring to each other, using and further developing common techniques etc. It is one of the benefits of having the scenarios written down in detail.<br/><br/>And by the way, how are we ever going to discuss different playing styles if we have to know them all intimately to do so? :-) Though Jonathan's point is very well taken - you have to be aware of the limitations of your own experience when entering these cross-cultural discussions.<br/><br/>One of the cross-cultural misunderstadings may indeed pop up in relation to Bob's question:\n<blockquote>I've noticed that this Danish tradition seems to lack the Fear of GMs we see over here. Can anyone comment on this? Does the one-shot nature of these games and short running time play into this?</blockquote>\n... because what exactly do you mean by "Fear of GMs"? But guessing, I presume it's got to do with the distribution of power between GM and players, and the fact that in Danish scenarios, we willingly hand over everything to the GM and say "you decide if nothing else is specified"? From talking with Americans and reading American games, I believe you are hitting a major difference spot-on here. It is my impression that a deeply rooted part of mainstream American roleplaying is the understanding of the GM as an opponent to the players (the guy who's controlling the dungeon, the obstacles, the monsters, whatever) - and that understanding is still present in many "indie" games. Whereas one of the unwritten rules of the Danish scenario tradition is that we are in this together, with the goal of everyone having the best roleplaying experience possible. So many scenarios give the GM a lot of power because we believe it will be used to everyone's benefit. In addition, you could say that many modern Danish scenarios moves the GM into a strict directing role, with the GM being responsible for setting up a framework, and the players acting out whatever they want within that framework.<br/><br/>But writer control vs. GM control vs. player freedom is still a hot subject in Danish scenario-writing circles - it is still being widely discussed. Personally, I think that the decision on how to distribute control vs. freedom should depend on what you intend to do with a game. One size does not fit all.\n<blockquote>The other thing I noticed from just a quick skim of some of these is that they seem to be very focussed, but also scenario/setting/character specific ( with a good bit of room for interpretation/ad-libbing). Around these parts, there are a lot of very focussed story-games, but they seem to still follow the American Traditions of having lots of text taken up describing how to create characters, setting, scenario, etc. Anyone care to comment on these cultural differences?</blockquote>\nYes, these Danish scenarios are exactly that: Written for the specific purpose of being run in specific time slots by a number of GMs at a specific convention. Hence the very specific setting and characters, as they are meant to be ready to play by any GM and whatever players sign up for the scenario at the convention. And that context is then responsible for the very detailed descriptions of plot, characters etc.<br/><br/>Compared to the U.S., I believe the big difference is commercial. Denmark is a small country (5.5 million inhabitants), so we have no domestic RPG market to speak of. So where American game designers aim to publish their games, the Danish scenarios are written for events run by gamers, with peer recognition being the driver. When you aim to publish a game, it follows that you need to make something that your customers can use at home, with their friends - hence you need to allow them to create their own characters and all that. The Danish scenarios are written for a specific use, typically at a convention - and because of that, that tradition has allowed the writer to take total control of every part of the game. But still, the goal is ultimately to create great roleplaying experiences for the participants.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_320332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320332/#Comment_320332" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-13T11:33:32+00:00" title="April 13, 2011 11:33AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>The downside is that the seriousness and artiness, not inherent in the design structures but in the culture surrounding them, undoes the gains made in accessibility.</blockquote>This is really you construing downsides where none are. People being serious "undoes" nothing. Quite the contrary ...<br/><br/>Designers being serious about their work, was a <i>premise</i> for challenging the slightly stale thinking surrounding classical role-playing games.

Many American roleplayers wouldn't consider some American indie games to be roleplaying either. When you have the fringe in one country talking to the fringe in another country, things are bound to get crazy.  For example, this kind of thinking:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kristoffer Apollo</cite>Personally, I think that the decision on how to distribute control vs. freedom should depend on what you are intending to do with a game. One size does not fit all.</blockquote>\n...is pretty well accepted in American indie design circles right now. People aren't going to judge you if you write a game with a strong GM, weak GM, no GM, whatever, as long as it makes sense for what you are trying to do. But that's not always clear because there's been more consistent movement towards codifying what exactly the GM does in different games and to give the players more "content authoring" abilities than they would have in more traditional setups. That's mostly a design trend, though, and doesn't mean that we hate GMs or think strong GMs are inherently bad.<br/><br/>Honestly, I'm super fascinated by non-commercial game design and play communities, partially because I wish we had a stronger one here.  Really, there's one building in the undercurrent of the American indie community, where you can just show up and play whatever, no matter if it's a commercially published game or not, but it's not even the mainstream of indie games, much less the mainstream of roleplaying in general.<br/><br/>Can I ask a bit about the social context of the Danish (and Nordic) communities? Do people have regular "home games" of this stuff or are these kinds of scenarios mostly pulled out for the big conventions and regional meetups? For example, I have a hard time imagining -- and maybe here's my stereotypes of this kind of play coming out -- showing up at someone's living room once at week to experience something really tragic and terrible, with a new group of characters every time.  Also, I would get sick of playing one-shots indefinitely and want to have some consistent play with a more or less consistent group of characters.  How does that work?  Map out for me a typical month in the life of a Danish (or Nordic) roleplaying enthusiast who's plugged into scenario-style play.  How often do they play?

But not always. Sometimes we just play D&amp;D and whatnot. I know Apollo are playing some really classic D&amp;D and has a thing for superhero games. Currently I play Earthdawn and before that my group and I played Mouse Guard and Warhammer FRP.

It seems to have created some extremely well rounded players.  I can see something similar developing here in time. <br/><br/>And, Jim, I was wrong! Or at least there was more info in the article that related to your question:\n<blockquote>And the aforementioned Troels Christian Jakobsen drew upon his background in drama to introduce the structure inherent in most Western storytelling to scenarios. If you have studied drama, literature or even journalism, you will know the structure of Exposition, Conflict, Point of No Return, Climax, Denouement. The scenario version of this theory became known as the Fastawood model.</blockquote>\nThis is illuminating!

You can almost read something like, "A story can often benefit from having less lead characters than actual characters. There is no rule that says everyone should have equal direct impact on the story or equal screen-time," and think "Primetime Adventures' Screen Presence rules".<br/><br/>There are a few things that jumped out at me, however. A few sentences that hint at some history "behind the scenes". For instance:\n<blockquote><br/>A certain level of immersion should always be strived for, or we'd be back in D&amp;D hell. However, total immersion is not suitable for telling a story or conveying a message. Immersion will create a separate story for each character.</blockquote>\nInteresting!

Walton</cite>Can I ask a bit about the social context of the Danish (and Nordic) communities? </blockquote>Yes, of course. You ask, and we try to answer.<br/><br/>Here's my tentative answers ...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Walton</cite>Do people have regular "home games" of this stuff, or are these kinds of scenarios mostly pulled out for the big conventions and regional meetups? </blockquote>I do home-stuff (that is: playing with friends) and "rpg-salons" (inviting strangers to my living room), and I do a lot of traditional campaigns, with friends and others.<br/><br/>At conventions I do a lot of specially prepared scenarios, in both classical and modern role-playing games. I have used our local con in Oslo; Arcon, to experiment a lot with my classical frpg Fabula, and have arranged a fair share of modern games there too. In HolmCon, Matthijs' "come-to-my-home-con", I've arranged even more modern games the last years. And, in addition, I do a lot of improvised games at cons; the so called "free form" games.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Walton</cite>For example, I have a hard time imagining -- and maybe here's my stereotypes of this kind of play coming out -- showing up at someone's living room once at week to experience something really tragic and terrible, with a new group of characters every time. </blockquote>My modern games do not lend themselves to campaigning, so those are one-shots. And I frequently invite strangers to my house, to test them. Having strangers is better, in my view, when testing. <i>Sidenote: it may be that a Norwegian is hastier in inviting strangers into his house than other nationalities (including the Danes, I believe).</i><br/><br/>Playing tragedies, as some of my modern games are, I find as interesting for a night as playing comedies. Most of the people visiting my house, playing tragedies or whatnot, tend to find it worth their while.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Walton</cite> Also, I would get sick of playing one-shots indefinitely and want to have some consistent play with a more or less consistent group of characters.  How does that work?  </blockquote>As I said; I play both classical campaign games and modern one-shots. And I play classical one-shots too. Playing both, I could not really say if I would get sick of playing one-shots indefinitely. I reckon it would depend on the quality of the games ...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Walton</cite>Map out for me a typical month in the life of a Danish (or Nordic) roleplaying enthusiast who's plugged into scenario-style play.  How often do they play? How many things are they working on at once, etc.</blockquote>Oh boy! This vary a lot! I'm working, on and off, on from 2 to 5 projects at once. Fabula is a life-time commitment, so that is always on the agenda. My series "Acting for all" is a serious commitment, and is to be nine games in all, when finished. That will take me years, as I aim for superb design in each one of those games. Besides these two I have singular projects, going for a week or a month, and some of the time two or three of them at the same time. That is my <b>design</b>.<br/><br/>My <b>playing</b> is with four weekly groups in Fabula, campaign style, paid and professional. One biweekly campaign in Fabula, privately. Shorter test-campaigns running from time to time, for a month or a half-year. And then I arrange the odd rpg-salon (playing and discussing rpgs), and a lot of one-offs; ranging from once a month to five times a week. Most of the one-offs are modern, but there are some classical one-offs too, approximately 20-30% of them.<br/><br/>From that stuff you will have to extract "the typical month" ...<br/><br/>BTW: I am totally crazy about role-playing games, of course!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320373/#Comment_320373" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-13T14:22:27+00:00" title="April 13, 2011  2:22PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 13, 2011 2:23PM by Emily_Care.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johs</cite><br/>Fun fact: only 2 out of 11 authors in the collection used the Warhammer system in their scenarios.</blockquote>\nEmpire is wonderful.

The Danish one-shot scenarios draw a lot of inspiration from movies in their dramatic structure.<br/><br/>Going back to your earlier question, I believe that quite a lot of Danish players use some tools and tricks from the con scenarios in their campaigns at home. But which tools and how they apply them probably differ a lot. In addition, some choose to play "limited series" at home, i.e. a campaign lasting a set number of sessions. In that format, it's probably easier to incorporate ideas from scenario play.<br/><br/>And I do think that some of the tools and techniques from the one-shots could be reshaped to appear as options in more traditional, home-play oriented systems. But that again boils down to choosing the best tools for your purpose, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kristoffer%20Apollo" title="Kristoffer Apollo"><img alt="Kristoffer Apollo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kristoffer%20Apollo">Kristoffer Apollo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320377/#Comment_320377" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-13T14:42:50+00:00" title="April 13, 2011  2:42PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 13, 2011 2:43PM by Kristoffer Apollo.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Emily Care</cite>There have been several sets of games submitted to Fastaval, correct?

A different take on the concept was presented at last year's Viking-Con where a group of writers all wrote remakes of the same scenario. So the players got to play several (very) different versions of that same scenario - which turned out to be really interesting. We're doing it again in the autumn, at this year's Viking-Con.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_320387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320387/#Comment_320387" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-13T15:56:51+00:00" title="April 13, 2011  3:56PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kristoffer Apollo</cite>some choose to play "limited series" at home, i.e. a campaign lasting a set number of sessions.

Somewhere in your brain there must be a dark and sinister downside screaming for you to become ... serious? ... artsy?<br/><br/>LOL<br/><br/>Shit man, I try to ignore that voice all the time, but it just keeps screaming no matter how much cement I pour down the hole.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_320450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320450/#Comment_320450" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-14T00:07:14+00:00" title="April 14, 2011 12:07AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thing is; to enact a positive change in a medium of expression, by exploring the possibilities in the known edges of it, we need to take it serious. Regarding something as art, is taking it serious. The thing we design can still be aimed at fun. And it may not. <br/><br/>The Danish scenario-tradition has explored more serious themes as part of their positive change of role-playing games as a medium. So has Norwegian and Swedish designers. And some American designers are doing the same. <br/><br/>Exploring various <i>themes</i> is as large a part of developing role-playing games, as exploring various <i>methods</i> of play. By embracing this fact, we enable ourselves to reach further, and leave behind the preconception that role-playing games are what they are. They are not, and never will be. This medium of expression will change, continually, as do any other medium.<br/><br/>Have a good day, Robert!

In fact, many of these aspects remind of stuff I've seen on the fringe of the historical wargaming hobby ( context/scenario-specific design, non-commercial nature of scenarios, games designed to be played at conventions, success by peer recognition, putting a lot of trust in the GM/Ref/Scenario Creator-presenter, weirdoes talking to weirdoes widely seperated in real world physical distances, experimental rules/structures, etc).<br/><br/>Back to the Fastaval Danish play tradition though: How did it come about that scenarios bean to be written up and passed around to be presented by different GMs rather than just the creator of the scenario. I saw some mention of that, but I'd like to hear more about how and why that developed, and how it became a fixture of Fastaval gaming.<br/><br/>Tomas: I don't know if this kind of experimentation will inherently improve roleplaying. that strikes me as a rather lofty goal.<br/><br/>However, I will note that I personally am a lot more willing to experiment with something short and sweet, that doesn't require a huge amount of commitment in the long term. That's pretty much the exact opposite of the mindset of the general RPG/SG produced to be a commercial product, where there are multiple levels of time and money commitment expected, and the RPG culture seems to orbit around that concept.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kristoffer%20Apollo" title="Kristoffer Apollo"><img alt="Kristoffer Apollo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kristoffer%20Apollo">Kristoffer Apollo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320889/#Comment_320889" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-16T04:52:52+00:00" title="April 16, 2011  4:52AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 16, 2011 4:53AM by Kristoffer Apollo.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Back to the Fastaval Danish play tradition though: How did it come about that scenarios bean to be written up and passed around to be presented by different GMs rather than just the creator of the scenario.

Maybe it comes from these events being run by gamers for gamers - it has always seemed logical to us that if many players wanted to play the same scenario, the convention should try to provide them with the possibility to do so. So you get the centralized sign-up for everything, the convention recruiting additional GMs as needed, and a modus operandi where you get a piece of paper when you sign in at the con, showing you which games you're gonna participate in. I suppose that piece of history also shows that there has been someone with good organizational skills involved from the beginning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>History of Danish Freeform - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14128/history-of-danish-freeform/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="History of Danish Freeform - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14128/history-of-danish-freeform/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Thanks, people!
