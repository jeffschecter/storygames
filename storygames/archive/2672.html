When something pops up, and someone says "No, no way, uh-uh, I veto that," then you know you've got an issue.  Then you can talk about it, and you're likely to be doing something productive.  Negative evidence (of the "I did it and nobody bitched about it") is good enough to operate on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is <b>hard</b> to find out the things that everyone likes for the game.  There are two problems:  First, negative evidence (of the "Nobody's said they <i>wouldn't</i> adore playing gritty Care Bears in a world of thaumaturgic slave-feudalism") is pretty much worthless.  Second, you really want something that <b>everyone</b> enjoys, so having one person unilaterally say "Oh, I think this would be cool!" does not necessarily mean that you've got something that has any decent chance of being productive.<br/>\n<br/>\nRandom, unilateral shots in the dark followed by group discussion are one tried and true (and inefficient) method.  Another way is to try to go from broader categories ("I like Sci-Fi") to narrower ("I like Cyberpunk!")  Also inefficient, IME.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think that huge laundry-lists of what you can do are a game-design method to let people decide on their favorites by process of elimination.  Everybody removes the things they aren't stoked by from a finite list of options, and eventually you narrow down the field:  "No, I don't want to play in Greyhawk city again ... how about the Sword Coast?"<br/>\n<br/>\nOtherwise, though ... how do we <b>do</b> this very important thing?  How can a game give structure that helps people to create/discover their common interests in order to pursue them together?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61351/#Comment_61351" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-16T13:32:18+00:00" title="March 16, 2007  1:32PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 16, 2007 1:40PM by Andy.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Usually, it seems to pass because of initiative, usually by the GM:<br><br>A: (the usual GM) "Hey, let's play Shadowrun next"<br>(grumble grumble)<br>B: "I love that game"<br>C: "Yeah, but we just recently played it.

On top of that, we are geographically dispersed, which makes it difficult to have a discussion involving everybody.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the solution we came up with is that whenever we are planing setting up another game, everybody pitches in a private forum whatever he is interested in playing or GMing. Once the list is drawn we have a votation following the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method" rel="nofollow">condorcet method</a> lasting one week: you vote for all the games you are interested in a wiki, giving priority to those you favor most. Once the week is over we compute the winner (given our group size, you can do it on the fly), which is the current group's consensus game.<br/>\n<br/>\nWorks pretty well, never heard a complaint about the procedure. The results are often interesting, because they give a detailed description of the current interests of the participants. Sometimes a game we thought had limited interest in the group turns out to have a strong support, which gives us motivation to prepare something in that setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kesher" title="kesher"><img alt="kesher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kesher">kesher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61373/#Comment_61373" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-16T20:36:08+00:00" title="March 16, 2007  8:36PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Nobody's said they wouldn't adore playing gritty Care Bears in a world of thaumaturgic slave-feudalism"<br><br><br>Adore it, hell---Tony, I would <i>pay</i> you to write that game...<br><br/>Aaron                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arturo%20G." title="Arturo G."><img alt="Arturo G." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arturo%20G.">Arturo G.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61389/#Comment_61389" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-17T04:32:55+00:00" title="March 17, 2007  4:32AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>So, a second method of process-of-elimination ... but instead of going from a list provided by a game designer, you work from a list generated by the most driving player(s)?</blockquote>\nSomething to have on mind is how the Universalis tenets phase works in actual play.<br/><br/>The players pro-actively introduce ideas paying a coin. Any tenet may be challenged by the others, spending coins, if they don't like them. Typically, challenging is a hard counter-measure, used only when you really "hate" the last tenet introduced. It leads you to be constructive on the others ideas. Sometimes the first thematic tenets introduced highly leads the deal. Sometimes not,, because the new tenets really distort the original one, leading to a different style or setting. However, the focus on the tenets is only build during play. They introduce only a general idea to start building.<br/><br/>Do you like this dynamic?

This is actually much like in sexual relationships, where you can have decent sex when you go with "what both like", but you'll start having sex that blows you away only if you start going with "what really, really turns you on and I can still handle", and vice versa.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, this works better on a smaller content based level, like e.g. the Kickers in Sorcerer. But I guess it can also work at a larger scale ("you are really, really jazzed about Carry, so yeah, why not, let's give it a try even though I'm not particularly interested in it"). For this to work, you need (a) a willingness to really try your best to get engaged and (b) a fair distrubtion of whose "holy shit YES" gets explored when and for how long. One player's enthusiasm may very well catch on the others that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61397/#Comment_61397" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-17T09:59:14+00:00" title="March 17, 2007  9:59AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That assumes that there is something which is "holy shit YES!" for every person.

Here're some campaign premises I'd be up for running." I tossed out about 6 quick concepts (one or two sentences, only bare bones stuff).<br/><br/>Interested players emailed me. I asked, "Which of those campaign ideas intrigues you?" <br/><br/>We narrowed it to two concepts we liked, and then finally down to one. "Let's meet and talk about it," I said.<br/><br/>We met. We didn't play anything, just got to know each other a bit. We talked about what we each brought to the table interms of game experiences and playstyles. We talked about what we wanted out of the game, and kicked ideas around. The result was an agreement on what the campaign would be about, tropes, style, mood, all that stuff.<br/><br/>So far it's going very well. We did our chargen as a group and came up with some great stuff, and we're getting to know each other better. As the GM, this gave me a raft of ideas and the ability to tailor things to their characters more, and give everyone what they want.<br/><br/>Our first session is coming up soon! :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61429/#Comment_61429" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-18T10:36:44+00:00" title="March 18, 2007 10:36AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This reminds me of how I order pizzas for a dozen people.<br/><br/>Typically we go around the room for five minutes having people say what they want on a pizza, and having other people disagree, suggesting other toppings, wanting different combinations and half-pies and such. I don't talk at all, just bringing up "no anchovies," to which everyone says "duh." Then, just as some people are ready to opt out, I suggest something entirely different that no one else brought up, and everyone goes for it.<br/><br/>It's bizarre to see this in action - if you even realize it's happening. I've run games the same way: all my potential players kibitz about what sort of dungeon crawl or supers game they'd be interested in, and then I suggest (insert bizzaro game with no relation to those) and everyone's like, "Yeah, awesome!" I think it's just watching for the "holes" in their suggestions and seeing where they line up.<br/><br/>--Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61441/#Comment_61441" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-18T14:18:39+00:00" title="March 18, 2007  2:18PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2007 2:29PM by MikeRM.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've collected three <a href="http://www.csidemedia.com/wiki/pmwiki.php/MGS/Decision-Making" rel="nofollow">decision-making pregames</a> on my planning wiki which may be of some interest - Consensus, Vote and Veto and Bidding.<br/><br/>EDIT: A few people have whispered me to say the link doesn't work for them.

When the game is played before everybody gets to the "holy shit YES!" point--especially in one-shot games--you don't get the most mileage. But when you throw out a couple ideas and wait until you have people saying, holy crap I want to play<i>this</i>character, it can be just amazing.</blockquote>\nMy experience of PTA pitch sessions has never, ever, <i>ever</i> gotten everyone to a "holy shit YES!" point, because by the 2-hour mark everyone is so sick of brainstorming and so painfully aware of the time that everyone's willing to just say "okay, that'll do, whatever," just so we can play <i>something</i> before it's too late and everyone has to go home.<br/><br/>And it's not just that not all the players are interested in being excited about a game (though certainly there are one or two who I suspect just "want to be <i>content</i>"): I think my group in general is simply ill-suited for the brainstorming process.  For one thing, we've got a couple of people whose ideas are typically waaaaay different from what other people in the group like: their suggestions are either going to be something they like that no one else will support them on, or they'll self-edit and only suggest things that they are lukewarm about but fit in with what the rest of the group likes a bit better.   And in the best case scenario, nearly any subject, style, or concept you name is only going to get an enthusiastic buy-in from 20-30% of the group at most with no objections from the remainder.  When we get that, we generally have an awesome game with lots of fun all the way around, so it's not like we're suffering too badly over here.  (Also, "compromise" and "designed-by-committee" and "collaborative" are not phrases that score highly with them, and I suspect that built-in antipathy--whether justified or not--works against PTA brainstorming.  There's a lot of "well, <i>he</i> seems to really want to have this in the game exactly the way he proposed it, so even though I don't really care for it, I'd feel bad about making changes to it" and "I'll just put this idea on the shelf for a time when I'm running my own game and can do it justice" going on behind the scenes.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frank%20T" title="Frank T"><img alt="Frank T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Frank%20T">Frank T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61447/#Comment_61447" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-18T14:49:42+00:00" title="March 18, 2007  2:49PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Obviously, not everyone has a common ground with everyone else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61460/#Comment_61460" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-18T16:56:50+00:00" title="March 18, 2007  4:56PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A useful word invented by one of my friends: "prodivalent".<br/><br/>"I'm prodivalent" means "all those options are good, not only do I not mind any of them, but any of them would in fact be very cool, as cool as any of the others.

Fire spreads. So does enthusiasm. If one person finds something that really jazzes his or her imagination, that person will start sparking creatively and coming up with neat things that spark other people's imaginations, which means those people will start coming up with neat things, which will spark other people -- it's a virtuous cycle.<br/><br/>This, by the way, is proably why the unwieldy traditional hybridization of rules-referee, antagonist-player, world-builder, and real-life social organizer that we call "the GM" has lasted so long.<br/><br/>Here's a deeper thing: What people get enthusiastic about is rarely something as broad as a genre ("let's do cyberpunk!" in Tony's example) or even something as specific as a particular setting-and-rules combination ("Ohhh, Underdark!" in Andy's). If you push people, they are usually responding to something crazily specific and idiosyncratic that strikes a profound psychological chord -- maybe particular image they find cool (e.g. a two-sword-wielding reverse-albino leather fetishist with pet panther), maybe a specific story-pattern (e.g. for me personally, certain kinds of parent-child revolving around withheld approval, the struggle for independence, and forgiveness).<br/><br/>You can't get to common ground by narrowing down from a general concept that everyone finds something appealing in somewhere -- especially since a general concept will mean radically different things to different people: "cyberpunk," for example, may strike one person as cool because of ghostly, super-sentient AIs, and another person as cool because of the snickety-snick fingerblades and implanted mirrorshades. You <i>can </i>get there by broadening out from from a specific idea that some specific person finds strongly appealing -- especially if you give everyone else opportunity to contribute their own idiosyncratic coolnesses that mesh with the original trigger idea, and above all if whoever contributed the original idea is not just willing to tolerate other's contrbutions, but outright eager to change and evolve his or her original idea in response to the coolness of others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61548/#Comment_61548" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-19T11:02:51+00:00" title="March 19, 2007 11:02AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I've been thinking about this "Go along with what makes another person excited" advice for ... quite a while ... before responding.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I think y'all are wrong.

I do <i>not </i> think you get it by going around the table and have everyone add one story-element (color, character, conflict, setting element, whatever) in turn, because that begs for disconnection.

(Probably you should be able to spend type-1 resources to vote <i>down  </i>other people's elements you just can't stand). Then -- err, somehow -- the actual game-mechanics would build off the set-up: A story-element that got resources below a certain threshold would just go away, like a political party with too few votes in a parliamentary election, and other story-elements are more or less powerful when invoked in gameplay (e.g. conflicts) depending on how many "votes" they got (type 1 and type 2 combined) in the initial setup.<br><br>Hey, damn, I think I'm going to try to use that for <i>apocalypse girl</i>.<br><br>P.S.: I'd link to my post on the Forge about building setting out of generative rules (e.g. "the Evil Galactic Empire seeks to prevail by brute force, numbers, and treachery") and inspirational images (e.g. "Laser swords!"), but the Forge is busted at the moment.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61567/#Comment_61567" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-19T13:58:30+00:00" title="March 19, 2007  1:58PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sydney, what you're talking about with the whole iterative weighted vote sounds a little like the "Load"/network-creation phase of <a href="http://verge.legendary.org/index.php/Verge_Reprogrammed" rel="nofollow">Verge</a>: there, the players are each taking turns, spending story tokens to create new stuff and ratifying/vetoing stuff other people created.

If you've already got a group that's guaranteed to love the same things in roughly similar amounts, it could work; but if not, it seems like you're just coming up with a really pretty and kinda fun mechanic for developing a setting you will never, ever want to use in a game.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg" title="Sydney Freedberg"><img alt="Sydney Freedberg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg">Sydney Freedberg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61577/#Comment_61577" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-19T19:53:11+00:00" title="March 19, 2007  7:53PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt; ideas that only one or two people genuinely love won't get ratified<br><br>Interesting, but presumably solvable: you make a ratification mechanic where any one person saying "Yes!

That's the common ground to build from, not just because everyone likes them but because everyone will understand referecnes to said shows.<br><br>I'm codifying this in my anime game, where everyone sharks up a list of anime titles they've seen or are comfortable with (or just their favorites) and compares them, creating a master list of anime that *everyone* has seen or is comfortable with. For playtest, I'm using a list of all the anime I've seen (120+ titles), with checkboxes in front of each title, one for each player. Those with a lot of checkmarks (hopefully from all players) will become the frame of reference for everything else *and* (as with PTA) hopefully will begin to suggest tropes, themes, characters, and situations that interest everyone.<br/><br/>I admit to not having tried this yet, but I'll be doing plenty of playtesting in the coming months. If there's anything generic about this process that works, I'll try to post it back here.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61641/#Comment_61641" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-20T14:21:10+00:00" title="March 20, 2007  2:21PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Steve H</cite>Im only new to story-games but this topic is something I have been giving quite a bit of thought to of late.

It works very well in play.  However, I'm not sure I'd use it for every game I ran or whatever.  Like, it's perfect for Inuma. But I would be hard-pressed to use it for D&amp;D or some other game I was running (if it was a game with a GM).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61643/#Comment_61643" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-20T15:12:13+00:00" title="March 20, 2007  3:12PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 20, 2007 3:16PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think it's necessarily always a problem if only one person is "holy shit YES!" about a particular thing, either...so long as including that thing isn't something that turns everyone else off.  (It also helps if there are one or two other people who <i>like</i> that thing even if they don't <i>love</i> it.)  This may even be true for a shared-narrative game, but I don't have any proof of that.<br/><br/>For example, one of the guys in our gaming group is really gung-ho about intrigue.  If he's running a game, there are elements of intrigue all over the place in it.  They make for fun games, because even though the players don't all have the same love of intrigue that he does, he delivers <i>great</i> intrigue and there's always room for individual PCs to connect to different parts of it in different ways.  For a traditional GM-player setup, this is ideal: he's getting what he wants, the players are getting what they want (or at least are having fun without putting up with stuff they emphatically do not want), the world keeps on turning and the songbirds chirp merrily all around us.  <br/><br/><br/>(As a side note, things weren't nearly so idyllic when we tried taking that trad-game intrigue success into a shared-narrative setup or a setup where the setting is developed by group consensus.  When we did an "Alias"-esque action-spy show in PTA, we found that either the people who weren't as good at intrigue as him were inadvertently blunting his best material with their contributions, or--more commonly--people were totally opting out of getting involved in his intrigue-related contributions because they just weren't as into it as he was and didn't want to mess up his flow (surprisingly, these were often the players of the PCs in his traditional games who were <i>always</i> coming up with awesome schemes and pushing the story along!).  A couple of our players made the point that while they really like playing in an intrigue-based game, they aren't so hot on <i>running</i> an intrigue-based game: a lot of the pleasure they take in 'em is a direct result of our intrigue-master's creative input, and if there's going to be any intrigue they'd rather cede most of the control over the plot/scene/framing to him.  What I'm wondering is whether this is something that anyone else has seen in their own games, and if there's a solution other than "don't even bother trying it" when dealing with a game element that everyone agrees they enjoy but most would prefer not to have creative control over.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61644/#Comment_61644" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-20T15:17:39+00:00" title="March 20, 2007  3:17PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I busted my ass trying to find another solution and ended up with 'don't even bother trying it'.

I realized that a voting/auction/point-buy process only works once everyone is on board with all the story-elements being considered; you have to select the elements themselves and make sure everyone's cool with them before you start weighting them, because no numerical weighting system that I can make simply enough to use around the tabletop is any good at distinguishing "one person is enthused about this and no one else cares, 1x10 points + 4x0 = total 10 points" from "five people think this is kinda okay, 5x2 points = total ten points."<br/><br/>So, step by step:<br/><br/>1. Free discussion and brainstorming until everyone is satisfied.<br/>2. Write down a list of story-elements (aspects of the setting, motifs, themes, etc.) that have come up in the brainstorming (and that anyone still cares about).<br/>3. For a story-element to become "canon," it must have (a) one person who enthusiastically likes it, (b) a second person who likes it a lot, and (c) no one who really dislikes it. In other words, you need a nomination, a second, and no veto from anyone in the group.<br/>4. Once you have the list of canonical story-elements, each player (including the GM) gets X number of points to divide among them. The more points a story-element gets from all players, the more mechanical impact it has in the game when it's invoked.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61750/#Comment_61750" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-21T14:19:26+00:00" title="March 21, 2007  2:19PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good combination of the possible approaches, Sydney.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61756/#Comment_61756" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-21T14:28:19+00:00" title="March 21, 2007  2:28PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Glad I could help, sounds like you're getting there!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg" title="Sydney Freedberg"><img alt="Sydney Freedberg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg">Sydney Freedberg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61916/#Comment_61916" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-23T06:49:31+00:00" title="March 23, 2007  6:49AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, guys.
