                    I've put up an AP report at the Forge for the Beast Hunters game I ran on Saturday at the Ennead Game Night:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=23071.0" rel="nofollow">[Beast Hunters] Ennead Game Night</a><br/><br/>Here's a vignette:<br/><br/>The best challenge was a fight with a pack of half-crazed wolves in a ruined village on their way to the Tarrag mountains. The characters picked up on the sounds of the wolves and climbed onto nearby ruins, and were thereby able to figure out a plan while the wolves were still approaching.  They placed Gabe's character as bait at the end of a narrow alley, with the other characters on the flanking rooftops. The cool thing is that they all gained advantage points for doing so many different actions that helped win the battle: Gabe's character distracted the wolves and constantly looked for more advantageous positions and escape routes. Matt's character invoked his spirit guide to tell him who the alpha wolf was, then charged into the fray calling the wolf out by name. Charles' character started a fire and rained down burning debris and planks on the mass of wolves. And Nick's character, in the action I valued the highest (maybe because I've been playing too much God of War recently), kicked up one of the wolves whose fur was on fire, grabbed it, and proceeded to bash the other wolves with their own burning kin.<br/><br/>All throughout I was happy to award them rather high advantage points despite the fact that their traits were low compared to the wolves, because their actions were all just so different and cool. Finally, after maneuvering around the wolves, Gabe's character charged the lead wolf who was by now flanked by the other characters and, using all of those reward points from earlier strategizing and maneuvering, delivered a powerful fatal blow that won the challenge (rolling 4D6: 6-6-6-4).                </div>
