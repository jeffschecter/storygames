I suspect at that number we'll want to write down character information for the benefit of the other players, and obviously I'll need to find an extra counter and a d6 from somewhere.  Has anyone tried it with more than six?

The only problems are that the game will last quite a while and the group needs to be OK with the social implications of having more players - more characters to keep track of, more downtime and so on. Somebody will probably have to leave early and somebody else just joined the game because nothing else was going on, too, as the increasing number of players increases the number of personal disruptions as well.<br/><br/>The six players thing is something of an arbitrary cut-off point that's based on my own play with different numbers of players. Seemed that the games with more than six players usually weren't very successful simply because a significant fraction of the players in that large a pool gravitated into passive hanger-on position while the people actually interested in the game took center stage. I imagine that this could well be different if you somehow got a large number of motivated and skilled players together.<br/><br/>Another reason to pick six players as  the cut-off point is that when we go to more than that it becomes a simple matter to split the group and play on several boards. You could even have players shift between the boards at times for more challenge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel" title="Anarchangel"><img alt="Anarchangel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/333/nG33DU7UK4MTS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel">Anarchangel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189650/#Comment_189650" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T17:46:04+00:00" title="January 22, 2009  5:46PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 22, 2009 5:46PM by Anarchangel.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Eero. If the time estimate on the box of 30 minutes per player still holds, we should have enough time without disruptions. Especially since I rarely see games last that long. The multiple board idea is interesting; I'd love to try that at a con sometime.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189686/#Comment_189686" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T23:33:42+00:00" title="January 22, 2009 11:33PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Three and four players are both accaptably large groups.

It wasn't a very profound session though. It was very silly, and I suspect the large group is directly responsible for that: less intimacy (I've played at least two very touching games of Zombie Cinema, with 3 and 4 players) and more showing off. Still, you can pull it off if the players are committed. It wasn't much longer than some four player sessions I've played in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
