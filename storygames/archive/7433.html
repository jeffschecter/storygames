Allow me to field this one.<br/><br/>Inevitably people will want to call one of the Joe's "Big Joe". This literally ALWAYS happens. The trouble is that each and every time, there are strong cases for all the Joe's to be called Big Joe. This will not dissuade people from wanting to differentiate the Joe's by use of the "Big" prefix for only one of them.<br/><br/>The following is a supplement to "I'm with you, Joe!", designed to play with multiple Joe players, multiple Joe characters, anti-protagonistic Joe's, and inconsistently named characters who occasionally fulfill a Joe role in a social group.<br/><br/><b>Big Joe(s)</b><br/><br/>While playing I'm with you, Joe, as a Joe (in or out of character), you must strive to be Big. Big is a word with several nuances, and might mean:<br/>*Loud<br/>*Using a lot of space with movement and stance<br/>*Fat<br/>*Tall and broad shouldered<br/>*Deliciously sexy in a Scandinavian, post-Grunge sort of way<br/>*Long-winded and prone to dominating social space<br/>*Self-assured that you are witty and very intelligent<br/><br/>Choose from this list 3-5 Big Traits that will describe the Joe you will play (or play as) in I'm with you, Joe. Continually embellish these Traits through play. Disrupting play through the embellishment of your Big Traits is a valid play tactic <i>while playing (or playing as) Joe</i>. At any point in the game someone can say in a bombastic, deep voice "Big Joe!". This has no game effect but to impress upon people that in their opinion you are a Joe, in one of the game's many Joe capacities.<br/><br/>Endgame<br/><br/>At the end of the game, whoever was last called Big Joe permanently becomes the Big Joe. People will incessantly call him Big Joe between game sessions now.<br/><br/>Future Sessions<br/><br/>In future sessions of I'm with you, Joe, if there are multiple Joes or multiple people wanting to be a Joe, Big Joe automatically trumps them all and is the Joe (Typically, the Big Joe will declare this fact by saying, "But I'm... BIG Joe."). If there are multiple Big Joe's, they both permanently lose their Big Joe status and the game is played with multiple Joe's vying for Big Joe as per the above rules.<br/><br/>Playtesters<br/>I would like to thank anyone who has played with me and Big Joe (I was labeled Rockstar Joe).
