I ask because the particular word choice of "fix" isn't clicking for me, and I'd love to find out more about what you mean by "fixed power list." <br/><br/>Eero, I went and dug up a thread on the The Forge you started (<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=9544.0" rel="nofollow">Sorcerer's Demon Rules</a>), and while it dealt with many interesting things (that I'm still pondering) I didn't see it really tackle this notion of fixed powers.<br/><br/>The reason I'm asking is because I don't see the powers as fixed.  As Jesse illustrates in this thread, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6076&amp;page=1#Item_6" rel="nofollow">[Practice: Sorcerer] Demon Abilities</a>, Demon Abilities are like lego blocks that you can mix and match in various combinations to create the powers you want a demon to have.<br/><br/>But.... that's just how I see them.  I would love to hear how <i>you</i> see them.  This is both a matter of the <i>Sorcerer</i> rules presentation of the Abilities in the text, as well as how they work mechanically.  Any and all of it will be interesting to me.<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196195/#Comment_196195" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-08T17:41:32+00:00" title="March  8, 2009  5:41PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, that's an old thread. Didn't even remember writing that one. Quite funny that I bitch about the same thing in that thread. It's also notable that I find my point well presented in that thread - those same system aesthetics issues are still on the forefront of my mind when I consider the demon rules. I won't claim any authority or expertise in this matter, as I haven't played nearly enough Sorcerer to claim deep insight, but that thread does make a good job of airing my layman reaction to those demon rules.<br/><br/>My reasoning about the demon ability thing is pretty simple: the trade-off in having many abilities (meaning: flexibility in your demon) is a high Lore score, as each Ability increases it by one. This rule is easy to preserve even without defined demon power lists: just have the GM list the different powers a demon has in natural language, count them and assign Lore. Provide a powerful generic rules engine for adjudicating what happens in the fiction and let the GM apply it to demon powers as necessary. The way I see it, this simplification would have a couple of effects: it would somewhat reduce in-built game balance (that is, how powerful a demon you get for a given Power score), which is not a problem in this sort of game, and it would reduce the emphasis the game has for demon design and procedures of utilizing demons. The latter is really what I'm after, because Sorcerer seems somewhat petty at times with the detail it lathers on what demons can and can't do - a slightly more relaxed and poetic interpretation would fit better for me, something where a demon with "fire powers" could have leeway for improvising effects related to fire as necessary instead of being limited to causing special damage.<br/><br/>I should also note that I do understand and appreciate the lego block nature of the demon powers, as well as their abstract and fictionally flexible nature. I just don't understand why this subgame of demon construction is in the game. Its main effect seems to be to make players keenly aware and worried about the boundaries of what their demons can and can't do. I don't off-hand see why this is desirable in this case. (Note that I certainly appreciate crunchy rules when they have a function. In TSoY, for example, the crunch is so integrated into the fiction that choosing powers for your character is essentially the same as choosing their cultural identity. This makes for interesting game content.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196196/#Comment_196196" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-08T17:44:21+00:00" title="March  8, 2009  5:44PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, your original question: in that thread I meant "fixed" as in "each power is described in painstaking detail, and demons are built by combining those powers". This in contrast to the approach I sketch in that old thread - you could just have the GM assign the powers as a list of Keywords HeroQuest-style with no internal mechanization needed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
