Now, each judge already answered a list of questions when they were in the running to be a 2010 ENnies judge and you can read those answers here: <a href="http://www.ennie-awards.com/about/judges.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.ennie-awards.com/about/judges.asp</a><br/><br/>For this interview, we will ask more focused questions. We'll come up with questions on our end but we also want to open the floor to questions from the fans. And that's what this post is for. Feel free to comment below during the next week and we will pick the best five to 10 questions for the judges. Thanks in advance to everyone who asks questions.<br/><br/>Tony Law<br/>ENnies Assistant Business Manager                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
