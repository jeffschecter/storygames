I'm not saying that I'm playing the game right, so please point out if there's anything wrong but don't try to defend the game. I played Fiasco three times now and I didn't like any of the sessions, even if one was praised by the others, one had two cool stories and one ... well, no one thought it was a good session.<br/><br/>Fiasco is a GM less game where it will go to hell with most of the characters. You got a lot of playsets to choose from, even if they are mostly sceneries that forms the mind of the participants. The really cool part is that you play out most of the scenes through dialogue and dialogue alone. But when I play I get a creative block from the game. Why?<br/><br/>One thing in roleplaying games that I really like is when I can contribute with ideas and help create a mood or maintain it. Once upon a time I really liked getting in the character and play the shit out of different roles. Not that much any more. It takes to much effort for what I feel that I get from the game, and I feel that I played most of the parts that I can play. Also, Fiasco forces you in how to play your role by making the others choose if it's going to be a good or a bad end in the scene in combination with having the scenes played out as dialogues. I have nothing against being restricted in how I should play my character - I love how I have to choose one of the six moods in <b>Psychodrame</b>, but that will always leave me a choice. Fiasco don't. So why don't I just choose how the scene should end? Because of what I wrote in the beginning of this paragraph: I also like to contribute to the scene. I noticed if another participant lets the others create a scene, I'm the one in 70-80% of the times that suggest that new scene. That's when I can shine as a player in my area of expertise. But that's pretty much the only time I can shine. So I got two choice, either being forced in how I should play out my character so the scene ends good/bad or I can sit quietly and let the other players have a fun time.<br/><br/>And how about when there's a scene that my character isn't in it. The only thing I can do is to sit and listen. Sure, that's fun in itself, but why am I then playing?<br/><br/>Fiasco forces you in another way. The end game. The end game that you roll doesn't have anything to do with what happened during the game. Someone who got just white dice can still end up in prison. I did. Things worked out for me and I wasn't even in the last scene - that ended in a shootout. Still, I ended up in prison for some reason. Like I said before: I have nothing against restrictions but I want to choose which one to use. Why can't the game just count the number of white or black dice and then give me three suggestions to choose from?<br/><br/>Finally the relationships. I have little choosing in how my character will end up with any kind of relations, which could be good, but in this game it's not. Relations can be sorted into three categories: active agendas, reactive relations and passive relations (traits, stuff, locations). Some of the relations in Fiasco are agendas, but a lot of the relations are passive. They don't do anything - they just are there. According to me, all personal characters should have an agenda - something to strive for, or at least have something to react to. My character last time had a vague goal to get high (agenda) that was ignored by my partner, a place (passive), a work relation (passive) and a reactive relation (desperate manager and a singer). I was the manager who looked out for my next star, so anything that happened to her was in my interest. But out of the four relations, there were only one to use: the reactive relations, which put my outside of everything that happened. This has happened two times out of three, where I more enjoy listen to the other peoples stories than my own. Sure, that's fun in itself, but why am I then playing?<br/><br/>Even if I don't like Fiasco, I still think it's a good game. In the next post I will address why.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<span id="latest"></span> <div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403977/#Comment_403977" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-18T08:22:00+00:00" title="January 18, 2013  8:22AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is interesting stuff.

I don't appear to share Fiasco's design ideals (I'm pretty much burned out by the whole collaborative storytelling premise), but it's easy to play and seems to keep its promises.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403981/#Comment_403981" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-18T09:00:32+00:00" title="January 18, 2013  9:00AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 21, 2014 8:07AM by Rickard.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now to the fun part. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I haven't read the game, so I can't say anything about how it's written.<br/><br/>The idea of playsets is sheer brilliance. It gives an easy way to build out the game, much like some computer games companies that design the games so it can be modded by their fans. The playsets also provides tropes that will form how the relations should be interpreted.<br/><br/>Talking about relations. A relationship map can be hard to grasp, but by extending the creation of relationships to more than just yourself, you get a collaborate creation of the map. Everybody will learn each others relations in an easy way. Yes, I did say that this was one of the things that made me dislike the game, but I would've liked it if it was handled in a different way.<br/><br/>Talking about praising what I dislike, here's another thing: the outcome of the scene. First of all, the choice of letting you frame the scene or handling the outcome of the scene is a really sleek and intelligent solution of one of the troubles in collaborate storytelling games. Sometimes you have an idea of how your story should go, but other times you have no idea. This mechanic has embraced that. Also, letting the non-participants of a scene to decide the outcome of a scene is a way of creating active listening, which is always good.<br/><br/>Another thing I like about the outcome if the scenes is that it's a refinement of a structure that almost all storygames have: frame a scene, play up to a waypoint, roll a die, frame a new scene. This is a really shallow way of handling things, where you always strive so each scene end up with that Really Important Die Roll. I don't  understand why people rolls die if the outcome is one of two possible (fail or succeed). It also gets really repetitive, and some storygames like <b>Mouse Guard</b> or <b>Lady Blackbird</b>, tries to break this by having refreshment scenes or similar. Fiasco is more true to this by acknowledging that there are only but two outcomes of a scene (This is why I started to play <b>D&amp;D4</b>: the game was more honest about what the game was about than the previous versions).<br/><br/>The structure of the game is easy to understand, it breaks off very nicely and it's easy to add stuff like playsets too. If you played with one playset, you know how to play the game, instead of having to learn a bunch of new stuff. Brilliant design.<br/><br/>Related to the structure, but deserves a paragraph of it's own, is the time it take to play a session. You get a full session with no preparation and everybody to participate in all phases within two hours. This means that you can play it with non-gamers during an evening, or play two different playsets with your gaming group after each other. Exemplary!<br/><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aj7NcdDh-WM&amp;feature=relmfu" rel="nofollow">Fiasco creates cool stories</a>. But if I imagine myself being one of the players around that table, I wouldn't enjoy <i>acting out</i> any of the parts. Fiasco doesn't suit my style of gaming ... but I can still acknowledge it as a good game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403986/#Comment_403986" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-18T09:26:02+00:00" title="January 18, 2013  9:26AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 18, 2013 9:27AM by Mathalus.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool stuff.

However, when you gave others the go ahead to frame the scene, we jumped all over it and left you dangling. We'll all be watching to see how you react, and none of us know yet why you killed the cop. We'll have to watch and see. <br/><br/>Does this kind of framing seem more interesting to you or is it too pushy? Do you like the thrill of being thrust into an uncomfortable situation?

I would like it, but not in dialogue-driven games like Fiasco. If anyone framed a scene like that for me, I would be more interested in what that person had in mind than me reacting to it. There is good and bad "Haha, now you're in deep shit" moments. The good ones has build ups, either by foreshadowing in previous scenes or by creating something during the scene, but it's a little over the edge to ask me to unprepared create a build-up from another person's idea.<br/><br/>So in Fiasco, it would be waay to pushy if I was the only main character in the scene.<br/><br/>I do like the idea  of rollercoasters (it means that the action rise and falls, right?). I like movies like 24 Days Later, Ringu, Saw 1, the American version of Let the Right One In and Coraline (big surprise for me), but not Alien (loved it when I was younger - to slow for me now), The Shining (zzzz!), The Blairwitch Project and Omen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404004/#Comment_404004" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-18T13:59:42+00:00" title="January 18, 2013  1:59PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you framed scenes with an agenda in mind or is it all "Let's see what happens when these characters talk to each other?"<br/><br/>I've found that scenes can kind of flounder if no one in the scene is aggressively pursuing an agenda.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404008/#Comment_404008" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-18T14:56:37+00:00" title="January 18, 2013  2:56PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also called the "Need". <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Cool analysis, I could easily see why I don't have those issues.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404026/#Comment_404026" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-18T20:13:31+00:00" title="January 18, 2013  8:13PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 18, 2013 8:13PM by Nathan_H.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never had one time playing Fiasco where it got all wacky.

It's hard to address an agenda (or "need" in a more Fiasco specific term) when the character doesn't have one. Sure, you can create your own agenda while playing, but shouldn't the game help you with that? But to answer your question: yeah, it's usually the characters that has agendas (that frames scenes to address them) that shine during the sessions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_404041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404041/#Comment_404041" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-19T09:40:23+00:00" title="January 19, 2013  9:40AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the problem with Fiasco is that the way its 'boxes and arrows' work short circuits the feedback loop I get in Improv, and it only moves from mechanics -&gt; fiction. And as an 'audience' member I don't particularly want to see 'good' or 'bad' results, so it doesn't matter to me if I get or hand out black or white dice, and spending dice often doesn't have an observable impact on the scene they're spent on either. All of which means the one mechanical decision pivot during play is meaningless to me.<br/><br/>See, I can play an RPG where <i>I</i> have an objective, and I can play an RPG where my <i>character</i> has an objective, but in Fiasco I don't have an objective (which is not the case for everyone of course), and my character can do nothing <i>in the fiction</i> to work towards an objective (they're not Establishing or Resolving scenes, I am).<br/><br/>Mind, I still enjoy playing it with folks, but the system doesn't add anything for me, and might even interfere a bit with what I enjoy from Improv and gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404043/#Comment_404043" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-19T10:39:40+00:00" title="January 19, 2013 10:39AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can you tell me more about the feedback loop?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404049/#Comment_404049" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-19T13:46:27+00:00" title="January 19, 2013  1:46PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 19, 2013 1:46PM by Nathan_H.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I'm playing Fiasco and I'm wondering what does my character want, I've goofed up somewhere along the way.

When framing a scene, don't say "Ok this scene is our characters at the diner talking." Say "This scene is about our characters psyching themselves up to rob the diner at gunpoint."<br/><br/>The resolution mechanics of handing out black dice and white dice to determine the outcome of a scene only make sense if there's a clear good outcome and bad outcome from the start. While the former can end up with the opening scene from Pulp Fiction by chance, the latter framing will explicitly go for that scene.<br/><br/>A character's agenda does not have to be a Need in their relationships. In the example I give above there's no explicit Need being focused on, only a Location, but there is a clear agenda to the character's actions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404124/#Comment_404124" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-20T11:36:04+00:00" title="January 20, 2013 11:36AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The rest of this thread is quite interesting, but I just want to call out one thing no one else has mentioned.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;I noticed if another participant lets the others create a scene, I'm the one in 70-80% of the times that suggest that new scene.&lt;&lt;<br/><br/>...Yeah.

If they give you a die before the scene, it's a "let's see you do it this way now!" And if they give you a die after the scene it usually just confirms the ending you reached "That seemed like it went well for your characte,r" or puts a new spin on it "That seemed like it went well for your character, but why don't you tell us why it actually screwed him." <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404307/#Comment_404307" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-23T07:25:39+00:00" title="January 23, 2013  7:25AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The way it has gone down when I have played is that the die is almost always given at the end of the scene.

I don't recall anything in the rules about that; and I've played many scenes where there's a lot of descriptions of action and scenery. That said, I can't recall ever having a completely no-dialog scene (... in ANY game system, come to think of it) excepting maybe right before Aftermath, where scenes are piling one on top of the other and folks are just chaining their scenes into one big dogpile of descriptive additions (via continuing the same scene).\n<blockquote>...I feel that I played most of the parts that I can play.</blockquote>\nWow! Really? Perhaps you should push some boundaries on the roles that you assume? (I'm not saying "badwrongfun," but damn... that's hard to imagine, for me, and I've played RPGs for over 30 years!)\n<blockquote>Fiasco don't. So why don't I just choose how the scene should end? Because of what I wrote in the beginning of this paragraph: I also like to contribute to the scene.</blockquote>\nAnnnnd, ya lost me.<br/>1) Choosing the outcome doesn't mean you do NOTHING to establish the scene--you can push back some, if the others are framing too aggressively (e.g., "So as your character lies bleeding out on the floor...").<br/>2) Once a scene is framed, you have as much power as any other player to interject additions to the scene, change pacing, shape scenery, etc, etc, etc. It's not 'listen as the others puppet your character through the scene, then chime in dolorously with the details of the outcome that you've selected.'\n<blockquote>So I got two choice, either being forced in how I should play out my character so the scene ends good/bad or I can sit quietly and let the other players have a fun time.</blockquote>\nSee above: I think you've been mis-trained or have assumed too much restriction in the RAW.\n<blockquote>The only thing I can do is to sit and listen. Sure, that's fun in itself, but why am I then playing?</blockquote>\n*blink* Um. No, that's not all you can do.<br/>If your *character* isn't in the scene, and the other *players* don't think your effort to include it is valid (i.e., they call bullshit on some addition to the scene), and if there's no need for any other (N)PCs in the scene, AND if you aren't allowed to influence the outcome (i.e., you established), THEN... you can still made sidebar comments, suggestions when others get stuck, or background noises to help establish mood (assuming none of those things HARMs the mood of the scene--don't butt in just to be making noise with your mouthparts!).<br/><br/>I... I think you should re-read the RAW (and the Companion, if you can get ahold of a copy). I'm only half way through your post and I think your premises are so off-base that I'm not sure that any conclusions you will draw below will be sound.\n<blockquote>The end game that you roll doesn't have anything to do with what happened during the game.</blockquote>\n*blink*<br/>You DO know that the dice you've been given (Act I) and kept (Act II) are what you roll to do dice math for yourself, for Aftermath result...?<br/><br/>The events of the game's scenes DIRECTLY impact the Aftermath, barring the (somewhat frequent with beginners) equal-die-color outcomes (i.e., high volatility, low average result).<br/><br/>But, hell... I've played the metagame of die colors to force all SORTS of stuff, which in turn informs the fiction, which in turn can make one virtually guarantee Aftermath results (in a general "good", "neutral", "bad" sense).\n<blockquote>Someone who got just white dice can still end up in prison. I did.</blockquote>\nPerhaps you should hack out randomness--just set every die value for the "Aftermath Roll Result" to 3.5 and do straight math.<br/><br/>It seems you don't like the (intended) way in which insane twists hit Coen-like plots...? Why SHOULDN'T the guy who came out smelling like roses every scene get hit buy a bus walking out of the bank with his briefcase full of money?\n<blockquote>Why can't the game just count the number of white or black dice and then give me three suggestions to choose from?</blockquote>\nBecause your play group hasn't decided to do it that way (though I think my 3.5-per-die way, above, is easier to hack immediately into existing Aftermath Tables and stays closer to the source inspiration).\n<blockquote>Relations can be sorted into three categories: active agendas, reactive relations and passive relations (traits, stuff, locations). Some of the relations in Fiasco are agendas, but a lot of the relations are passive. They don't do anything - they just are there.</blockquote>\nerr... Relationships, or Elements? I think you mean the latter.... <br/><br/>One skill you'll develop will be thinking of Objects and Locations more abstractly, as "meta-Needs", or metaphorically.<br/><br/>[I still suck at this skill, but I'm told it's useful! For instance, I almost never engage with Locations because I just can't... engage with them. Even if attached to one of my Relationships... I just can't bring myself to care. I feel more like I'm trying to 'tag all the bases' when I lamely set a scene at it 'just because.' But we all have much to learn at the Alter of Fiasco....]<br/><br/>And, nope, you don't have much agency in setup. Wait until you start playing with folks who gleefully assign dice across table, not to *their* Elements but to &amp;yours*! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>That's the point of the game, as I see it: quick start, crazy play, crazier outcomes (in fiction) and pushing HARD against the players (in metagame... and possibly in Lines &amp; Veils, if that's your gig).\n<blockquote>According to me, all personal characters should have an agenda - something to strive for, or at least have something to react to.... This has happened two times out of three, where I more enjoy listen to the other peoples stories than my own. Sure, that's fun in itself, but why am I then playing?</blockquote>\nSounds to me like it's not the game for you because:<br/>* too much randomness<br/>* not enough direct control over your PC's fate<br/>* aversion to your PC's failure<br/>* uncomfortable with asymmetric character spotlight time<br/><br/>Nope... it's not for you at all, if you require or even prefer the opposite of those four.<br/><br/>BUT, I'd still say read the rules again, read the Companion, and just trust it to work; BUT ONLY when you're willing to engage with its core premises and stop second-guessing the mechanics.<br/><br/>You've basically picked up a shotgun and are disappointed that you can't snipe with it. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>HTH;<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404427/#Comment_404427" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-24T14:05:41+00:00" title="January 24, 2013  2:05PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>One house rule I've used is that everyone has to take a side on the Need(s) by the end of Act One. </blockquote>Interesting.... I'd perhaps add "or has invested in the pursuit of an Object" because they often drive plots, in my experience.\n<blockquote>The resolution mechanics of handing out black dice and white dice to determine the outcome of a scene only make sense if there's a clear good outcome and bad outcome from the start. While the former can end up with the opening scene from Pulp Fiction by chance, the latter framing will explicitly go for that scene.</blockquote>Maaaaybe.... I'd have to see it in play and compare to my past experiences. I <i>can </i>say that we've never been so explicit as this, cons or home games or otherwise. I'm not sure how it would change the discovery/reaction that I so enjoy....\n<blockquote>But players often put their dice in before, or worse, AFTER the scene is finished, which doesn't give me a clue as to what they want me to <i>react</i> to during it.

What am I encouraging?</blockquote>\nI've thought about this, and I *think* the point is to prevent an early dogpile on a PC that pretty much forces its Aftermath.<br/><br/>But another point *might* be that it's a metagame way to steer the Tilt to specific players (i.e., either to help them get engaged OR because you think they make interesting choices with their rolled dice).<br/><br/>But it *also* might be so that you have less control over your character's die accumulation, lest folks try to force monochrome outcome colors (and, thus, predictably positive Aftermaths).<br/><br/>Or it *could* just be to circumvent the "always resolve, to maintain control of My Guy" mentality. You don't *have* control, in Fiasco. It's all an illusion....<br/><br/>[I've been reading too much Grant Morrison this week....]\n<blockquote>Basically my character's actions should be informing the dice should be informing the character's actions, and I don't think that's happening.</blockquote>Hmmm... The first half happens (with non-metagaming players). The second half happens... later... either giving you likelihood of narrative authority on Tilt or informing Aftermath.<br/><br/>I think you're just wanting that loop tighter. But, hell... I've had rolls in other RPGs not "inform the fiction" for several session! Fiasco is done in one session. (Or three, now.) Is waiting for the Aftermath so jarring?<br/><br/>Interesting....<br/><br/>Oooo! Or read this:\n<blockquote>I think the idea is supposed to be, if they give you a die during the scene it will either reinforce where you're headed or throw you a challenge to change it up on the fly. If they give you a die before the scene, it's a "let's see you do it this way now!" And if they give you a die after the scene it usually just confirms the ending you reached "That seemed like it went well for your character", or puts a new spin on it "That seemed like it went well for your character, but why don't you tell us why it actually screwed him."</blockquote>\nThis. *blink* wow....<br/><br/>Now I WANT to try different outcome timings!

I feel like most players decide positive or negative at the table using the context of the whole scene  But I have seen multiple players play towards getting all white dice or all black dice (just by playing the scenes certain ways, not by grubbing for dice) for the entire play through and had interesting stories. In fact, I did this at one con. I played the captain of the submarine with the mythos-esque cargo. I played a stereotyp[ical sexist male captain (I played him straight but condescending, not for comedic effect) that dismissed and disregarded all the zombie/mind-control horror happening around him. Consistently I got black dice because he was causing misery and mayhem everywhere he went. For instance, when a female character approached him with news of zombies, he would have her detained in the brig until her hysteria passed.<br/>In the end he got a new zombie-free submarine from HQ. It was great story telling and everyone wanted my character to die an ignoble death, the fact that he got a promotion and accolades made the story that much more interesting.<br/>  I am not sure a non-Fiasco game could have produced that sort of fiction.<br/><br/>  Now, don't get me wrong, this relies on playing characters that evoke strong emotions in the audience. You get luke-warm/meandering play when the characters are not either sympathetic or actively pursuing their own goals. But with a good sized group, at least one or two characters will emerge with these properties and play flows fairly well.<br/>  Does that make sense?<br/>Dave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405024/#Comment_405024" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-30T10:32:14+00:00" title="January 30, 2013 10:32AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 30, 2013 10:32AM by Wordman.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I haven't read the game, so I can't say anything about how it's written.</blockquote>\nUm... read the game.<br/><br/>From your original post, it sounds very much like most of your issues with the game exist because you are playing "the game the guy that taught me thought was Fiasco" instead of "the game the author of Fiasco told me was Fiasco". <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405025/#Comment_405025" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-30T10:46:39+00:00" title="January 30, 2013 10:46AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played it pretty much <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aj7NcdDh-WM&amp;feature=relmfu" rel="nofollow">like this</a> -  playing out scenes mostly through dialogues.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405030/#Comment_405030" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-30T11:51:04+00:00" title="January 30, 2013 11:51AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Rickard, thanks for starting this conversation!

Everyone plays a little differently, in my experience.
