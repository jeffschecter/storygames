It seems really good! I'm going to play it this weekend. Most of my questions have been answered by reading really carefully several times. But a couple of questions remain. Hopefully someone here has played it and can answer.<br/><br/>1: Can the scene end without the knife being put down? Pretty much the only example in the book is of a demand which is "I must marry a daughter of the Li family". That's a demand that can't be met within the same scene, normally. Does that mean that the scene can end and the receiver keeps the knife until the marriage has taken place? Is that why taking the knife with wirework can be useful? Or is the example intended as "You must promise that I can marry a daughter of the Li family"?<br/><br/>2: The book says "If you take the knife, you get to re- spond as though you were given it by the person you just did Wirework with." This doesn't make sense! You are only given the knife accompanied by a demand. If you take it, there's no demand, and none of your options make sense (like "accept" or "escalate"). Is this supposed to be used to take the knife to be able to make a demand yourself? If so, I'm assuming you're taking it from someone who holds it, since otherwise you don't need wirework to take the knife. And in that case is the demand on the original holder nullified? I don't understand this thing.<br/><br/>I think those are my only two points of confusion. I'm super excited to try this game!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464919/#Comment_464919" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-20T16:02:40+00:00" title="July 20, 2017  4:02PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and one more question:<br/><br/>3: You get to add a chip of your own color when you're in a set "that you own". What does it mean to own a set? The rules say that a set, once used, is placed in the middle of the table, so it doesn't seem to mean "a set you defined". Is it a set your character has possession of? Like their house? Or is is a question of you having set the scene and described the set?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonP" title="JasonP"><img alt="JasonP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wishray.com/jp/the_penguin.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonP">JasonP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464926/#Comment_464926" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-21T01:22:03+00:00" title="July 21, 2017  1:22AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1: The promise interpretation is correct.<br/><br/>2: Wirework is triggered by a knife exchange; the implicit demand here is, whatever demand was conveyed when the triggering knife exchange occurred. So for example if you walk into a McDonalds and say, \u201cI want thirty cheeseburgers,\u201d and hand the cashier the open knife, and they go to wirework, and you win, the demand is still \u201cgive (me) thirty cheeseburgers\u201d but the tables have turned, and you\u2019re the one who decides if you get those burgers or not.<br/><br/>3. After you\u2019ve defined a set, it\u2019s still \u201cyour set\u201d, you\u2019ve just said what the details are about it. It\u2019s in the middle of the table so people can see and use it.

And thanks, JP, for lending your account!<br/><br/>I think I understand it now. Awesome. So by taking the knife I get to decide the answer of the opponent. I can choose that they accept my demand. That's pretty cool and makes sense.<br/><br/>What tripped me up about the set cards was this sentence: "Blank set cards remain the property of each player until they are defined". That suggests they are no longer the property of the player once defined, thus not owned by the player. Just a thought if you ever revise the rule book.<br/><br/>Also, this makes me uncomfortable about taking a blank set card from a player! They can always take back a prop, but a defined set is mine forever and they will never be able to own a set in the game. Possibly this is me being squeamish, but I don't think I want to steal blank set cards in this game.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm looking forward to playing it, probably tomorrow!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464990/#Comment_464990" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-24T16:32:27+00:00" title="July 24, 2017  4:32PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Played the game, and it was really good! I hope to play it more in the future. One part still really threw us, though. Escalating to bloodied.<br/><br/>So you hand me the knife and ask me to do something, then I stab your sheet and ask you to do something, which if you accept will mean I also accept. The text implies that this means I'm also doing physical violence to you. This feels really weird! I'm having trouble imagining a situation where this makes sense. And it gets more difficult since you will die before the end of the scene. So I'm limited to asking things that you can accomplish right now.<br/><br/>An example of this mechanic in use would really clear it up. As it is, it always felt impossible to escalate from unsheathed, because it never made sense to (conditionally) agree to someone's demand and stab them at the same time.<br/><br/>The ultimatum is also a bit confusing, but we never got there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468823/#Comment_468823" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-11T18:53:47+00:00" title="January 11, 2018  6:53PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm running this game tomorrow and still have trouble with this. I hand you an open knife and say "Give me 30 cheeseburgers!" Then you stab my sheet and say "only if you give me 1000 dollars!" and \u2026 punch me in the face? So you punch me and ask me to give you 1000 dollars, and if I comply, you give me the hamburgers, but then I have to die before the end of the scene.<br/><br/>It feels really weird! Even ignoring the demand for violence, if I agree to your demand, then we both do things for each other, but then we have to make sure I die, somehow, anyway.<br/><br/>Can someone clarify this for me?
