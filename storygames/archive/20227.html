Although, I've kind of "Naturalized" the names to "Gamer Players, Story Players, and Sim Players."  I also have thought up a good analogy of how they are.  "Imagine a cowboy's revolver.  A sim player wants to know how many bullets are left, and wants to be sure the cowboy doesn't shoot 7 times without reloading.  A story player wants to know who's name is inscribed on the bullet, and why the cowboy wants to kill him. A gamer player wants to try and use the remaining bullets as effectively as possible."  <br/><br/>Anyways, I was just kind of curious if this is still part of other people's thoughts as much as it is mine.                  </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445860/#Comment_445860" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-01T05:15:31+00:00" title="July  1, 2015  5:15AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 1, 2015 5:18AM by Paul_T.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think you'll find consensus on this point. There are many here who find the idea very applicable and useful, and others who think it's fairly asinine.<br/><br/>I find it very useful, myself, although more as a general concept (knowing a specific game's Creative Agenda - "We try to impress the GM while trying to outdo each other in our depictions of Early 20's gangsters, with extra points if they are morally grey in way which is appropriate to the period" - and then building all elements of play towards supporting it) than as an exhaustive list of only three possible play goals. I think this is in line with Ron Edwards' conceptualization of this stuff: it's three general <i>families</i> of Creative Agenda, and we may find that there are more (or fewer) than three, as we learn more about roleplaying and expand its boundaries. Like all families, some members fit the mold and others hardly seem to belong there.<br/><br/>Note, however, that "GNS" is not, as you put it, a "player model". It is not intended to describe players and their priorities. It is, rather, a simplification of creative goals found by a group in a specific instance of playing a certain game. That's an important distinction. (Look at it as a "player model", and I'll quickly switch to the "fairly asinine" camp.)<br/><br/>Much like, say, pop-psych personality types, or studying historical periods ("The Dark Ages") or artistic movements ("Postmodern Hip-Hop"), this kind of thing can be useful as a shorthand when talking about things at a certain distance. Get "into the trenches" with your actual source material, and you quickly find that, more often than not, the full picture is much more nuanced and mixed-up than your model would presume. In the same way, with the Big Model, I find it useful from a certain removed perspective, but sometimes lacking when it comes to dealing with real people playing a real game: there are all kinds of details and ephemera which break expectations and conventions, and those come to the fore. Much like "historical eras" or artistic movements, the terms are far from meaningless and can make for useful discussion as well as a quick shorthand, but learn enough about the material and you see how the terms miss the real crux of the matter.<br/><br/>(Much like how learning that so-and-so was an Existentialist is useful when studying philosophers, but actually getting into that person's intimate letters to family may yield surprising information which breaks out of the scope of this constructed "box" the term "Existentialist" is supposed to describe.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445862/#Comment_445862" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-01T07:15:46+00:00" title="July  1, 2015  7:15AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm pretty much with Paul here - Creative Agenda is an essential analytic concept in how I understand the processes of gaming, but using it to label people is mostly useful in rather narrow conditions. <i>Some</i> people I know do actually fall neatly into GNS boxes (mostly in that they have anxiety issues or lack of talent or utter lack of interest for a single agenda mode while being good with the other two), but it's nowhere common enough to be a central feature of player profiling for me. Like, it's usually more important to me in player profiling whether a given player is "hard" or "soft" (as in, has grit and delights in adversity, or not) or whether they're "literate" or not, or whether they're "technical" or not, and as long as the game suits their general inclinations, chances are that they'll be game for any of the GNS modes (as long as the game itself is good).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445863/#Comment_445863" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-01T07:37:18+00:00" title="July  1, 2015  7:37AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More agreement here.

But, when developing CA theory, Ron &amp; others used names for categories which had already been used in discussing player types. Lots of confusion ensued.<br/><br/>I'm with everybody here in stating that Creative Agenda is an essential concept.<br/>I'll add my opinion that "GNS", or any specific broad labels for specific CAs, is not: that's the weakest part of the Big Model and, while essential in its historical development, I don't consider it relevant anymore (except in a few very specific circumstances I guess). I don't think it's really important, or even possible, to neatly categorize all possible CAs - what's important is understanding what a CA is, and (for a game-designer especially) having at least some firsthand experience of playing with different, explicitly negotiated CAs.<br/><br/>"Player types" are of no value whatsoever to me personally. I guess they might be, as a general concept, <i><b>if</b></i> the types in question were specifically tailored to <i>one</i> game in the context of <i>one</i> established CA. Thus, I believe the idea of categorizing players at least made sense in the context where it originally belonged: within one loosely defined culture of playing D&amp;D (but I assume those circumstances muddled everything up to the point of uselessness). Beyond that, across multiple games and CAs, I believe those to be as vapid as zodiac personalities or any other categorization of people: ultimately, I have to get to know each person as a unique individual, for they are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445866/#Comment_445866" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-01T09:15:37+00:00" title="July  1, 2015  9:15AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Has anyone heard of priming?

The original question was about whether GNS labels are being used as player types, not about whether GNS theory in general has some value.

The concept of Creative Agenda can create a paradigm shift in the way you look at playing a game. (And Ron's "bass player" analogy is a good one in this respect.)<br/><br/>A "traditional" (perhaps?) way of thinking about RPGs:<br/><br/>"This player is Type A, so they need X, while that one is Type B, so they need Y. The GM needs to provide jollies of Type X and Y, in a balanced recipe, to entertain the players and keep them happy."<br/><br/>(Noteworthy is the omission of "GM types": player types generally have to do with the non-GM players, whose demands/needs/wants must be "satisfied" by the GM.)<br/><br/>The Big Model's approach, rather, has nothing to do with player "types":<br/><br/>"This game is type A (having a specific Creative Agenda). Therefore, all players should strive to fulfill their roles in a way which augments and reinforces A (the Creative Agenda); making decisions in-play to stay focused on this particular game's creative goals."<br/><br/>Speaking purely for myself, I find the latter point of view to be much more fun and much more effective. I've enjoyed gaming a great deal more - and with much greater variety - once I started looking at it this way.<br/><br/>A musical analogy is apt here: in the first case, the musician joins a band with the attitude, "Hey, I really enjoy music which is loud!" And then it's the responsibility of someone in charge to give them what they like. In the second case, the musician considers the group and the piece or song being played, and tries to add something which enhances the whole.<br/><br/>For me, this attitude (especially when all the players in the game embrace it) has led to much more fun gaming (and more consistently). Whether I'm the GM or player, I'm looking to build upon what's happening at the table and make moves which enhance (or challenge, if it's that kind of game) what the other players are doing.<br/><br/>It's about figuring out what makes a particular group and game really shine, and focusing in on that. When everyone at a table does that... magic happens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445931/#Comment_445931" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-03T18:12:09+00:00" title="July  3, 2015  6:12PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to disagree that what Paul_T says has application beyond personal, subjective preference. <br/><br/>While that may arguably arrive at something optimal for the game, if what the game does isn't optimal for the players involved then what was the point?<br/><br/>To go back to your music analogy: Let's say the musician is highly skilled, and fully commits to enhancing the whole, which he does, earning the group a Grammy. However, upon reflection he sees that he is not happy playing that way, regardless of accolades, so he quits the group and starts a screamcore group. In that he never receives a bit of praise, but loves what he does and is truly happy. So at what point was he most successful?<br/><br/>It doesn't matter rather the game shines, it matters rather the players are satisfied by the experience. Some will be fulfilled doing what you enjoy, but others will not. For them, they need a game which reflects their own preferences. <br/><br/>In fact, if you look at the broad picture, your enjoyment is achieved by focusing on player type (in this case, you are a game enhancer, and so are fulfilled by engaging in this), but others won't be by focusing on game enhancing in lieu of their type. This seems to grant superiority of design to type sorting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445932/#Comment_445932" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-03T18:39:58+00:00" title="July  3, 2015  6:39PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2015 6:56PM by Paul_T.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">@phoenix182</a>,<br/><br/>You've pretty much got the gist of it, yes.<br/><br/>Your musician analogy is a bit misleading, because "fame" and making money (both potentially good reasons to stay with the Grammy-winning band) don't, as far as I can tell, have any application in the gaming world. Take those out of the picture, and why would you stay with that band? What's the point? Of *course* he is better of with his screamcore group, and that's where he should stay. Not much of a difficult question, really.<br/><br/>Now, if you're that musician with the Grammy-nominated group, and feeling unhappy, what should you do? <br/><br/>I'd say that it would be worth finding whether they share your interests. Maybe the other band members also want more of whatever it is you're looking for? Then you can all groove on whatever that is together. But, if they don't, I can't see any great benefit to forcing it into this band, where it's not particularly welcome, but would be added into the mix just to fulfill your personal preferences.<br/><br/>I think it's pretty well-known that the Forge approach to achieving the pursuit of happiness as a gamer was to a) embrace a great variety in game design and play cultures, and b) encourage people to choose the games they play intelligently: if it's fun for you, play it... if it's not, play a different game (or with different people).<br/><br/>This is quite a contrast to the more "traditional" mindset, which often held the assumption that there was one monolithic game or activity which was "roleplaying", and it had to fulfill all needs and desires.<br/><br/>It's certainly not illogical to seek a single game and a single group which fulfills all the needs of each player. It's maybe even a worthy goal. <br/><br/>I'm only talking of my personal experience when I say, however, that the latter approach did not contribute to my enjoyment of gaming as much as the former. We don't seek one movie to fulfill all our film-watching desires: rather, we enjoy a variety of comedies, tragedies, dramas, action films, and documentaries. We don't expect one musical group to suit all occasions or all moods - rather, we enjoy a variety of bands, styles, and musical traditions.<br/><br/>As far as I know, Hollywood doesn't try to put together "the world's best musical group" and "world's best film composer" and then use them to record the soundtrack to every film they make. (Which would probably be much more efficient than contracting each soundtrack separately.) Rather, they try to match each soundtrack to each film as appropriately as possible, to highlight the qualities of that particular picture. Sometimes you need a string orchestra and sometimes some Top 40's dance hits will be a better match.<br/><br/>Would it make for better films if Hollywood producers used this kind of logic? "Hey, our last action flick didn't resonate well with the American stay-at-home-mom crowd. We'd better add Johnny Depp and Oprah to the next one... but also make sure to include lots of raunchy humour for our younger viewers, and a bit of historical commentary for the older crowd interested in learning about period events. There, now our movies will be much better!"<br/><br/>Certainly you could argue that movies <i>should</i> be made this way. Wouldn't the ultimate film be equally interesting for everyone? I suspect there's a reason pleasing every possible audience within the scope of any particular film isn't the way things are done, however...<br/><br/>I see no reason for gaming to be different. Sometimes you want immersive wish-fulfillment fantasy with a group of players who are capable of creating Tolkienesque epics, and sometimes you like to play a tactical science fiction battle with a bunch of rowdy, hilarious punks.  <br/><br/>But to each his own! I just haven't, myself, ever gotten far with this approach, whereas trying to make each game as fun and engaging as possible (and then gracefully bowing out if it's not my cup of tea) has improved my gaming life tremendously. Perhaps your experience, dear reader, is the opposite.<br/><br/>That's fine. I just no longer try to bring my wish-fulfillment epic fantasy mindset to the slapstick-loving sci-fi punks - it doesn't improve the game for anybody. (Myself included.)<br/><br/>I don't think any of this is news to anybody - the concept has been around for a long time - but I do think it's an interesting part of the legacy of the Forge. This mindset was promoted there and has now become a way to approach gaming for a lot of people, who seem to have benefited from it quite a lot in terms of being able to find and enjoy games which fulfill them.<br/><br/>I think that's a big part of how the "GNS" (or, rather, the concept of Creative Agenda, which can be useful even if you don't agree that G, N, and S are sensible categories) has influenced gamers and the gaming scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445934/#Comment_445934" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-03T19:18:43+00:00" title="July  3, 2015  7:18PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's been a few months since we had our latest discussion about this model here.<br/>However, my opinion has changed.

(I'm not saying the original threefold is very useful in our post-Forge world, but it was VERY applicable to the state of the art circa Theatrix/Everway/Over the Edge, more applicable than the mish-mash of interpretations of GNS have ever been as far as I can tell.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>If we take <i>one</i> persons take on which actions/groups/games/players/choices/priorities fall into which GNS category, it perhaps make sense.

If you dodge confusion on that point, there's a high probability you're in the clear for CA clash.<br/><br/>Not that I'm convinced CA clash is all that prevalent.<br/><br/>I spent a long time trying to understand Ron Edwards' specific formulations of G and N and S, not to use as truth, but to use as fixed reference points for discussion.  Sadly, it's only just sunk in for me just how much Ron was blending his own takes with other people's as part of a discussion that had already been going on for a long time, with no fixed positions ever being established.  Ron was eager to tell me Sim was one thing in 2008, another thing in 2011, and possibly not anything at all earlier this year (and that those 3 things were perfectly mutually compatible, of course).<br/><br/>My latest observation is that some folks who care about Creative Agenda can't tell (or at least agree on) whether a lot of roleplay has it or not.  There's a chaotic space where "just roleplaying" and "exploration as creative drive" and "constructive denial" and "aesthetic goals" and "this is hard to diagnose and there's no fixed protocol for doing so" meet.  There's a little really clear Gamist play out there, and a little really clear Narrativist play, and a whole giant universe of "no one's gonna agree on what's going on here."<br/><br/>I am one of the many suckers who got drawn into the compulsion to really nail down GNS scientifically, and the vexation of so much incomplete communication from my efforts still gnaws at me from time to time.  I think GNS has a sort of cult-like lure, with its controversial history and polarizing proponents and hard-to-prove (and thus easy to opine about and fight over) manifestations and arcane language and intellectual challenge and promise of being somehow involved with the effort to make games of great value.  <br/><br/>My take now is this: <b>Be clear about why people would want to play your game.</b>  If you do that, you're set.  If CA or GNS can help you formulate that, great.  If you don't need them, ignore them.  If you need <i>something</i>, but CA/GNS isn't helping, look elsewhere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446119/#Comment_446119" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-10T18:53:55+00:00" title="July 10, 2015  6:53PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've put far less effort into understanding GNS and Forge theory than David Berg, but my experiences are broadly similar in character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446120/#Comment_446120" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-10T19:19:43+00:00" title="July 10, 2015  7:19PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>My take now is this: <b>Be clear about why people would want to play your game.</b>  If you do that, you're set.

Is that right? (If so, you're clearly not alone.)<br/><br/>I already expressed my take on this, above: I find the categories (although I do see them as very loose categories, with lots of overlap, and so forth) very useful from a theoretical standpoint, but less so "in the trenches", where things rarely fit a theoretical ideal.<br/><br/>(And, of course, the whole Right to Dream concept covers things which seem so unrelated as to be completely different hobbies: just compare an immersionist LARP to playing something like Microscope.)<br/><br/>I suppose the main issue <i>I</i> see with applying the model is that very few actual, real-life games fit neatly into one of three boxes. There may be a player who is not on board with what the others are doing, a game system which doesn't align with the group's agenda, several people coming to the table with different interests (e.g. that friend who likes to crack jokes and hang out), and many other factors. Trying to apply one of three distinct Agendas becomes a pretty moot prospect at that point. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, I've found thinking along these lines incredibly useful and, often, practical (particularly when it comes to GMing, game design, or what feature I should pick for my character).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446131/#Comment_446131" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-11T06:11:38+00:00" title="July 11, 2015  6:11AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 11, 2015 6:21AM by AsIf.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agree w Paul, but I'm of the Horseshoe Model camp.

This is what makes for a <b>coherent</b> game.<br/><br/>(I often visualize Vampire Masquerade, for example, with me in the middle and a horse tied to my limbs and each one pulling in a different direction ... ouch!)<br/><br/>What is NOT important, and is instead the core of 90% of the flames around CA, is to specifically identify and label this "direction thing".<br/><b>It doesn't matter</b> if your game idea is going North or South, or if it is Nar or Sim or Glam or P0rn or whatever... it matters that you LOOK for a direction and then you work to have everything go more or less in that same nameless direction.<br/><br/>Of course it helps to know what that direction is, but instead of an abstract label or category that never quite fits what you had in mind, I find INFINITELY MORE useful to actually describe in practical at-the-table terms how the game experience you have in mind should look and feel like.<br/><br/>So the concept of CA in crucial for good, coherent, design. While the actual identification and labelling and <b>horoscoping</b> of specific CAs is largely irrelevant, and in my experience actually harmful to both the design of games and the discussion around them :P<br/><br/>Does anybody else feel this way? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446144/#Comment_446144" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-11T10:58:07+00:00" title="July 11, 2015 10:58AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hasimir - yes, my views now are very similar.

GNS theory agrees as well, insofar as it lays no claim to "horoscoping" (I like that simile) having any special value per se. If you're designing with a cohesive creative agenda, everything is going well, and it does not actually matter for the success of your creative goals as to which agenda mode your game and creative agenda might ultimately eventuate.<br/><br/>Putting aside people's limitless curiousity towards labeling things and nit-picking the definitions of those labels, GNS theory basically puts forward just one substantial, falsifiable and actionable claim about gaming: given a group of players trying to play together, if the creative agendas they are trying to fulfill fall into different agenda modes, the game <i>will</i> incohere creatively. I guess the emphasis on the underbrush of terminological definition arises out of difficulties with understanding and applying the agenda modes; if you don't understand what Sim is, then you won't recognize it when you see it, and that'll certainly make it somewhat difficult to do GNS analysis on given practical play experiences.<br/><br/>Still, for game <i>design</i> purposes the above concerns are irrelevant. Historically GNS has been relevant to game designers because of the majestic picture it paints of the variety of possibilities in roleplaying; you design differently when you realize that your <i>first</i> task is to nail down your creative agenda, support it and communicate it effectively to the reader of your game text, rather than blithely assuming that you should support each and every impulse that's ever crossed the game table. Besides inspiration, though, nobody designs by first deciding what agenda mode their game is supposed to support, and then doing, I don't know, copy-paste out of the standard Gamism manual for the bare bones of their game or something - that's simply not something we do. GNS does not talk to design, even if the Big Model does.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446148/#Comment_446148" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-11T16:33:28+00:00" title="July 11, 2015  4:33PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hasimir I agree!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446151/#Comment_446151" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-11T18:25:20+00:00" title="July 11, 2015  6:25PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with Hasimir, as well.

There are infinite possible *specific* CAs, and each has its own flavour.)<br/><br/>There are three vague families of Creative Agendas, but ultimately each game and group is unique. This really clicked for me when I read Ron describing his own games, and his descriptions were often of some kind of mixture of the three CAs: "This D&amp;D game was basically vanilla narrativism, with a fringe of competition over which of us could come up with the character build most suited to distorting a typical D&amp;D trope..."<br/><br/>The key is to figure out where the game is going and to support that.<br/><br/>And, of course, some people seem to appreciate and value "incoherent" play, particularly when they're more interested in hanging out and cracking jokes or rolling dice or really focused on a certain Technical Agenda (e.g. I love painting miniatures! I just want an excuse to show them off to my friends! Beyond that it's just fun hanging out, so I'll play whatever). I'm not sure what to say about that, basically some people really, really love it, but I've never found that kind of thing terribly satisfying myself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446152/#Comment_446152" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-11T18:46:19+00:00" title="July 11, 2015  6:46PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You aren't taking the theory's analysis seriously enough - and this is a common fallback position when anyone points out how discredited the whole thing is.

Players that show up to play with friends may be playing coherently or incoherently or neither.<br/><br/>Remember that according to the theory, overwhelmingly, RPG play is incoherent and that's why (again, according to the theory), overwhelmingly, RPG players are dissatisfied and unhappy.  Since even a quick glance around the hobby shows they aren't, some work overtime to say "Well, that must mean they're coherent and we just can't see how", thereby saving the theory.

There's certainly the implication that incoherent games can be fun but won't ever become Truly Awesome (or maybe it's even stated outright? I'm not sure). But that fits with my own experiences, so I've never had much of a beef with it.<br/><br/>As for the other side of it - non-fun incoherent gaming - I don't know what to tell you. I've seen it and I've done it, and in all the cases I've experienced nailing down a more concrete Creative Agenda and driving towards (whether in explicit terms or not) improved the game <i>dramatically</i>.

Let's kill them all!") or overly zealous Forge folks saying stupid stuff (e.g. Ron's infamous "brain damage" statements; possibly the video linked above by Sandra).<br/></blockquote>\nIf that means I'm actually *disagreeing* with "the theory", in your eyes, I can't prove you wrong. If I have an unusually positive interpretation of the theory, in other words, and that disagrees with the "canon", then I'm happy to be "wrong". <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446154/#Comment_446154" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-11T19:08:24+00:00" title="July 11, 2015  7:08PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 11, 2015 7:09PM by 2097.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Since even a quick glance around the hobby shows they aren't,</blockquote>\nGotta disagree with this!

That essay is not the be-all, end-all of GNS theory; Ron couldn't know it at the time, but it was merely the starting point for a dialogue that is still on-going. Probably nobody today underwrites everything in that article as being part of their own GNS theory.<br/><br/>Of course this observation raises the question as to how one goes about discovering what the theory actually says. For my druthers this is a misleading question rooted in a flawed epistemology, as it assumes that there is a coherent theory with an authoritative text to be queried where this is not necessarily the case. The GNS theory has evolved overwhelmingly in the form of dialogues with varied participation, and there is to my knowledge no "final" text for it that would be underwritten by anybody. Ron is something of a GNS pope (it being originally his theory), but even he hasn't put down anything very comprehensive or final on the matter. In this regard asking what the GNS theory says is like asking what e.g. Christianity or Communism says: you can at best answer for a fixed point in time. You cannot, however, make yourself the pope who decides that GNS says and what it doesn't say.<br/><br/>This unfortunate circumstance of course makes it difficult to debate GNS theory if you insist on doing it as outsiders talking about what some third party thinks. If Jason insists on debating the Ron Edwards of 2002 while e.g. Paul presents his own current understanding, then of course you'll find that the two arguments simply do not connect: Paul can always disclaim the stupid bits in the scriptures Jason quotes, and stick to the truths he finds evident. This is, of course, very similar to the stupid debates you get when an atheist gleefully quotes the stupidest bits of the Bible at a Christian for whom those particular bits might hold no significance whatsoever as part of their personal worldview <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Hmm, maybe we should start a new thread for talking about what GNS theory says and doesn't say. It is an interesting question, and people aren't often very certain about it, as can be seen in Paul's off-hand claim about GNS agenda mixing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446161/#Comment_446161" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-11T22:51:27+00:00" title="July 11, 2015 10:51PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 11, 2015 10:55PM by Hasimir.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A game with coherent rules HELPS the participants to have a FUNCTIONAL game experience (aka... when we all play with the same overall goals and values in mind, when we think "good game! good move!" of each other).<br/><br/>Still, for a thousand and one reasons, the actual game experience can end up being DYSFUNCTIONAL (aka... when my game-actions hinder other's fun and vice versa, when you think someone is a powerplayer or a rule-lawyer or an attention whore, a diva, a drama queen, etc and you are NOT ok with it).<br/><br/>By the same token a game with incoherent rules HINDERS the ability of participants of achieving FUNCTIONAL play.

Hasimir, your statement of what the theory says is indeed a design standard, and I think you correctly lay it out.  <br/><br/>Now, some didn't agree when incoherent design was accused of being <i>intentionally</i> damaging - to be put in the same category as a hitting someone in the head with a claw hammer.  That's true.  I don't necessarily think it's fair to say that idea persisted in GNS thinking over time (though there was a time when it was quite prevalent.)<br/><br/>But if anyone said said "hey, incoherent design is a good thing because it lets groups be flexible and do different things at different points depending on their own aesthetic preferences, which may shift over time" they were not considered to be advancing a new design standard completely in line with GNS theory. The reason isn't because they've misapprehended what coherency or Creative Agenda is, but instead because they reject the design standard advanced by GNS.  It's a prescriptive theory, straight up.<br/><br/>Another way to put it: When anyone made the argument that maybe the first thirty years of RPG design wasn't a weight tied around the ankle of happiness and fun which had to be ~overcome~ to be truly satisfying, that argument was considered to be an argument against GNS. I think that view of it is correct.  It's not my fault that the GNS side comes out looking so bad in this exchange.

At the very most positive I saw people wondering about whether it could be value-neutral to the experience of play, but that was definitely a fringe view.<br/><br/>I also agree that Forgite community as a whole was and is pretty prescriptive about encouraging coherent game design, although I have to say that exploring alternatives was never discouraged if one should believe in such. A remarkable example is <i>Capes</i>, the creator of which, Tony, still maintains as far as I know that he created a true bi-modal Gam/Nar game. I've never seen anybody Forge-related critique the game for the creator not hewing to the orthodoxy or anything like that.<br/><br/>I would quibble that it was not "GNS theory" saying that design coherence is the best way to go about things, though - it's just a theory about the reasons of agenda incohesion, it doesn't hold value judgements the way the theorist community as a whole might. I decided to compose a post about what the GNS theory actually says, so I'll come back to this point later (in a new thread, this one's a bit unfocused for an in-depth analysis).<br/><br/>It is in fact interesting how little in the way of design theory the Forge produced. The biggest holy cow in this regard is probably independent creator ownership rather than anything to do with game theory.<br/><br/>As for the argument that gaming was just fine before the Forge came along, my experience at the Forge (starting in 2003 or so - I was not an active participant initially, although I did read it from the start) was that us, the people most attracted to it, shared a relatively negative and disappointed perspective on traditional games and their ability to actually help us have fun in gaming. I don't remember active refusal or debate of prior art having been a large part of the discussion, largely because we all already agreed rather wordlessly on our disinterest towards the traditional ways. A certain degree of simplification was present when discussing trad games for brevity and clarity - it is easier to talk about what to do differently if you emphasize the differences rather than attempting to maintain a constant nuanced appreciation for the complexity of cultural history.<br/><br/>That is to say, I don't disagree if you say that the Forge community generally held that traditional gaming could be better; some individuals no doubt held harder views, such as my own disappointment at the incohesive traditionalism of the mainstream. I've always taken this attitude more in the nature of personal testimony than as some sort of claim that all trad gaming is incoherent and evil and bad. I myself, for example, held in 2004 (to pick an arbitrary date around when I was playing 3rd ed. D&amp;D) that the text of the game was sadly deficient, but that if somebody could play a successful game with it, all the more power to them. I don't remember thinking that everybody not playing an approved Forge game would by definition have to be playing incoherently and therefore badly; I do remember thinking that incoherent play is by definition unsatisfying and "bad" in quality, which is a position I hold to this day.<br/><br/>In summation: I think that much play in the history of roleplaying has been pretty coherent, some has been highly coherent, but that game texts in general have not been as supportive of this as they could be, which has left it largely for the local culture of play to maintain and support cohesion in the ways we all know. This was not in any way an aberrant view at the Forge last decade, or if it was, I've managed to conveniently forget it since then <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446168/#Comment_446168" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-12T01:32:18+00:00" title="July 12, 2015  1:32AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I did as I threatened, and wrote up my understanding of what the GNS theory actually says in <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20253/" rel="nofollow">a new thread</a>.

This idea has become increasingly relevant to me over the last couple years, as I've grown unfortunately alienated from the NYC indie scene. No one's doing anything wrong, but the scene seems to be moving more and more towards everything being as mechanically light and freeform as possible\u2014the designs are still excellent, don't get me wrong. I just really crave being able to manipulate the fiction via clever applications of mechanics.<br/><br/>But it also helps explain why, for example, many people who are alienated with traditional gaming and crave certain things well-supported by the Forge/post-Forge diaspora games, nevertheless can't handle, say, Burning Wheel. They may be totally on board with what the game does as a creative matter, but simply don't enjoy the rigorous mechanics and the mastery of them that the game demands in order to function. Or they dislike the transparency of the lower-case-a agenda setting brought by Beliefs. Whatever the case may be, TA interferes with people's ability to really get on board with a game just as much as CA.<br/><br/>It flows the other way too! Many indie people won't play trad games even if the themes of those games are deeply appealing. I mean, I'll play Monsterhearts, but I won't touch Vampire. I wouldn't even touch Vampire if a particular campaign was set at a high school and had other setting similarities to MH.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446177/#Comment_446177" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-12T04:02:26+00:00" title="July 12, 2015  4:02AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>GNS has proven really attractive to those that have your experience, but if that's what it turns on, whether RPG players are having fun or not, then we'll need to hire some sociologists to figure that out for us.

And I made many specific design decisions while writing it initially based on my understanding of what Sim means. I've tested it many times and the rules are fine; it does need a complete <i>text</i>, art, etc., so we'll see if I ever publish it. :-) But my point is that it absolutely is possible to use the idea of a particular CA to help in game design.<br/><br/>Of course, as others have said, even if I'm correct, the game I wrote still only supports one <i>flavor</i> of Sim.<br/><br/>Hmm...<br/><br/>Thinking about it more, I've concluded that Sim is the *least* well-understood of the three simply due to the prevalence of <b>a desire to simulate</b> in much traditional design (including in GURPS, which Ron cited in the original Sim essay). The reason this connection is flawed is because the degree to which a game's rules attempt to model, say, realistic swordfighting is completely irrelevant to the question of <i>creative</i> agenda.<br/><br/>Like, if the thing the game wants me to do is use the system to model a convincing swordfight in the real-world, and to accept that, e.g., the underdog probably won't win and that it doesn't matter if your character really has a lot on the line or you spent 2 hours making him, then, maybe, I'd accept that you're playing Sim.

That is, designing a game with <i>any</i> kind of theory helps the design cohere around a common structure, even if the theory is something bizarre, like actual alchemy. Of course, I've used this more for informing the <i>content</i> of the game then thinking about its goals, but I think the principle still applies: how useful a theory is in designing a game has a weak relation to how universally applicable it is.<br/><br/>If the theory makes sense to you and it helps you design better games, I think that's a good thing. (Which, upon rereading the thread, is close to something Hasimir and Rob_Alexander said above.) In fact, having a theory can be a critical driver of better design. I'd just argue that you can't use successful design as direct, inductive proof that the theory is absolutely true. (Not that you were, but you get my drift.) Indirect evidence, sure. Universal truth?

I think it would be fair to say that the methodological traditions fractured very early: the game texts certainly do not support much in the way of transmission (that is, the early texts for the most part aren't incisive enough to transmit an entire playstyle, they assume that you already know what you're going to do with the rules), and while there was some movement of gamers around the United States during the '70s, it seems pretty much a given to me that the roots of the rpg discussion culture emerging in the '80s are in several hundred cargo cults all over the country as much or more so as they are in the texts or direct lineal transmission.<br/><br/>This was also the case in Finland when I started gaming in the early '90s; our group learned by trial and error, based on the texts for e.g. Runequest, Cyberpunk 2020, Paranoia, MERP and other such '80 trad games. (Many Finns learned from Mentzer, but that was not the case with us - never saw that one before I was already initiated in other ways.) Unified understanding has only come in slowly with the Internet facilitating deep long-term discourses, more than anything else.<br/><br/>To me the Threefold discussions seem like the same kind of discussions we always get about the nature of roleplaying: people with widely differing play backgrounds struggling to understand each other, armed with some shared game texts and lots of unspoken assumptions <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446226/#Comment_446226" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-12T18:30:22+00:00" title="July 12, 2015  6:30PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Even within game lines instructions changed - this is a result of a culture that pursued game lines instead of game designers.

Not all of them, but it seems like a common path to starting to design things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446231/#Comment_446231" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-12T21:26:51+00:00" title="July 12, 2015  9:26PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Immersion as a CA type?</b><br/><br/>Some people definitely play RPGs for the purpose of immersing.  Whether that's an agenda the way "let's roleplay" or "story now" or "I prefer hit points" each is an agenda, I'm sure no one will agree on.<br/><br/>If you want to make the case for it being a "story now" level of agenda, I think you have to put the focus on character of experience, and how the GM and player inputs are valued depending on how they contribute to that experience.<br/><br/>One can then easily lump that into Sim, but only the "so broad it's problematic" version of Sim.<br/><br/>I'm tempted to enumerate all the "reasons to play" which one could claim are "just roleplaying", so as to illustrate the multitudes lumped within too-broad-Sim, but I have no idea how to compare those to the varieties of Gam and Nar.  If the only takeaway is going to be "G and N and S are each really broad", there's probably no point.<br/><br/><b>What the Big Model says</b><br/><br/>Long after most of the key articles were posted on the Forge, Ron was in the habit of referring people to read things he'd more recently said in various threads, as better or more complete or usefully applied updates.  Accordingly, any reader's understanding of "what the Big Model says" depends on which Ron quotes they've clicked on.<br/><br/>I suspect that many people who strongly disagree on what the Big Model says are all correct based on what they've been led to believe.  A lot of the questions recently posed in this thread re: prescription really just depend on whether you caught Ron in a "live and let live" mood or a "judgmental tirade" mood.<br/><br/><b>Theory for the discontented?</b><br/><br/>My interest in theory has only ever been from the combo of John Kim's 2 options above.  I care because I both love RPG play and also want to change it.  Theory is a way of finding questions and pursuing answers re: how to put my own, unique, even-more-awesome-to-me spin on something I think is awesome already.  It's like being a painter who reads about painting (how-to's, analyses of why great paintings are great and how bad paintings went wrong, etc.) in hopes of becoming a better painter.<br/><br/>Theory is certainly not as good an approach to this goal as practice, but it can supplement practice, and in the absence of opportunities for practice it's often better than nothing.<br/><br/>So, yeah, if you're <i>completely</i> content then you have no need for theory.  And if you already know how to get what you want out of practice then you probably have no need for theory.  Otherwise, hey, could be worth a peek!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446232/#Comment_446232" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-12T21:36:15+00:00" title="July 12, 2015  9:36PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 12, 2015 9:41PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The important / desirable bit is to have all rules contribute to <i>the same overall direction</i> . . .

The (most legitimate, to me) reason why many persist in the effort is the perception that (1) each label actually signifies something important, and (2) it's easy to miss those important things if you aren't looking for them, and think you have a coherent direction when actually you don't.  <br/><br/>I'm not sure what I think on this front (when do the labels help?), but I definitely think that the direction of a traditional RPG is a vastly more complicated issue than the direction of a typical board game.  The idea that designers could benefit from some reminders or checklists or whatever on the coherence front does make sense to me, though I suspect the main GNS contribution here is limited (e.g. "are we playing to win or aren't we?").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446235/#Comment_446235" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-12T23:04:33+00:00" title="July 12, 2015 11:04PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave,<br/><br/>While I agree that Step On Up presents a very clearly formulated "agenda", and the Right to Dream potentially lumps together all kinds of different activities (or, at least, is hard to define), you're also implying that Story Now is a vague and undefined area of creative interest.

We ignore the rules when they get in the way of story, and all we want to do is focus on the fictional events. Not rolling the dice too often is part of this, as are rules which allow players to narrate anything they like during the game: we want to be free to tell exactly the story we want! (Or to tell exactly the story that the GM wants, in some cases, like a pre-scripted adventure.)<br/><br/>S stands for Simulationism.<br/><br/>Simulationism is all about modeling a fictional universe as accurately as possible, and playing to "find out" what would happen in certain hypothetical situations. We play to explore possible situations and then use a set of rules as the "physics of the gameworld" to determine what would happen next.

I refer to it sometimes as "What if?" play, myself.<br/><br/>Your definition lines up pretty well with Threefold Sim, I think (not an expert). However, it is only a very small part of Big Model Sim (which was eventually renamed "Right to Dream" precisely to avoid this kind of confusion, although it was clearly much too late). In Forge terms, it's more about Technical Agenda than about Creative Agenda: although it makes it likely that you'll be playing Right to Dream, that description, by itself, is much more about your toolkit than it is about *why* you're playing the game you're playing. It wouldn't be impossible at all to use those some tools to play with a Step On Up agenda or a Story Now agenda (although that one would probably be more difficult).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446312/#Comment_446312" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-13T07:44:58+00:00" title="July 13, 2015  7:44AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Frobnication is always a "to-be-replaced" term for me.

Creative Agenda is about *why* we enjoy doing something, or what we hope to get out of it. Technical Agenda, in this formulation, is *how* we like to achieve that, what tools we like to use.<br/><br/>Some people don't seem to care too much about Technical Agenda, and other people seem to feel so strongly about it that it, alone, is enough to get them to play (or not play) a game, other details might as well not exist. <br/><br/>A long time ago, Ben Lehman wrote:\n<blockquote><br/>There seems to be great confusion about the use of the term Simulationism. To paraphrase Vincent, a lot of people want the word to mean something that is cooler than it is. Further, most of these people seem to talk about it in terms of a set of techniques for enhancing the "reality" of the experience.<br/><br/>I'd like to propose that there exists a set set of techniques, compatible with any creative agenda which encompasses what these people are talking about when they say "simulationism."<br/><br/>I'd like to propose calling these techniques "plausibility techniques" as a whole, with the subsets of "fidelity techniques" and "immersion techniques." The essential idea is that the goal is to render a plausible gameworld, and that this is achieved via two means: One is rules which make the game adhere to certain requirements, the other is an immersion which brings players into a trance-state where they will accept the strangeness of the world as reasonable and true.<br/><br/>Those two subsets are not the entireity of plausibility techniques -- there are other types, I'm sure.</blockquote>\nThat seems relevant here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446317/#Comment_446317" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-13T08:37:39+00:00" title="July 13, 2015  8:37AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 13, 2015 8:38AM by 2097.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Coming dangerously close to a semantics trap, sometimes the "how" can be the "why".

After all, if your "why" for playing this game is to see how it compares to something else, you haven't decided yet whether it fulfills your creative needs or not: you will make that deliberation only *after* you have played. <br/><br/>In other words, playing to test a concept may be an agenda which drives you to try a certain thing, but it won't be the metric by which you decide whether you really *enjoy* that, and whether you want to repeat it in the future; whether it suits your creative goals.<br/><br/>I like Full Myth, and agree that it probably makes quite a lot of sense to someone familiar with Forge jargon.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446321/#Comment_446321" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-13T09:20:52+00:00" title="July 13, 2015  9:20AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 13, 2015 10:08AM by 2097.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, so far, my experiences with Full Myth have been both like "Oh yeah, this, this is it, I am <em>home</em>, I want to play like this always" and also like "Oy... so much prep to do as DM...

Of course, using pre-existing modules is another, although it seems to me that doesn't save as much time as you would think, since reading through the material could take as long as coming up with it yourself! A final solution is to carefully figure out the minimal number of highly-important elements which make your game exciting and learn to limit yourself to those. Dogs in the Vineyard Towns are a good example: you've got everything you need to play in a fairly quick "package", so that all the prep is as close as possible to 100% relevant in the actual game session.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446323/#Comment_446323" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-13T10:08:05+00:00" title="July 13, 2015 10:08AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had great success with shorter modules (Lost Mine of Phandelver, B4 The Lost City) but feel like I'm getting burnt by bigger books (The Adventurer's Guide to Zakhara, Princes of the Apocalypse).<br/><br/>I need to read DitV.

I think the point about "creative fulfillment determined after" is universal; you can't know for sure how a session will go until you play it.  But I think there are other potential "why"s which are much closer to "how"s as per Sandra's point about the semantic trap.  The first thing that comes to mind is Immersive/Experientialist play, where the "why" is to persist in a state of transportation from real life into an engaging imagined space, with certain aesthetic goals for the style and character of both the transportation and the imagined space.

So, to address a recent post, \n<blockquote>Coming dangerously close to a semantics trap, sometimes the "how" can be the "why". I want to play Full Myth because I am interested in exploring Full Myth experiences and in finding out how they compare to No Myth experiences. That's a TA-level "why".<br/><br/>I'm coming around to "Full Myth" as a term, concept, and goal. It should be understandable enough to Big Model folks.<br/>I mean by it a prepared and populated <em>place</em>, not a prepared sequence of events.<br/>Where "No Myth" is of course the familiar "laying the tracks just ahead of the train as the train speeds on" type of improvised play.</blockquote>\nAs a summary, <br/><br/>"No Myth" play is more like acting improv games, where nothing is defined in advance, and the group draws the map as they go along.  "Full Myth" play is where the game-world is fully mapped and for every event, the GM consults his notes for what is present - such as a predefined "sandbox" that the GM has prepared where the players can do whatever they want within the bounds. <br/><br/>GNS theory divides things into <br/><br/>1) GNS Creative Agenda - such as Gamist, Narrativist, and Simulationist - that it posits as more fundamental motivations that constitute <b>why</b> people play. <br/><br/>2) Technical agenda (that 2097 calls "TA-level why") is supposedly preferences for <b>how</b> players approach the fundamental motivations of play, such as a preference for science fiction over fantasy, or no myth improv over full myth sandbox. <br/><br/>I agree that this how and why aren't clearly differentiated.  In particular, I don't think that creative agenda is a real motivation for people. People are motivated by real world results, not fiction. As I suggested in another thread, this could be things like stress relief, forming social bonds, emotional catharsis, and so forth.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446364/#Comment_446364" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-13T17:27:37+00:00" title="July 13, 2015  5:27PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 13, 2015 5:29PM by Adam_Dray.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I disagree that Creative Agenda is "why people play." All of Ron's Big Model stuff draws heavily from his behaviorist science training. The theory talks about observable things and events. When push comes to shove, in the case of CA, it's talking about /the things that are to be done/ (AGENDA, in the Latin sense), not some idealized notion of what a player wants. More than that, the way I saw Ron use it over and over, was as a general gist of the /shared priority/ of an entire group of players over a session or more of play.<br/><br/>So to say CA is "why people play" might be a useful shorthand to help people get to an understanding of the original intent, but I don't think it's terribly accurate or useful. <br/><br/>The definition I tend to use is something like this:\n<blockquote><br/>Creative Agenda is a group's primary priority of what's cool or desirable in play, reinforced and validated by the group over a reasonable length of actual play that touches on all the major parts of the system.<br/></blockquote>\nTechnical Agenda (in my mind, but not necessarily anyone else's) is the set of Techniques to make that play happen. I think it's useful to use in the same sense as CA, looking back at play for diagnosis, and less useful (maybe even dangerous, in the "will cause countless arguments" sense) to use it as a player preference thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446367/#Comment_446367" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-13T18:13:06+00:00" title="July 13, 2015  6:13PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Creative Agenda is a group's primary priority of what's cool or desirable in play, reinforced and validated by the group over a reasonable length of actual play that touches on all the major parts of the system.<br/><br/>Technical Agenda (in my mind, but not necessarily anyone else's) is the set of Techniques to make that play happen.

That's a design agenda.<br/><br/>Even "We want to learn about Korean culture" isn't a creative agenda. It's just a goal, maybe in the Social Contract layer of the Model, and a group of players might go at that goal with a Right to Dream agenda, or a Story Now agenda, or whatever.<br/><br/>To be a creative agenda, it has to be something that guides a player's creative input into the fiction (into the "shared imagined space," in Big Model parlance). I don't think "we want to learn about Korean culture" is a primary guide for creative input during play. <br/><br/>I don't think it's useful to tangle Creative Agenda and Techniques in this way, to say that a CA can be a Technique. CA /by definition/ is a spear that touches every layer of the Model, so if your definition of CA lets it be a Technique, then it's not the same definition as the Big Model's. Which is fine, but it's its own thing then.<br/><br/>This is all just a long way of saying, there are goals that are in the Social Contract layer that are not creative agenda goals, and I think your example showcases this.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446388/#Comment_446388" name="Item_113" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-13T20:32:17+00:00" title="July 13, 2015  8:32PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam, right... it's not a CA but it can be an overwhelmingly strong <em>reason for play</em> that goes beyond CA.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446390/#Comment_446390" name="Item_114" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-13T20:38:29+00:00" title="July 13, 2015  8:38PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This stuff is all semantics, for sure.

(If "to relax" is an agenda, then I am also engaging this agenda when I choose to watch TV or meditate, or go for a walk in the park.

Adam said this above, but it's easy to lose sight of, particularly because we can see specific <i>games</i> as <b>facilitating</b>, and individual <i>players</i> as <b>preferring</b> a particular GNS mode (even as they also hold preferences for particular genres, techniques, and players over others). But the Creative Agenda of a group is something that only becomes visible within that group over a long enough time, as the group members demonstrate appreciation for and thereby reinforce particular individual contributions to play. This sometimes requires some rather extensive debriefing in order to decipher (see the old Forge thread started by Levi Kornelson in 2006, <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=20679.0" rel="nofollow">Frostfolk and GNS Aggravation</a>, for example).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446410/#Comment_446410" name="Item_121" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-13T23:58:44+00:00" title="July 13, 2015 11:58PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Bill said. More specifically, I believe the unit of observation is the play group during a given instance of play. A play group might have one CA on Tuesday and a different one on Wednesday, for the same Champions campaign (but probably not).<br/><br/>And thus, this:\n<blockquote>1) My interpretation that the Creative Agenda is a goal in itself. </blockquote>\ndoesn't work within that definition. A group of people can all share a priority or they can not share a priority. I think "goal" is a little different than "priority," which I prefer. You can have two goals, but only one of them can be a priority.<br/><br/>I'll add that Ron's 2003 Story Now essay does say that individuals have Creative Agendas:<br/><br/><b>Narrativism: Story Now, by Ron Edwards:</b>\n<blockquote>Creative Agenda is the blanket term for people's demonstrated goals and desired feedback during play. In the past, I called it "GNS." Since all of this is enclosed in Social Contract, GNS-stuff is not only "what I want" but also "what I want from role-playing with this group of people." Since Exploration necessarily includes System, that means, as soon as we start talking about Creative Agenda, real play has begun.<br/><br/>On paper, I draw this term as an arrow, because this "step" or "level" in my model shifts out of the abstract and solidly into this group, playing this game, this way, at this time. The model instantly ceases to be a broad overview and becomes a diagnostic or description of a real play-experience among real people. Unless you are thinking of such a case, you will be left flailing at this point in the discussion.</blockquote>\nThings to take from that:<br/><br/>1. CA is a goal, but it's a /demonstrated/ goal.<br/>2. CA doesn't make sense out of the context of "role-playing with this group of people."<br/>3. CA doesn't make sense out of the context of real, actual play.<br/><br/>Thus,<br/><br/>4. CA isn't about a person's /abstract/ preferences about role-playing.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446413/#Comment_446413" name="Item_122" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T00:33:12+00:00" title="July 14, 2015 12:33AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2015 12:33AM by Adam_Dray.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, here's the bit I wanted to talk about:<br/><br/><b>Ron Edwards in "<a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=20679.msg215741#msg215741" rel="nofollow">Frostfolk and GNS Aggravation</a>":</b>\n<blockquote>PART TWO: AVOID THIS RED HERRING, PLEASE<br/><br/>I am uninterested in personal motivations.

I think that you can affirm the existence of broad nature of Creative Agenda by external observation of the social cues (you can see from a person when they're interested and excited, or you can ask them, for instance), but I likewise fail to understand how the Creative Agenda <i>modes</i> of GNS can be derived or postulated without a model of the mind and some pretty heavy assumptions about what people value and how.<br/><br/>After all, the key tenets of GNS concern cohesion and incohesion of Creative Agenda at the game table, and if we discount psychology as an explanation for that, then we have <i>nothing</i> whatsoever to explain why or how this should be the case. I guess we could just take it as a given that transcendent insight has provided us with the idea of the GNS modes, and we can still test them as social behaviours to some degree, but as I said, it's all quite tricky if one refuses to acknowledge or explain the underlying psychology of creativity even a little bit. We're stuck with a theory that predicts events based on antecedents that are undefined (maybe this player will perform a Gamist agenda at the table, but we can't know until he does), and does not explain the predictions in any way. It's like doing astrology without seeing the sky: we can say that clearly those people having marital troubles is because their star signs are in opposition this month, and we know that their star signs are in opposition because they are having marital troubles <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Disagreeing with Ron, I should say, never was that uncommon at the Forge.

I think that you shouldn't read too much into the notion that CA is expressed in group action - what Ron means by that is that we cannot discern CA (he believes) unless we look at what people are doing in a social circumstance. That does not mean that CA only exists in coherent group action, it means that we can only see people exercise a CA in the context of group action. Thus, a "CA conflict" or "CA clash" is when a group does not have a coherent Creative Agenda because individual players are acting upon conflicting CAs.<br/><br/>As far as I understand Ron's thinking, I think that he agrees that individual players can <i>hold</i> a Creative Agenda, we just cannot truly perceive what it is until we see that player actually engage or fail to engage in play behaviour with their gaming group. This is a pretty practical opinion as far as it goes, there are certainly all sorts of pitfalls in self-reporting and such, people sure can deceive themselves in all sorts of ways. An individual player having a Creative Agenda is pretty fundamental to the theory (as are the psychological anteriors of how that agenda comes about and why, if you ask me), as that's where CA conflict basically comes from: individual players with their own life experiences and interests join together to play a game, and they discover that the other players are playing "wrong". If we say that the CA somehow just comes into existence at the moment that the play starts, we're basically just complexifying the terminology for no real gain: we still need to consider the personal creative interests, except for some reason we're no longer calling them "Creative Agenda", but something else apparently.<br/><br/>My <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/446439/#Comment_446439" rel="nofollow">example of a CA conflict</a> from the other thread is an example of an individual player's Creative Agenda clashing with that of the rest of the group - I see you already read that and commented upon it <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446463/#Comment_446463" name="Item_128" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T15:32:06+00:00" title="July 14, 2015  3:32PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So it's clear, I don't quote Ron the way people quote Leviticus. I'm not appealing to authority, here. It's just that Ron said it best, most of the time, and I was part of some of those discussions back then and feel like we all came to some conclusions together, and Ron represented what we figured out. That is, what Ron said, I pretty much continue to believe.\n<blockquote>As far as I understand Ron's thinking, I think that he agrees that individual players can <i>hold</i> a Creative Agenda, we just cannot truly perceive what it is until we see that player actually engage or fail to engage in play behaviour with their gaming group. </blockquote>\nI'm not sure what Ron's thinking is on that matter. Mine is that using CA to refer to player psychology is a mire I want to avoid, so in my world, CA is a group thing. Players have goals and preferences, and you can slap labels on them like Sim and Narr and Step on Up but those things are not what I mean by CA, because CA is a very specific quality held by a group of people playing a game together.<br/><br/>I mean, it's an arrow slicing through a bunch of layers of a model, and one of the layers is Exploration, or Shared Imagined Space. It's shared, so it can't ever apply to just one person. It makes no sense to think of it as a personal thing.<br/><br/>Yeah, there are things that look a lot like personal-CA or personal-Exploration, but they're not in the Big Model in that sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446482/#Comment_446482" name="Item_129" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T17:44:02+00:00" title="July 14, 2015  5:44PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It's just that Ron said it best, most of the time</blockquote>That's just, like, your opinion, man.

Anyway, part of this discussion in /this thread/ is actually about "Ron's GNS player model" not "Adam's idea of the model," so I think it's important /to this thread/ to know what Ron said.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446549/#Comment_446549" name="Item_138" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T21:59:36+00:00" title="July 14, 2015  9:59PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ron's writing is so odd.
