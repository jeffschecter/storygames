It's been described as 'a bit HeroQuest like but with lots of D6'. The site describes it as:<br/><br/>[blurb]<br/><br/>Wordplay is a roleplaying game where everything that can be described has the power to affect the story that you and your friends will tell together.<br/><br/>Describe a thing, assign it a number of dice and roll them to see how it influences the story that you are all telling.<br/><br/>This book can turn any place that your imagination may care to take you into an absorbing and creative storytelling adventure game.<br/><br/>At the heart of Wordplay are characters. Become a pivotal character in your story, described using your own written words, giving them form and purpose.<br/><br/>Easy to play in any setting you wish, Wordplay is a rules light game with endless possibilities.<br/><br/>All you need are pens, paper and lots of six sided dice to be ready to play. [12mm 4x9 d6 dice block, probably the most powerful dice block in the world and could blow your gaming table away..]<br/><br/>[/blurb]<br/><br/><a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/paperback-book/wordplay-core-edition/7815192" rel="nofollow">Available here.</a><br/><br/>Cheers                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
