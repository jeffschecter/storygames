As the police and fire brigade arrived, the Brain tried to stick up for his mates but had to be saved by the Ferret, allowing the Nutter to steal a police car that they all drove to the clubs. More mayhem followed, with the Fist breaking open a fire door to skip the queue and the Nutter &amp; Alpha running into a girl they had both shagged who was now pregnant... which didn\u2019t stop the Brain from copping off with her too!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mechanics worked brilliantly: despite not rolling any dice, the Alpha was the first one to clock one his Moods up to 6 and take the Pain. He managed it purely by manipulating his mates, just what the Alpha is meant to do. Most of the archetypes worked like they were intended to, so just a little tweaking of Habits is required to get rid of some deadweight.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe night out heated up and ended with the lads scarpering from a stolen bus that had had a narrow miss with Dixon\u2019s in the high street, while coppers blocked off each end of the road. The Ferret distracted the coppers by hurling electrical goods at them, but his pissed ex-girlfriend Sharon (yeah, and the pregnant girl was called Tracy, of course) decided <i>she</i> wanted a turn at bus-driving and reversed it over him! He went splat right in front of his mates, as a result of which:<br/>\nthe Brain went on a permanent bender, dancing his lonely nights away in the corner of the club, shunned by all<br/>\nthe Fist and the Nutter both got religion and joined a Christian Evangelical movement that had been plaguing them all night<br/>\nthe Fixer kept using until he finally OD\u2019ed<br/>\nand the Alpha ended up looking after the Ferret\u2019s loved ones as they mourned his death.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a top game and Scott has volunteered to run it for the Pompey Crew at Indiecon!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294239/#Comment_294239" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-22T03:18:28+00:00" title="September 22, 2010  3:18AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like Killing Puppies for England.
