The turn needs to resolve in a reasonable amount of real time at the table.  The scope of the scene needs to advance the character(s) a 'step' closer to resolving their goal one one way or the other, without being too great or too small.<br/><br/>What is the essence of sensible scope limitation, distilled as concisely as possible?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475516/#Comment_475516" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-19T01:20:29+00:00" title="July 19, 2018  1:20AM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 19, 2018 1:21AM by DeReel.">edited July 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is classic narrative pieve advice to begin as close as possible to the crisis.
