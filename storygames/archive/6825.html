I've been using <a href="http://nearbygamers.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://nearbygamers.com</a> to find people.<br/><br/>I'm thinking of it like dating, right?  Step 1:  Meet someone on internet, talk, figure out if you want to meet them in real life.  Step 2: Meet in real life, get to know each other, get something to eat, talk about what you want out of gaming / relationships.  Step 3: Plan a campaign or a one-shot, Step 4: Go Play!  (I leave it to your imagination what step 4 might be in the dating analogy...)<br/><br/>But just like dating, sometimes you get into a really bad scene.  You're clearly not compatible at all, but the other person doesn't realize it.  You don't want to see them again; you don't even want to finish dinner (or character creation), you just want to Get Out Now!  But you don't want to be a jerk about it.<br/><br/>Last weekend I had a pretty bad experience like this.  Partly I want to vent about it a little, but more constructively, I want to talk about two questions:<br/><br/>1. What are the warning signs that help you recognize that the group or game that you're about to join will not be fun for you?<br/><br/>2. What's the most diplomatic way to decline participation?

Instantaneous declaring rule variations to be "wrongbadfun." Staring dumbfounded when handed narrative authority. A certain tone of voice and choice of diction (you KNOW the one... yes, you do, admit it). A notebook for a "character sheet". A pointy Viking hat. A box full of AOE templates and rulers and--well, actually, I kinda like minis crunch, if I know I'm getting into it in advance....\n<blockquote>2.

Gimme a call if you're ever wanting to try out some __________; but I've pretty much gotten tired of _____ over the years and want to branch out."<br/><br/>Kinder than my last girlfriend's "we're just too different" vagueness. Which left a bit of a "Wow, rather be alone than with me?" feeling that is unsavory, at best--give a reason why and it's usually all good. If the reason why requires pointing out an odious flaw, then console yourself with the fact that negative social feedback generally results in positive change... or killing sprees.<br/><br/>So... to plug in one deal-breaker from the above, at random:<br/>"Folks, I was kinda lookin' for something <span style="text-decoration: underline;">less stank of piss</span>, and it looks like y'all don't dig <span style="text-decoration: underline;">bathing</span>.

Last weekend:  the GM has just invited several complete strangers over to his house, and after "hello my name is" and shaking hands he wants to jump straight into generating characters for a long-term campaign.  I mean, socially, this is pretty weird, right?  Even if some role-players don't mind it (when I was a little younger, and less aware of social interactions, I wouldn't have noticed the weirdness), how am I supposed to know whether I even want to role-play with these people or not when I have no idea who they are yet?<br/><br/>In this case, the GM was using his status as GM and host to sort of totally dominate the pace of the conversation, so there was no chance for me to even try to start up a conversation with the other players about who they were or anything outside the game.  It made me pretty uncomfortable.  It was also pretty clear he expected significant buy-in to a long-term campaign (committing to a certain time each week, making characters suitable for long-term play) without even asking whether that's what the rest of us wanted or not. <br/><br/>If this had been for a one-shot at a convention I might have felt differently, but this was at the GM's house and he was clearly expecting us to commit to a long game without getting to know each other.  I felt a little like I had met someone on a first date and was immediately asked to pick out a wedding dress.<br/><br/>To be continued...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20Arntson" title="Zak Arntson"><img alt="Zak Arntson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/147/nVMQWQSYECWCV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20Arntson">Zak Arntson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151936/#Comment_151936" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-20T13:29:57+00:00" title="June 20, 2008  1:29PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Next time, be sure to open up the experience by telling the group that you're looking for a compatible group.

Whether or not you can do that, once you're to the point of  auditioning (or auditioning for) a group, ask lots of specific questions about playstyle and tone.  Discuss what kind of character options would work for the game.  Do not allow yourself to project your own prejudices onto what they say.  If the detailed and specific information you get from these discussions doesn't feel good to you, don't go for it.  Alternately, if you haven't been able to get detailed and specific information out of them, don't go for it; while it's possible to find a great group that's not comfortable talking explicitly about goals and expectations, it's not very likely.<br/><br/>Also, be very honest and detailed about what your expectations are, and what kind of game you would like to participate in.  Give them plenty of opportunity to tell you that your kind of roleplaying sounds stupid and lame.<br/><br/>As to question 2, just keep it simple, and keep it about yourself.  "I don't think I'm a good fit for your group, so I'm going to bow out."  You are not some holy prophet come out of the desert, who must bring truth to the people.

So after the first session (which was all character-creation and campaign-prep), even though I was thinking that I would probably not enjoy this GM's way of running things, I decided I was willing to give it a chance, so I came back for the second session, thinking I'd make a decision whether to continue or not after I had played with these people a little bit.<br/><br/>Went back for the second session.  There was still no talking about anything outside the game, and the GM made it clear that we still weren't going to be playing because there was still more prep to be done.  "Maybe your characters are finished in your minds, but they're not done to my satisfaction yet", he said.  That attitude was another sign that I was not going to get along with the GM on either a how-the-game-is-run level or on a pure personality level.  It seemed like he was very committed to "big design up front" -- as in, deciding everything in preparation rather than in play, on both sides of the screen.  My suggestion that we leave some parts of our characters' backgrounds sketchy, start the game in medias res, and fill in missing stuff later with flashbacks was met with blank stares from all around.  My suggestion that I'd rather not track encumbrance was met with an "I'll track it for you, then" from the GM.<br/><br/>I don't want this thread to turn into "OMG they were having BadWrongFun", but this game was starting to sound about as fun to me as doing homework.  The rest of the players were in full blown "Hey, can I have this particular ability from an obscure supplement?" mode.<br/><br/>So anyway, the GM asked me what options I was gonna take from his House Rules list of extra combat options (cuz D&amp;D3.5 isn't already complicated enough int that regard?), and that's when I said "You know what... I don't mean to be rude, but... I don't think I'm going to be joining this campaign after all.  I don't think I'm a good match for this group's play style."<br/><br/>Awkward silence.  One player:  "I didn't know we had a play style yet."<br/><br/>What I wanted to say, but did not say:  "Look guys, I can already feel a personality clash between me and the GM here, so if I stay in, I guarantee there's eventually going to be a power struggle between us that will destroy the game for everyone else."<br/><br/>What I actually said:  "Um, so... yeah... it's not that I don't like y'all, but I don't think I'm very compatible with this group, and besides, six PCs is an awful lot so it might be better if I bow out...   there's another campaign I'm thinking of joining instead... Good luck, I hope you all have fun, bye."<br/><br/>I felt like it was a pretty lame series of excuses, but I made the right decision.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jono" title="Jono"><img alt="Jono" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jono">Jono</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151980/#Comment_151980" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-20T14:47:18+00:00" title="June 20, 2008  2:47PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite>Never start in on a big long campaign with strangers.

Trust that this will be a good experience. If you look for errors or excuses to back out from the beginning, it is very difficult to build trust.<br/><br/>If we are talking about how to screen a game group before you have commited to play: Ask them about recent gaming experiences that they enjoyed.

Step out of the fiction, check with everyone: So how do you think about this? Try to be very specific and ask about something that has happened at the table. If you then feel that the mood at the table is not moving in a satisfying direction for you, then you can say: Ok, I have tried this game. It was fun to xxx. However, I don't want to play any more of this. Is it ok for you, if I quit?<br/><br/>I have once been too polite to skip a game that was not happening for me.

Would have enjoyed either of those.<br/><br/>What I don't enjoy, and what I think this campaign would have been, is the worst of both worlds:  where the GM wants it to be "all about the story!" but sees the story as something only he creates, and "I want you guys to role-play!" where role-playing means only acting out our personalities without taking any actions that would endanger group cohesion or the pre-written storyline, so our decision-making is mainly limited to our fight tactics, which the GM then renders meaningless by fudging die rolls to make sure we stay alive and the fight goes how he wants it.

You can say that you prefer to play with a focus on shared authorship and collaborative storytelling, but the difficulty, in my experience, is that most railroading GMs think that their games <b>are</b> built on shared authorship.<br/><br/>Some of what you said was about what you <i>didn't</i> like, which was basically pre-plotted, fudge-heavy games with no player autonomy.  If you want to convey that positively, i.e. as what you <i>do</i> like, you could say that you like sandbox-style play, where events and encounters are not planned in advance.<br/><br/>Ultimately, a lot of this comes down to what I said earlier - describe what you want out of gaming in detail and at length, and give the other players plenty of opportunity to tell you that it sounds dumb.  That will tell you what you want to know.  Trying to come up with a shorthand is largely counterproductive, because in most cases, players who are not familiar with the language will just find ways to interpret it as referring to the way they play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151997/#Comment_151997" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-20T15:27:00+00:00" title="June 20, 2008  3:27PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To build on what Josh said, only play one-shots with people you don't know.

What are the warning signs that help you recognize that the group or game that you're about to join will not be fun for you?</blockquote>\nEasiest, is if you get through 1-2 sessions and aren't having fun.<br/><br/>In my group, frex, about I dunno 5-6 years ago, Rafael Chandler (Dread:TFBOP) came to my weekly game session. Unfortunately, it was when one of the other players, not me, was DMing D&amp;D 3e, and unfortunately, he wasn't a very good DM. That is to say, he's the kind who, if you do something unexpected, he'll do whatever it takes to try to get you back on the path of the adventure.  If you Must Do X to get to the next area/scene/end, then by god you HAVE to find and do X. He's creative, which is why we let him DM from time to time, but too long and things start to break down.<br/><br/>Anyway, Rafael ended up rolling up a rogue. The DM didn't think to include him until like 2 hours into the game, instead looking for a "good place" for him to fit into the story. Also, the DM didn't know that Raf was "trying out" our group, not coming in this one session and thus committed to a long-haul campaign (differences in expectations). Raf's rogue jumped into action and tried to stab an NPC (basically a mob boss) because the NPC was holding information, threatening us, etc. In D&amp;D you might not do that, but in any action movie? You'd totally do it. But unfortunately, rolls were made, weight put on the player, and the rogue got punked quickly, and the story resumed course. In the end, the style that he wanted wasn't there in our group under that DM, and it didn't work out (see below).\n<blockquote>2. What's the most diplomatic way to decline participation?  (How about if you've already created a character?)</blockquote>\n"Crap, at work I've been assigned to a new project which is taking up more of my off-work hours than I can control. I'm really very sorry, but it looks like I'm going to have to back out for now. This totally caught me off guard."<br/><br/>A white lie, everyone saves face. Some folks disapprove of white lies, and would suggest that you instead "help them improve themselves" by, as you walk out of their session, you break it down for the GM bluntly what it is you don't like about him, the group, the play, etc". Personally, I don't like to be confrontational, it's too delicate a situation to balance without looking or acting like a dick. For me, giving them criticism is something you'd do if you plan on sticking it out, not if you plan on bailing.<br/><br/>In the above example, Raf bowed out, saying he had an early work day tomorrow. Later, he wrote us saying that work picked up and he won't be able to come. Then, on the side, to me, he said "Holy fuck that was boring. I seriously can't commit to that, man, it was driving me fucking nuts." I was thinking that he might have more fun under me or another GM, but unfortuantely that campaign (which got more interesting as it went on) was to go on for a while, so we didn't press the issue. Rafael's excuse didn't offend me one whit, and I didn't reveal that white lie to the DM in order to "straighten him out" or whatever. Later on I gave some pointers, after adventures were over, but never a lecture.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152005/#Comment_152005" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-20T15:43:35+00:00" title="June 20, 2008  3:43PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jono</cite>1.

I've come to a point where I'm confident with my gut feeling and if the vibes feel wrong I don't need anymore to go and discover why the group feels wrong. There won't be anything I can change about it anyway.

Some folks disapprove of white lies, and would suggest that you instead "help them improve themselves" by, as you walk out of their session, you break it down for the GM bluntly what it is you don't like about him, the group, the play, etc".

For me, giving them criticism is something you'd do if you plan on sticking it out, not if you plan on bailing.</br></br></blockquote>\nYeah, this is the route I'd go with; I figure that in nearly any situation where I'm deciding to step back from joining a particular group, they are probably about as interested in my actual reasons for saying "Thanks, but no thanks" as I am in sharing those reasons with them...which is to say, not at all.<br><br>I think it's perfectly acceptable -- and even advisable -- to lie like a rug when saying <i>why</i> you won't be back.  It harms no one, and in nearly every conceivable circumstance a white lie will be faster and leave fewer bruises.<br><br>However, the thing to remember is to <i>never</i> lie about whether you'll be back.  If you're out, make sure they know that you're out.  No wishy-washy "I'm not sure what my schedule is like, I'll get back to you," or "I might not be here next week because my cousin is getting married," or "I'll call you if I can make it."  You can be as vague as you like about why you're gone, but you should leave no doubt that you ARE gone and that their game should move on with absolutely no expectation of you ever returning.  You can pretend to be sad about it (it's a nice touch that usually goes over well), as long as the non-negotiable finality of the decision is still made clear.<br><br><br/>(I'll admit to doing what Andy's friend Raf did -- give a pleasant white lie to the group and share the real reasons privately with one or two members of the group -- as a means of cherry-picking people I liked playing with from groups that I didn't particularly care for.  In fact, I've even sat in with a group I knew I didn't want to play with just so I could use it as a kind of back-door recruiting technique for the group I <i>did</i> want to play with.  That's kind of a shitty thing to do, but if push came to shove and our group needed more players, I'd probably do it again.)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152171/#Comment_152171" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-21T21:53:19+00:00" title="June 21, 2008  9:53PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jono</cite>What I actually said:  "Um, so... yeah... it's not that I don't like y'all, but I don't think I'm very compatible with this group, and besides, six PCs is an awful lot so it might be better if I bow out...   there's another campaign I'm thinking of joining instead...

I once played with a group where one player seemed to run into cool NPCs the whole time, interacting with them, and I thought "jesus, did the GM design EVERYTHING around this one character?" I envisioned several sessions of just sitting there listening to the two of them playing their little game. A session or two later, I understood that no, the GM hadn't designed ANY of those NPCs - the player just improvised fun things, the GM picked up on it, and they were more than eager to pick up on whatever I contributed when I finally started doing so.

This might just be a personal thing, but if you're feeling doubts up front, do NOT show up and play the first session before quitting. Express your doubts up front, before play begins. Because it's far easier to exclude a character from the game when they've not become part of the fiction. Once they're in the game, if your GM and fellow players have made any sort of effort to interconnect things, then they've wasted effort, and have more to do before they can satisfyingly continue play. <br/><br/>Not to say you did this, but you were ready to do so. As a GM, I'd have less problem if you stated after chargen that you weren't feeling it (would I be a little hurt/insulted? perhaps.) than if you wasted the group's efforts to make the game fit to your character. Now if your doubts came after play, then obviously it's better to say something than just stop showing up. In that case, the group has to continue stringing along whether or not your character will be worked out, killed off, made an NPC, whatever. Cut it short cleanly and clearly, and you'll leave a lot less bad blood behind. Unless they're all jerks, in which case, there's no good way to withdraw.<br/><br/>This may not apply to every GM and every group, as some groups consider the player characters to be largely plug and play. I don't, and I know that there are others like me, and it's insulting to find that players committed to the game with doubts in their minds, allowed me to get their characters balls-deep in the situation (sometimes making a whole session or two focus on the introduction of their characters) only to bow out without saying anything to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152554/#Comment_152554" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T17:29:00+00:00" title="June 23, 2008  5:29PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lance: I'd disagree.

Firstly, it's not advice for a group, it's advice for an individual.<br/><br/>The idea here is that you have misgivings before even beginning play. You agree to play, you commit to play either explicitly (it's always explicit in my groups; I tell people what I want before they ever join the group, which involves committing to be there every session unless circumstances interfere, and informing the group as soon as possible of any such circumstances) or implicitly by assisting in working your character into the situation. Bowing out at that point is discourteous if you had serious doubts about playing beforehand. Now, if you went into the group with full intent to be there, and then found the play not to your liking, it's understandable. You were honest and up front, and things just didn't work out. It sucks for them and you, but it couldn't be avoided short of precognition. <br/><br/>What sucks is (true story) when people express interest in joining your group. You make it as explicitly clear as you are able what the game is about, and what you expect. You accommodate them to the point of switching your gaming night to a night convenient for them. You spend a full session away from the primary story arc integrating them thickly into the situation. (Note at this point that "you" refers to the existing members of the group, not just the GM, if there is such) By the next session, you get, indirectly, that they will not be attending, and had been entertaining doubts about joining up in the first place, doubts which were not expressed prior to joining. At this point, you have to spend even more time coming up with a frequently lame explanation why these characters are suddenly gone, and you're left with the feeling that you could have accomplished more if they'd never tried to join.

But the wording here "and you're left with the feeling that you could have accomplished more if they'd never tried to join". Perhaps I'm reading too much into this, but it sounds like you feel obliged to accept anyone who wants to join, because otherwise your being exclusionist and that's 'bad'. And since your forced to accept anyone, they should watch out when they try to join, since you have not way to resist unless you want to be exclusionist bad guys.<br><br/>I don't think it's being a bad guy to exclude someone - thus some (not all, some) responsiblity rests with you if you accept them. I ran into something like this in a LOTRO guild, where the guy had to make me into a bad guy in order to kick me from the guild - he didn't want to be an exclusionist bad guy, but since I brought up a slash command he thought was cheating, he would not see I was discussing with him to see if our playstyles matched or not. He posted to everyone that 'a guild member admitted to cheating' (as well as demeaning forum post) and kicked me. He could never be an exclusionist and say 'Sorry, doesn't really match the guilds playstyle, catch you latter' because that'd be a <i>bad</i> thing to do. IMO, in trying to avoid something he thought was bad but isn't, he did something that actually was worse than the bad he imagined exclusionism is.<br/><br/>Okay, the LOTRO example doesn't directly support anything, but it was fun getting it off my chest!                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152610/#Comment_152610" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-24T00:40:03+00:00" title="June 24, 2008 12:40AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like to challenge the use of the lie, 'Sorry, real life issues have blown up and I can't commit' as valid nowadays/<br/>\n<br/>\nThe use of this excuse has become so ubiquitous as a way of ducking out of gaming commitments that, in my eyes, it has virtually no value except saying 'I don't have the balls to say what it really wrong between me and your game/raid/guild/design group etc so I am going to hoist a shield of socially unquestionable responsibility to avoid you.'<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I am not  suggesting that 'real life issues' don't exist - I know they do. In fact, I have just had to cancel a game tonight because I was scooted into hospital this weekend! However I am also more than aware that each and every gamer I know - be that for RPGs, MMOs or CCGs - has a ready made arsenal of excuses that they can drop instead of saying 'I don't want to play tonight' or 'I'm really not enjoying this game, I'll pass until the campaign is over.' I'm sure we all have them for work as well. Bulletproof sick day excuses - 'childcare issues with sick children' being the best one. Isn't it AMAZING how childcare complications only occur when children are ill?!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is that by using and condoning this sort of empty, invulnerable excuse we denegrate the importance of our gaming time. Years ago, when my current group was formed it was done under the emphasis that from the dozen or so players that could have joined, those that did would actually be the ones that would give their gaming some precedence in their lives other than the lowest. Previously we had people cancel gaming for trips to the library, watching a half hour TV soap, wanting to wash their dog  - you get the idea. They were adamant that they wanted to game, they just couldn't care less when or where. Weekly, monthly, yearly - whatever. Subsequently, nothing got done. By having a group that is actually willing to say 'Sorry, can't go to the movies that night, its gaming night' it elevates the game to a higher priority level and measn thata  whole raft of 'real life issues' are no longer ... well, issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to see an area where this has become used in almost epidemic proportions, look at MMOs (missing raids and dropping out of active guild activity due to 'real life issues' is everywhere) and serial fanfic (where entire series can be put on hold indefinitely for the reason - a reason that can only be met with empty untargetted sympathy). In fact I cannot think of a facet of my life where I haven't seen people cry off on multiple occassions for 'real life issues'<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd FAR rather someone gave me some feedback on my game and how and why it didn't work for them (because lets face it, no matter how good you are at GMing, you cannot please everyone) than fobbing me off with am empty excuse which is more likely than not a lie anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152634/#Comment_152634" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-24T03:36:55+00:00" title="June 24, 2008  3:36AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Neil Gow</cite>I don't have the balls to say what it really wrong</blockquote>\nWhoo!

Consider: they are seeking new blood; they found it; it ran screaming. Which is "kinder" (fuck fear of confrontation, BTW--get over it): letting them blindly grope through a series of strangers, alienating folks left and right, or telling it to them honestly and (hopefully) they give it some thought and (lo!) grow a bit as gamers and social beings? The reasons are several why a game won't "make"--everyone is hovering over play agenda, but there's everything from lack of shared spotlight to sheer odiousness. Odds are good a "problem" in a game is also, to some degree, a problem in RL.<br><br>Is this "t eh messiah in the desert?" No--and the hyperbolic implication of moral superiority is offensive to those of us who value social feedback, inclusion, and honesty. Sure, if it's just "style of play," then say, "Hey, not my bag--I do different stuff." But if it's something that could, oh, get the person's ass kicked in the wrong bars, then be just a conscientious, concerned, involved participant in these folks lives (if only for the last time): 90% of the time, they'll think you're a dick for any number of reasons having nothing to do with your efforts to be honest and helpful. Fine: you're walking anyway. But the 10% who CAN listen and think and self-reflect might end up, a few years down the road, trying to remember your name because, damn, you really opened his eyes and made him a better person. (OK, may 5% or 3%.)<br><br>Sure, if you don't give a damn about them, and are too much of a girly man--running to hide in your girly house--to be able to give constructive, diplomatic criticism for the betterment of your gaming society without fear of being thought a dick (again--who cares?) then lie your ass off.<br><br>Hell, make it fun: tell them "the aliens told you last night that 'it's time' and so, hey, it's been real!"<br>Say "my shrink thinks lobotomy is the only solution for my outbreaks of blind rage, and I doubt I'll be able to follow a game anymore afterwards."<br>"My dog ate all of my gaming books, and I'm too sad about it's death by dysentery to think of gaming anymore."<br/>"I knocked out my parole officer, so I'm off house arrest and back to the clink."<br/><br/>(RIP George.)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152683/#Comment_152683" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-24T09:00:34+00:00" title="June 24, 2008  9:00AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andrew, <br/><br/>Agreed. I confess that I've set myself up for that a few times, and sometimes it's worked out, and others it's been frustrating and sad. The time mentioned was not one of those times. I'd played with one of the dudes in two previous one-offs, and he'd brought the awesome. That he could have made a good addition to the group was not in question. What was in question was what he wanted from the game, and I was as clear as can be about what the game offered. <br/><br/>In a latter case, I met with the guy a few times at work, we talked gaming, I got an "eh" vibe off of him, and decided to invite him to form a gaming group anyhow. It bit me in the ass. It irritates me, but that was the risk I took. <br/><br/>But hey.. This thread seems more aimed at avoiding joining a group and/or leaving a group that you don't mesh with, rather than a group adding a player who doesn't mesh with them. So while your comments, and yours as well Callan, are well made and well taken, I think we're talking at cross-purposes. In both cases, the problem with the offered play was in the individual player. The group was fine with, or even enthusiastic about, that player's addition to the group. In this case, I think the onus of leaving courteously falls upon the person who has the issue with the play, not with the group who's fine with the player's contributions.<br/><br/>Also Niel's comments and the follow-on comments about honesty? Spot on. In both of my most prominent cases, a little up-front honesty would have eased my own sense of insult.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152691/#Comment_152691" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-24T09:15:04+00:00" title="June 24, 2008  9:15AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2008 10:52AM by Graham.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All right.<br/><br/>Just to let you know, I won't be posting to this thread any more, because it's becoming an exercise in argumentative Internet fuckwittery between bombastic idiots who don't have the intelligence or wit to make their moronic comments worth reading.<br/><br/>Is that useful feedback as I leave the thread?

If it's evasiveness then it might be annoying, or I might be concerned that someone said something to offend the person.

Maybe not so constructive, but at least not a lie. And (again) perhaps the parent will look around, realize "Hmmm, actually little Timmy is being a snot"--something the parent is probably accustomed to and doesn't hardly notice--and make amends for the next person trying out.<br/><br/>The whole issue depends (again) upon the group actually actively wanting a new player, for whatever reason. If you're just an adjunct player, tacked on for a session or two and easily jettisoned, then (again) the point becomes moot--the group won't change dysfunctional behavior if they have no motivation to be attractive to new player(s).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Callan S.</cite>To all: But basically when the person is a square peg, and the groups a round hole, how can they explain that the group should stop being what they are?</blockquote>\nYou can't, as I've said a couple of times: a difference in agenda or play style isn't easily resolved (without, say, offering to run a different game for the group). Nothing to "correct"--but STILL no reason to be a liar: "Sorry, guys, not my style of game; thanks anyway!"<br/><br/>I guess I'm just disinclined to lie for no good reason, when the truth isn't confrontational (i.e. "Not my style of game, folks; sorry"). It seems that folks encourage telling a lie rather than pointing out correctable (a requirement, if one's "critique" is to be salient) shortcoming. I find that a disservice to the group who was trying to recruit AND a disservice to your own moral fiber (if I may use that old saw). Why leave them floundering AND muddy up your "soul"? I just don't get it--and I doubt being from some particular island or continent has anything to do with a blase approach to falsehood....<br/><br/>Anyhow... thread's turning into a spinning gyre:<br/>"NO, lie, it's easier and kinder!"<br/>"NO, be honest and try to help where you can!"

It had obviously come from an abusive home, as it would run away any time you picked up anything with a long handle (broom, rake, etc.) It also barked. A LOT. It would bark at anyone who would walk by. It had made a literal trench in the yard at the end of its leash where it would strain and bark and follow people back and forth who walked on the sidewalk. It was always a point of irritation when I visited him. I dropped a few subtle hints about how its barking was disruptive when we were watching a movie, etc. Sometimes he would bring it in, sometimes not. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a few years, someone poisoned the dog and it died.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess my point is, subtle hints do nothing to a game group for problems they don't perceive they have. Might as well leave not burning any bridges.

If I had all the time in the world, I might think to say something along the lines of "Sorry folks, we've met twice now, and it's just not at all what I was hoping to get out of a regular game.  I'm going to keep hunting."  I also like the reference above to round pegs and square holes; it's a dirt-common analogy for "it's not working, nobody's to blame."  I may use it in the future.<br/><br/>As far as danger signs: same as anywhere else.  Lack of social skills and/or basic respect for time/energy/opinion = time to go.<br/><br/>James                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6825/how-to-escape-from-a-bad-group-without-hurting-feelings" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6825/how-to-escape-from-a-bad-group-without-hurting-feelings" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6825/how-to-escape-from-a-bad-group-without-hurting-feelings/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F6825%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F6825%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
