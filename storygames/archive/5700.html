So that a whole bunch of great games basically get forced under the waterline until they drown, because all these new games are clambering over them to get to the surface.<br/><br/>Which, like, is great and all... but as someone who doesn't design, I feel bad for those old games.

I'm [i]interested[/i] in all the wacky stuff that's come out since 2003, but I'm still assimilating and appreciating the stuff from five years ago--and these are just the games that got a lot of attention, to say nothing of the under appreciated games from that era.</blockquote>\nI agree with your sentiments.  In fact, there was a big bull session last night at Orccon.  (It started at midnight and went till four in the morning!  I have to add Paul Tevis did a great job of moderating.) <br/><br/>Much of the discussion that took place was about the issue of games competing for attention in a market with so many games.<br/><br/>I'm not a designer, however, so my take was different than many of the people present.  As Paul put it, "CK is here speaking as a GM."  I'd add, especially in the context of this thread, I'm a consumer of games, not a maker.<br/><br/>At the con this weekend, I ran <i>Primetime Adventures</i>, <i>HeroQuest</i> (set in Glorantha), and <i>Pendragon</i>.  I played <i>Don't Rest Your Head</i>, a Jeep form game ("Upgrade"),<i> Unknown Armies</i>, and <i>In a Wicked Age</i>.  <br/><br/>I hadn't played <i>Pendragon</i> in years, had never played <i>HeroQuest</i> before, and had run and played <i>Primetime Adventures</i> several time over the last two years.<br/><br/>It occurred to me during the conversation last night that while the designers were working hard to figure out how to get people to buy play their games, I was a content man.  See, I have <i>Primetime Adventures</i>, <i>Sorcerer</i> (and supplements), <i>HeroQuest</i> and <i>Pendragon</i>.  With those four rules sets I have four very different games that deliver everything I want from games.  (I've loved <i>Pendragon</i> for years, think <i>Sorcerer</i> just rocks, fell for <i>Primetime Adventure</i> while running it at cons, and yesterday <i>HeroQuest</i> did everything I was told it would do and it's now on The List.)<br/><br/>I'm not saying there aren't other games that delivery what I want.  I'm saying I've got four right now.  Why work hard to find them when I've got four rock solid games that deliver the goods I want and deliver them very well?<br/><br/>Note also I'm not saying I won't play other games.  I had never played <i>Don't Rest Your Head</i>, <i>Unknown Armies</i>, Jeep form, nor <i>In a Wicked Age</i> until this past weekend.  I'm saying going out to master new games and information when I already have four games I've invested doesn't make much sense.  This is all trumped by the fact, of course, that not many games apparently have grabbed me and said, "Yes, i want to find people to play <i>that</i> game with!"  I know what I want to play.  I got them.  I want to gather them to play them.  <br/><br/>All of that is in turn trumped by the fact that reading games and learning how to play them is a pain in the ass. I check out new games.  The mechanics and intent of the mechanics are often obscure; the game mechanics after have terrible flaws in them; I cannot escape the feeling that most games require the person who wrote the book to sit down with me for a couple of sessions as the GM so I can see how the thing is supposed to work.  I would put, by the way, <i>Sorcerer</i>, <i>HeroQuest</i>, and <i>Primetime Adventures</i> in this camp.  However, I've done my work on these games.  The thought of having to go through it again for another game just doesn't seem worth it -- especially since I have  four games I could run till the day I die.<br/><br/>Does this mean I'll never play a new game?  Or that I'll never buy a new one?  No.  But like James, I'm content with the older games right now.  <br/><br/>[continued]                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127386/#Comment_127386" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-18T19:17:40+00:00" title="February 18, 2008  7:17PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 18, 2008 8:45PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [continued]<br/><br/>I find it interesting that the games I love are old to older: <i>Pendragon</i> is 25 years old; <i>Sorcerer</i> 7 years old.  Only <i>Primetime Adventures</i> and <i>HeroQuest</i> are relatively new.  And even then, once you figure in that HeroQuest was 25 years in the making is actually the full expression mechanically of Stafford's Glorantha setting, my tastes are pretty fucking old -- and that surprises me.<br/><br/>I guess this is my way of saying I don't feel bad for the older games -- simply because I want to play them. I'll bring them to Cons (they always fill up) and I'll gather people to play them.  I mean, I think frankly we need more playing.  <br/><br/>I'm saying, the indie field might ask, "What do people need?"  I don't think we need more games.  There's nothing <i>wrong</i> with more gams.  I just don't think we need them right now. <br/><br/>What I do think we need is to learn to play <i>better</i>.<br/><br/>As Joshua Newman wrote:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C. Newman</cite>Ryan just reminded me: I started thinking about this a couple of months ago. I was starting to see abstract "sales" and "con slots filled", and I was grouchy about shipping books. Then I remembered that I never got to<em>play</em>Shock: because it was always overbooked. I wasn't saying no to people showing up to play, and it was making me really crabby.<br/><br/>So I decided, OK, I'm gonna only run games with three other people. That means that I get full participation (I usually play Audience, which means I get stuff to do, but I don't get a Protagonist) and I get to have a lot more fun with the world and I get to make moral statements in the way the game's designed to support.<br/><br/>All of a sudden, more fun! And more fun has led to more sales! I can honestly and enthusiastically recommend the game, and I know this is weird to say, but I<em>understand</em>the game better. Like, I had all these parts that theoretically did stuff, but I was so wrapped up in the cogs that I couldn't play with the whole machine.<br/><br/>So, if publishing or selling is getting in the way of your play, drop them down a notch and play your damn game. Then do the next part that will add to your satisfaction.</blockquote>\n<br/>It'd be sweet if we could sidestep the "play better" issue by saying, "The new games help people play better."  But that's not been my experience.  Because the new games (often met with great praise by people who -- as far as can tell -- have never played them) often have huge gaps in them and sometimes leave the players stranded in matters as blunt as conflict resolution.<br/><br/>So, that's pretty much what I ended up saying last night and wanted to say here: I think we need more work on playing well -- and the <i>newness</i> of a game, as far as I can tell, has little influence on us playing better.<br/><br/>Playing better means paying attention to techniques that we've learned from many games, learning how to communicate effective techniques and habits of play to new players, being aware of our habits and techniques.  Issues of pacing.  Getting description and color comfortably out of our mouths to evoke more detail and pleasure from words and images.  Picking away at what good scene framing is, if appropriate.  What tools help Players get on a narrative track from the get-go, and so on....<br/><br/>Craft, really, I guess is what I'm talking about.  The craft of <i>play</i>, not design.<br/><br/>I'm not saying don't design games, or don't publishing games.  That's between you and God.  I'm talking what is going to make the experience of play better at the table.  ("Better" being the bugaboo of "Quality."  Sorry, but there it is!)<br/><br/>I thought I'd note directly to a bunch of designers that the answer to that question for me is to play and to player deeper with games I'm already satisfied with rather than get on another wheel to figure out how to play (and probably have to fix) another game.  <br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127399/#Comment_127399" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-18T20:04:13+00:00" title="February 18, 2008  8:04PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite><br/>Craft, really, I guess is what I'm talking about.  The craft of<i>play</i>, not design.</blockquote>\nActually, that's one of the core reasons why this site was created. I notice that it's always been a saloon for small-press or indie-vidual designer types, but the stated goal is to focus on playing games better. (in general, or specific tips on certain games or genres).<br/><br/>But I hear you. There's not a lot of stuff that's on the horizon that's tickling my spirits: With Inuma, PTA, In a Wicked Age, the upcoming D&amp;D 4e... I could pretty much retire with those and the scragglers here and there still on my shelf. I could play for 20 years and not care about buying a new game.<br/><br/>In fact, recently I've had to refocus my attention: In 2001 or 2002, maybe even 2003, I could literally buy Almost Every Small Press RPG that I Wanted. Nowadays, there are so many small and large games, coming from so many different angles, that my requirements shifted from "If it even looks cool, buy it!" to "I will only buy it if I have plans to actually run it". At GenCon, for example, I went from buying <i>everything</i> at the Forge booth, to buying <i>half </i>the games at it, to buying just a few (edit: I guess "a few" means "eight", looking at last year's collection). Still, my criteria for buying games has changed from "mining ideas" to "need to use it at the table".<br/><br/>When I dig around at reading threads, I pay particular attention to threads or discussions by folks like Judd, JD Corley, Jason M and others who I know are GMs, and run games all the time. Their posts are seeped with questions and discussions that are relevant not to designer-folk, but to the folks who are running and playing games.<br/><br/>Huh. I don't feel like I'm helping carry the discussion in any particular direction, but I just wanted to say, "Yeah, I feel it too". As a guy who potentially will "produce" an RPG this year (that means dropping it online, and if people like it then selling it for beer money), I've got to say that the topic of "How do I get more people to play my game" is one that stings. It's hard to consider, because there are in fact too many games competing for too little time. It was good design, plus a lot of luck, which got games like Dungeon Squad and red Box Hack played and talked about constantly (sometimes perhaps 'too much so", even :-) ). So I've had to take advice from Eric Provost, who was learning how to deal with pushing his freebie games on the net. Well, people have said it before, but still: Design for Yourself. If other people play it, then awesome. If other people don't play it, then that sucks, but at least you've got your game which you still (presumably) play. That's a good mindset to adopt at times, I think. You don't have to be all "Why God Why don't people play my game! Why do they keep talking about Exalted and Spirit of the Century on RPGNet instead of my games?"<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127406/#Comment_127406" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-18T20:41:14+00:00" title="February 18, 2008  8:41PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>games like Dungeon Squad and red Box Hack played and talked about constantly</blockquote>\nPeople are still looking for their D&amp;D.

I've enjoyed the games that have come out of it, so I'm not knocking it, but I'm tired of seeing both play <i>and</i> theory take a back seat.  They all inform each other, they're all interesting and important.

You have four games you love, and you don't need the new ones. I've been feeling the same way lately (but it's a feeling that comes and goes and I don't put much stock in it). What I doubt very much is that some larger community needs to take some action here.<br/><br/>We're all committed to improving our game play. Like Andy said, that's what this site is for, and it's offering an awful lot of goodness in that area. Some people improve their play by trying new games and learning new techniques through mastery of new systems. So I don't think that the production of new games is in some way antithetical to playing better.

I mean, is playing 12 innovative, cool games that are heavily hyped, but not really polished, really better than playing one well-polished game?<br/><br/>I think some of the problem the "indie" crowd have when they meet the "old-school" crowd actually stems from this. Why do both groups feel the others play in BadWrongFun ways?<br/><br/>We all know why the "indie" crowd cringes when they watch the old-skoolers.<br/><br/>But what about the old-skoolers? How do they see indie gamers? They probably see messy, awkward negotiations by a bunch of over-excited guys all going, "wow, look at how these mechanics are making story!" Compared to their fine-tuned, super-immersive, well-oiled roleplaying processes, full of delicate, artful speeches and flowery descriptions, with everyone on the same page, it must seem like some sort of horrible imitation of their "art".<br/><br/>I'm talking about those guys who get together and play a story game and get so excited about Story Now and all that, that they just skip through the game, moving from one conflict negotiation and die roll to the next, as fast as possible, leaving out the artful dialogue and beautiful narrations or character play that old-skoolers find to be the meat of the game.<br/><br/>I can see how that looks unappetizing to an old-school "immersive" roleplayer, whose group has been running the same system for 25 years and has got everyone on the same page.<br/><br/>(Edited for slight clarification of the text)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127418/#Comment_127418" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-18T21:36:51+00:00" title="February 18, 2008  9:36PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: VBWyrde</cite>How do I perfect the game I already love?</blockquote>\nActually, I came back (instead of going to bed) to discuss this very thing, and there you went ahead and posted it!<br/><br/>Here's what I love about discussing new ways to play and run games: Sometimes you end up looking back on the games you have and see them in a new light. <br/>Now, a lot of the time these developments in new ways to play and run games are attached to a specific new hippie super-focused game. But so what? I can play that game to suck up the idea, else I can read about the game and extract the idea that way.<br/><br/>Here's a real example of how my gaming go turned on its ear. I was talking to... I forget, I think it was Ron Edwards (talking about his spy game Spione). The idea of "situation" had been out there a little bit, in a game here or there. But it was specifically hearing him talking about the fact that in most role-playing games, they tell you to make up characters first. Then it's the GM's job to put all those disparate characters together and make a story out of it. It TOTALLY WORKS in squad-based games like D&amp;D or Dread: Pandemonium easily. In games where the job isn't to get the PCs to get together and kick ass while chewing bubblegum... well, things become more complicated.<br/>Anyway, his point was "when an author writes a story, she doesn't make up characters first (although she might for that old in-house TSR schlock fantasy crap). Instead, she comes up with a situation. From there, she starts creating characters that, y'know, fit in that situation. Protagonists, Antagonists, people with freedom, people trapped by the situation, etc". The idea is, why don't we try that with our tabletop roleplaying games? Y'know, just to see what happens. To see if that makes them more fun or interesting to play (it will depend on the person, of course).<br/><br/>I ran a game of L5R a few years ago, but it flopped because I couldn't get the Crab and Scorpion and Crane and Dragon to do anything together. And when they joined forces to slay an evil wizard, it felt really contrite, like they turned off their drama and backstories in order to go all D&amp;D on some wizard's ass. Same thing happened with a game of Aberrant: We had three characters that were so different from each other, I couldn't really do anything with them together that seemed fun or interesting. I thought at the time that the game flopped because one player totally min-maxed his character to be a psychic combat badass, but in truth I didn't give them much direction, or a campaign setup, with which to build their characters.<br/><br/>Cut to Last Year. The most successful game that we played, hands down, in our bi-weekly group was a game of With Great Power set in the world of the Night Watch. The players were all awesome and into their characters. And in fact, you build your characters first in that game. However, the whole scenario and enemy generation component of With Great Power basically sticks a needle into the spine of each character, pulls it out, dumps it into a petri dish, and from there creates a big fat capital-S Situaion. Things were afoot that were intimately related to the characters. The characters were all pawns in an inter-woven conspiracy that the players were helping define through their actions as they went along. It was great.<br/><br/>Likewise, I went back to L5R again. At one point I owned the core book for 1st edition and just about every splatbook for it (which I skimmed, ran, flopped, skimmed again for ideas, then sold). Now I simply own the core book. I came up with a Situation for the game first, an idea of the Big Problem that will be afoot, before even talking to the other players (in some hippie games the players all define the situation together): The Crab Wall falls, and the Shadowlands creep into the world of Rokugan. That's a big problem to deal with, and I have no clear idea of how the players will "win it" (or even if they can). After telling the players about the situation, they created characters that can easily fit in this situation, each with their own motivations and paths that will intersect or split due to how this whole Wall Falls situation progresses.  In two days will be our first play session (last session we decided to play L5R, I rolled out my situation, we made characters, and tested the combat engine briefly). I am excited as shit not only because I get to play what looks to be a wicked-sick campaign of a game I've had on my gaming shelf for effectively 9 years, but because the situation really hits my buttons, and L5R is a game that really can deliver (I think, anyway) when used in this way. <br/><br/>Situaion before Characters. A simple fucking little idea, but it hammered hard into my skull, and now I can pretty much go to any game book on my shelf that I played or haven't played, from Blue Planet (aka "Awesome game, but What are We Supposed to Do?") to Unknown Armies to Conspiracy of Shadows to Dungeons and Dragons to Shadowrun. New and interesting ways of looking at play is helping me get back into the games I've already had, without waiting for the New Hotness to come out.*<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>But as I mentioned elsewhere, I'm addicted to the New Hotness. Probably now more than ever. Because I can drink those new gaming ideas up, and perhaps use those new idea-gems to make my Blue Planet or Fading Suns game even better!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127419/#Comment_127419" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-18T21:38:12+00:00" title="February 18, 2008  9:38PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 18, 2008 9:50PM by Andy.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>Some people improve their play by trying new games and learning new techniques through mastery of new systems.

Because for me, anyway, 12 small games with cool ideas will exist out there as people write them. Now, I'm a busy guy. I won't be playing <b>ANY</b> of them. Maybe one or two, if a really good friend wrote it and was running it for me. But other people will find time to play them, and talk about their experiences. And I'll talk about those one or two games that I gave a shot. Between us, we'll have a bunch of reports about what makes those games cool. <br/><br/>The audience, the rest of us reading these blog and forum posts, can decide if that experience is something they'd like to try. Maybe it's not, and one of the other 11 games might be more interesting.<br/><br/>But in any case, people will be talking about the specific cool ideas that came out of the game that hit the player between the eyes with coolness. Stuff like the Psi Run "mysteries", the IAWA Oracle, the round-robin character generation of Inuma, the set phrases and negotiation of Polaris, the Zones and Spin in Spirit of the Century... and those ideas will be floating out there. Like ripe fruit waiting to be plucked.<br/><br/>Fruit that you can steal and turn into juice that you pour all over the games already on your shelf, to possibly make them more fun.<br/><br/>I see nothing wrong with enthusiastic people making small innovative games, which get hyped because they have some great ideas. That's more games to hear about, steal playing/running ideas from, and use in my old games. Just don't expect me to have played them all. Or any of them, for that matter. I may break down and play one or two (or five) in that next year.  But believe me, if we get through the year and hear about 12 mind-blowing innovative small press games, I'll probably be up for playing 2-3, and stealing game play ideas from the rest.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127420/#Comment_127420" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-18T21:39:01+00:00" title="February 18, 2008  9:39PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 18, 2008 9:42PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>...

His word are mostly directed to his needs and his feeling about games and the story-game community.<br/><br/>To be fair, the question put to CK last night from some of the game designers there was along the lines of "How can we [as a community of designers of independently owned games] make new games <i>for you</i> as a player and a GM that will excite you and communicate with you and give you what you want?"<br/><br/>I think CK's post above is an impressively concise recap of his answer to that question. Primarily that he doesn't need new game designs from the community. He is much more interested in how the community can help him in his quest for better play. <br/><br/>Edit: Bud nipping                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127423/#Comment_127423" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-18T21:44:41+00:00" title="February 18, 2008  9:44PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're right!

I have to ask.  Did I fuck you over at some point in some way that I've forgotten about?  Because I don't think you've ever shown up on a thread I've posted to in on any board without charging in like a drunkard with his pants down peeing on everything in sight.  And I mean it.  I'm asking.  What did I do to you?  Or do you just behave this way with everyone and I've just missed it?<br/><br/>But, to the point.<br/><br/>You're wrong.<br/><br/>TV shows answer a need. Movies answer a need.  Novels answer a need.  MMOs answer a need.  It may not be a need you value, so you dismiss it. But trust me -- for good or bad, but screwed up or healthy, there is a need and it's being met.<br/><br/>It's not the need of food.  Nor is a need you or a need I have, perhaps.  But if it was just about throwing money to the wind then one piece of nonsense would be as valuable as another and people wouldn't have preferences.  But if you believe, as I do, that one movie might meet the needs of many people more than another because of intrinsic properties and construction within the movies themselves, you might see why some movies do better than others, and why some movies do better than others in certain demographics.<br/><br/>Roleplaying games:<br/><br/>Here's why I used to buy games: I wanted to find a roleplaying game I wanted to play.<br/><br/>I don't think this notion is going to stun anyone -- though I expect you'll leap back with a dismissive, unexpectedly angry and oddly oblique comment that doesn't push anything forward much.<br/><br/>But for a lot of us, we bought the next game because the rules mechanics or the setting or something held out the promise we were going to be getting something that hadn't been at hand before.  I loved the idea of roleplaying games, but I seldom found the game I loved.  And by that I mean I seldom had the fun I wanted playing them.<br/><br/>Because the truth was, once I found a game that did what I wanted, I wouldn't have to buy another game.  <br/><br/>We know this phenomenon as well: tons of people all over the land playing homebrews and never buying a damned supplement again.  All they do is re-stock their d20's when they're worn down too much.<br/><br/>So, now, starting around the time I bumped into The Forge in 2002 I think it was, after years away from the hobby, I started finding the games<i> that gave me what I wanted to play</i>.<br/><br/>And now that I have several of them, I don't <i>need</i> to buy anymore. <br/><br/>Yes, other people will buy them. And their need for novelty, new ideas, purchasing as a sense of power or worth will be fed by those purchases.<br/><br/>But for me: I needed to buy and try games in the past because I wasn't getting what I wanted.  And now I have what I wanted.  And that need is filled.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127435/#Comment_127435" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-18T22:19:51+00:00" title="February 18, 2008 10:19PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, I agree with almost everything everyone's said here.<br/><br/>Except:<br/><br/>I wonder if part of the reason people are designing so many games is _because_ so many of the games aren't really playtested, polished, etc?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127438/#Comment_127438" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-18T22:25:05+00:00" title="February 18, 2008 10:25PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>I wonder if part of the reason people are designing so many games is _because_ so many of the games aren't really playtested, polished, etc?</blockquote>\nMaybe they just need to create, and since they personally like rpgs, that's what they create.<br/><br/>Simplistic?

I wish I knew. I will point folks to the most recent episode of the Virtual Play podcast, which shines a light on a moment of play in one of Bill White's SOTC games and examines it from several viewpoints. I think more of that kind of thing can help.<br/><br/>Also, are there things you're taking from story-games that are informing your current play. Having played with you, I know the answer is yes. Are there things that you've found that reliably do, and do not, work for you at the table? Maybe things that "should" work according to the pundits, but do not. That one's open to anyone. Those kind of questions seem pertinent to me.<br/><br/>As to the design v. play thing, I wouldn't mind so much if I felt that the designers were spending enough time perfecting their craft and creating something that is <i>primarily </i>intended to provide me, the player, with the tools to create a deep and gratifying play experience, and is presented in a way that maximizes my chance at doing that. As a player, too often, I feel that the design intent is to create a thing, and the players and their experience of the game is a lesser concern.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127457/#Comment_127457" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T01:05:03+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  1:05AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My confusion about this thread can best be summed up with this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>Change it to CK doesn't <i>want</i> new games.

CK's got the games he likes, he knows what he likes about them, and he knows what he's looking for (things that will make those four games even more fun for him).  I certainly have a list of games I like, and as I've said elsewhere, I think I'd be just fine if those were the only games I ever played again as long as I lived, because there's still so much left for me to do with them.  I would assume that the Hogwart's fangirls JDCorley alluded to are in the same boat with their forums and chatrooms -- they've GOT what they want/need, the only thing that'll interest them now is ways to make what they've got BETTER in some way.  Like CK and me, the little wizardesses are content and that's that.<br/><br/>So what's supposed to be the next step here?  An approving nod and general agreement that, yes, each of us likes the things we like and would enjoy finding ways to like those things even more?

And now I have what I wanted.  And that need is filled.<br/><br/>CK</blockquote>\nSnip.<br/><br/>This insight interests me a great deal, but specifically because I am on the opposite end from CK.  Until recently, GURPS and 7th Sea have been my primary gaming systems for the 10+ years that I've been roleplaying (although I have run and played [i]many[/i] other systems); however, I had recently come to a point where I wasn't getting what I wanted from the games I was running/playing in.  This actually started some time ago, as an annoying inkling, but I just blamed it on D&amp;D 3.5 kids and the wargaming aspects clashing with my "method actor" sensabilities.  This was exacerbated by a change of location and the loss of my long time gaming group.  I found myself looking for a new perspective in my gaming.  Something that would reinvigorate my gaming experience.  This, and the careful prodding from a friend or two, brought me to the "indie" or "story telling" gaming world.  These games, and I specifically call attention to SoC, HoB, and PTA, have provided me with that "need" and have revolutionized my thoughts towards how games <i>can</i> be played.  So I buy these games.  I will play as many of them as I can and as often as I can, but most importantly I will <i>read</i> them and learn from their sensabilities.  <br/><br/>Does this mean that I will leave behind CoC of GURPS forever and play only "indie" games?  No.  But I will most deffinitely use the particular elements that re-excited my gaming world in every game I run.  And, therefore, I will continue to buy and run "indie" games.  Not to mention that some of these games have rotated (if not replaced some games) into my "go to" game settings, like SoC (and the FATE system may be my new "go to" system).<br/><br/>In short, I needed something new in my gaming.  And I buy games for that reason, specifically "indie" games.  The result was that I am more excited about gaming now than I ever was (except maybe when I was 10 and I finally got ahold of a copy of Car Wars <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> ).<br/><br/>CK's comment, furthermore, provides a view into a future that I am hoping for.  A time when I don't <i>need</i> to buy games anymore, because I am content and happy with the games I have.  (But, as I compulsive buyer, I most likely will anyways.  Just can't help myself.)<br/><br/>And in regard to another aspect of his point:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite><br/>What I think we need is to learn to play <i>better</i><br/></blockquote>\nJust one note, I absolutely agree.  But to elaborate my above thoughts, I think the "indie" or "story games" facilitate this "need".  At least they do so for me.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>John                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127467/#Comment_127467" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T03:38:56+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  3:38AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I commented somewhere else (the thread about indie promotion?) I don't just buy new games to play, heck I've not played the majority of the games I own, I buy them to read, steal ideas from, admire the system, enjoy the writing, and all sorts of other factors that make them worth the money I spend, but are not to do with playing them.<br/><br/>For example I bought the Usagi Yojimbo game because I like UY. I wanted to see UY mechanics, and extra background, and story ideas. As it happens the game didn't work for me, but I still love it for all the other things. The same goes for, say, Nephilim, which I have no intention of playing, but from which I borrowed all sorts of concepts about magic to use in another game, run with GURPS.<br/><br/>So for me having the perfect game on hand for my style of gaming and my gaming group won't stop me buying new games at all <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>As for the design side, I design games because I can't not do.

Let's focus more on perfecting the craft of play rather than continual design (and especially with regards to many of these half-ass designs I've seen published/ashcanned and, unfortunately, bought by me in the past year and a half.)<br/></blockquote>\nA commonly accepted theme in this thread seems to be that of New Games versus Better Play, but that seems like a false dichotomy to me.  Continual design <i>is</i> focus on perfecting the craft of play.  Certainly it's not the only way to do so, but the idea that the two are at odds seems ridiculous.<br/><br/>By way of example, Dogs in the Vineyard was rightly esteemed not just because it was a new game mechanic("let's roll our dice pools before we start") or new situation ("we're latter day paladins in the wild west, that also deliver mail") but because it had tight focus on a type of play that was (presumedly in playtest) proven to work.  The GM advice of actively revealing the town, driving for and escalating conflicts and so on are <i>all about </i>answering this "need to play better."  And that's just the explicit stuff seperated into the advice chapters.  It was a designer saying "I've found a great way to play, here's how to do it" and making a game out of that is just as valid as discussing it in a forum, or at a convention, or what-have-you.  New design is by no means the only way of improving play, but I still think it's an important one.<br/><br/>With more and more indie games being released, you're obviously going to get more bad games along with more good ones, as is the case in any medium.  This is new, so it's easy to look at the increased number of mediocre games (especially those that <i>don't</i>, explicitly or otherwise, address better ways of playing, but rather just offer new mechanics and setting for their own sake) and become frustrated by the whole endeavour.  Thus the declaration that we don't need new games to achieve better play.  And we don't.  But they can help.<br/><br/>Ultimately new games don't necesarily promote better play, and you don't need better play to make new games, but simply because there's a disconnect doesn't mean the two are in opposition.  The best games tend to offer interesting ways of playing.  And some of the best advice on how to play better can be more easily demonstrated on systems designed specifically with that intent.  I can see wanting to get at the meat of better play without having to learn a whole game to do it, but likewise I can see wanting to improve your play naturally by playing a system that encourages it rather than reading discussions, advice, (heaven forefend) theory, or the like.  A lot of people seem to be arguing for one of these and against the other, whereas I think it comes down to personal preference, just as actual "better play" isn't really something a community can achieve together, but is rather something individuals need to come to on their own (by whichever means works for them).<br/><br/>I don't actually design games, so perhaps I'm assuming too much authority on what the "best games" or "best design" happens to be... such is why I normally just lurk, but I thought someone should answer the "rather than" statement in the above post.<br/><br/>-Adam                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127510/#Comment_127510" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T06:14:39+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  6:14AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2008 6:15AM by Andy.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite><br/>Seriously.

But, I don't have an answer, and I'm not sure it's avoidable outside of each publisher's marketing efforts and enthused people just playing games and having fun. That is, I don't think there's anything we creator-owned publishers "should" do about it.<br/><br/>Broadly speaking, the "too many games" problem will take care of itself. If we're saturated, some games will get left in dust. So it goes.<br/><br/>That's awfully easy to say. It's much less fun if, say, my pals have to learn it the hard way. Nevermind if I have to learn it the hard way! Shit!<br/><br/>Here are some other things I've been thinking about in reaction to this: <br/><br/>* I think we're several months out from seeing a whole new wave of games, many of which are from established creator-owned publishers. I think In A Wicked Age is the vanguard here; others will follow. I can name at least four right off the top of my head, and any of them could be a bit "hit." (They are: Galactic from that other Matt, Robots &amp; Rapiers AND Blood Red Sands from Ralph, Acts of Evil from Paul. There are several others I'm less well familiar with, and probably lots I don't know about, too.)<br/><br/>* I tend to think of games as amalgams of techniques built in such a way that they create an overall, often unique, social structure among the people playing them. (What a mouthful!) Also, we've seen a whole host of popular, new techniques arise from creator-owned games. (Some of these techniques aren't new, but it's the first time they've seen "print.") <br/><br/>Now, these things are "good tricks." We will see lots of these good tricks mixed around in various ways. Innovation of mind-blowing techniques will tend to fade. BUT, "innovation" of how these good tricks get put together and used in various ways will blow our minds all over again. <br/><br/>This is a great! It will help spread these ideas around. And, I hope, improve the fun-factor of the hobby. It expands the acceptable "norms" of what's fun. <br/><br/>Personally, that's where I see some, if not all, of my design and publishing efforts headed -- using the library of awesome ideas to re-package and re-realize cool new collections of techniques. They'll make for more reliable, more robust games, I believe. Can't wait!<br/><br/>This is all good stuff, sure. But, it still means we'll have a lot of games on our hands. <br/><br/>So, Christopher's observed concerns don't go away. In fact, they may worsen! I strongly agree that we've got so many games, that "older" games tend to go unplayed, and that means their innovations tend to get forgotten. Hopefully, a couple things could happen. One is that they don't actually get forgotten, anyway. Great! The other thing is that their excellent ideas still get "played" because another game repackages them smartly. Good!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127533/#Comment_127533" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T06:58:57+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  6:58AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>But if it was just about throwing money to the wind then one piece of nonsense would be as valuable as another and people would have preferences. </blockquote>\nWait, wait. What? People's preferences aren't just randomly pulled out of the air, so there's no way to reach this conclusion from my premise. That doesn't make any sense. "Because there's no need, just preferences, then anything's as good as anything else"? What now? How does that even remotely follow? I think my statement conclusively disproves this and you think I'm demanding it's true with pee and everything.

The mixture produces people seeing movies, and buying and playing roleplaying games, and all other leisure activities.<br/><br/>I am baffled by anyone seeing an attack or a threadcrap in my post.

The bolded version is how it should have read. I apologize about that, since it could only lead to great confusion.<br/><br/>If you were saying, "Me, too!" with your post... then I so clearly misread your post so badly that I can only say sorry.<br/><br/><br/>Max, <br/><br/>First, let me say quickly, I'm not against thinking about design or theory.  I do it all the time.  Design and theory produces the games that produce the play, so there's nothing wrong with that. <br/><br/>Strangely -- or not strangely -- I have found that playing the games that turn me on are the one's that teach me the most about play. <i> Everyone has their own list!</i>   I read Actual Plays over at The Forge (especially Ron Edward's games), and learn a lot from them.<br/><br/>For more than that, I'd have to think more on it.  I mean -- I'm <i>thinking</i> on it right now.  I only realized that I had sort of assembled the tools I needed -- almost by accident -- and now it was time to figure out what to do with them.<br/><br/><br/>Adam,<br/><br/>I don't think the New Games vs. Better play of play is a commonly accepted theme on this thread.  John tried to float it earlier, and I asked we nip it pretty fast.  Ian brought up something like it, but <i>not</i> the same thing at all.  Or, rather, I don't think it is.  I think he was saying, "<i>Just</i> publishing games isn't going to help anyway play better, and since a lot of games are coming out half-assed, it seems that <i>only</i> publishing is the focus."  I don't want to speak for him, though.  But that's how I read it.<br/><br/>There's a bunch of tangled stuff here: Writing/Designing a game at all; publishing a game; the needs of the consumer.  <br/><br/>In conversations I've read and listened to, what seldom gets mentioned (at <i>least</i> from what I've read and heard) is any discussion of what the consumer's interests might be.  I sort of think it's important for people entering this field from a producer's angle to consider that.... Okay... I'll fess up, I think it's invaluable.<br/><br/>Again, just because it's so tangled, I'll reiterate:  I'm not saying people shouldn't write and design games.  (As if I have any say over that anyway.)  We're talking about the needs of the consumers, so we're implying commerce here.  Okay?<br/><br/>I'm saying if you're going to <i>invest the time and money</i> into bringing something to market (something you obviously designed because you had a bug to design it anyway, but now you're bringing it to market) -- then before you invest your time and money you might ask, "How does this offer people something they need?"  (Some people will translate that to "want".  I like the word need.  I think it's more honest and is truer to the conversation I'm having.)  Because this consumer is saying, "Hey, I just realized I've got what I need."<br/><br/>I'd say for a while people needed new games just to figure out what was going on with all this indie stuff.  Speaking as ONE consumer (and thank you John Harper, for the pronoun body-check way upthread) I'm just raising a flag: My needs right now are fulfilled.<br/><br/>If I hear of a game that sounds like it does even better what I want to do, and I play it, and it does, I'll probably need to buy that game.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127613/#Comment_127613" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T10:21:16+00:00" title="February 19, 2008 10:21AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a business analyst, we talk about data and "intelligence." That is raw information in the first case, and data presented in such a way as to be actionable in the second. What you seem to have right now is a single data point. By itself... not much use. Now we can even extrapolate that you are not unusual, and that others, too, are satisfied for the most part with what they have in terms of RPGs. Fine... given what else you say about the subject, there's apparently still nothing to be done about it. For we who like to design. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo... I don't mean to dismiss your point at all, but I just don't know what anyone's going to do with it. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow if, in fact, it's a call to put more effort into craft than into making new games? Then I think you may have a point that's worth discussing. <br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps interestingly, I think that the majority of people who play RPGs are satisfied with the ones they have. Mostly D&amp;D, in fact. I am, in fact, very satisfied with Hero Quest, and have played it probably 90% of sessions for the last four years. I can understand why you could be satisfied with just that one, let alone four. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I personally am like Jack, in that I can't leave well enough alone. I like to design for designing's sake, with the hope of coming up with something even better. It's not a lack of contentment with play, but a desire to have fun by designing something new and better. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo (even if this is not your point, I'll address it anyway), why do I design, and not post about craft more? Well, first, I'd say that I think I split pretty evenly on this. For example, this article is entirely about my rationale for how I play Hero Quest, and how I think others might do well to play: http://www.glorantha.com/support/na_defeat.html<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that, generally speaking, folks who are designers are the same folks who give the best craft advice. In fact, I think it's the same sort of analytical outlook that makes one feel capable of design (making design more palatable) that often makes one capable of giving good craft advice. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut why bother making new games at all? Understanding, in fact, that most will probably fail miserably in terms of comparative amounts of play? My game Cell Gamma, which I happen to think is a pretty nifty idea, gets almost zero play. Did I think before I designed it that it would be the next D&amp;D? <br/>\n<br/>\nWell... maybe a tiny bit. Oh, probably not with Cell Gamma, really, but I think that every designer hopes perhaps to be somebody who creates the game that knocks off the giant. To be clear, I don't think this will ever happen. But it's fun to have it as a horizon to shoot for, even if unattainable. <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause, in fact, to create a phenomenon like D&amp;D, or Magic: The Gathering, requires tapping into whole levels of new "attractiveness" as an activity (this is why I don't think that any RPG will ever do it, BTW: you have to break the paradigm completely to find this new level). That's an amazing thing when it happens, and can leave you as the owner of GenCon. Which would be cool. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, given that I knew, intellectually that Cell Gamma wasn't going to be that paradigm-breaking game that reached such stellar heights, given that I knew that as part of an anthology, that I knew that it had only been playtested once (I've admitted this before).... given all of this, why would I bother creating the game? What good did it do me or anyone? <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I made some money on it. Oh, very little, to be sure, and nothing like what you'd want for 13,000 words from any "real" writing job. But I'm firmly in the black on it. This is the miracle of the "Forge" Model for publishing, that it's nigh impossible to lose any significant money on publishing, and you're almost guaranteed to come out at least a small amount ahead. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut is that it? I'm just out to bilk folks for cash with poor quality product? <br/>\n<br/>\nNo. I honestly believe that, however flawed you might like to call Cell Gamma, that the gaming community is overall better for it existing. In terms of actual play? Well in at least a couple of cases, folks have had fun with it. More importantly, however, I'd like to believe that the people who have run the game have learned from it some new techniques that become key to the game by it's design. In fact I have the hubris to believe that people even reading the rules and not playing have hopefully had their horizon's broadened by it. It's worth the couple of bucks that people have to pay for it as part of the anthology in which it is purchased. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs it worth more than 13,000 words of well-written craft advice? Nope, I think that people can and do publish craft advice for about the same amount (Push?). Could I have written it as 13,000 words of well-written craft advice instead, then? <br/>\n<br/>\nNo.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact the ideas for the techniques that I created for that game only came about in my head as part of the design effort. I didn't have the ideas ready, and then thought, "Hmm. I'll put those techniques into a RPG that incorporates them!" Rather the reverse. I had an idea for a game in general, and the techniques were invented as a result of figuring out how to make that game run well. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs has sometimes been said, a RPG has a duty to present at least one functional way to play it so as to have fun with the activity. Well, to that extent, every RPG design could be seen as a suggested package of techniques with which to play X sort of RPG. As such, they are all, in fact, craft advice - and nothing but that. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, does that mean that I think it's the best way to give craft advice? No. As you point out there is often a steep learning curve, and or structural problems that may occur with a design that may actually obfuscate the advice. So often it's better just to give more direct advice. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut just as often I think it's best to give advice in the context of an actual game design. Some techniques really can't be described well, but must be shown (the show-don't-tell principle). As such, I think that, for people like myself at least, a rule-set is the best way to learn certain techniques or ways to play. For instance, I didn't get most of the advice on how to run the sorts of games I like to run, until I ran Hero Quest. It was only having tools that reinforced the processes that I needed to be using that got me playing the way I that's best. <br/>\n<br/>\nOr, put another way, if you hadn't gotten your four games, you'd still be struggling, too. So it seems to be [i]prima facie[/i] true that new designs were important to you, too, in learning to better your craft. I mean... you wrote the Interactive Toolkit, but admit that you never really employed it well until you hit these games, right? <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, somewhere out there Levi is giving somebody some awesome advice that they are going to sorta agree with, but won't actually get (much less use well) until somebody designs the right game that shows them just how that advice is applied in play. <br/>\n<br/>\nContinued...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127614/#Comment_127614" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T10:22:45+00:00" title="February 19, 2008 10:22AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From above...<br/>\n<br/>\nI might even postulate that it's a cycle. We design new games - people come up with new techniques when playing these new games, ones which the games don't support all that well - so we design new games that support these techniques better - and players come up with new techniques as a result of playing those games that aren't well supported - and so on and so forth. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, this is more like R&amp;D than it is like production. But, then again, as I've said, I never really expected Cell Gamma to be a big seller. I expected it to just be another "gizmo" out there in the pool of gaming technology that exists, in the hope that it will be part of the gradual improvement of the art. <br/>\n<br/>\nThink of this community, perhaps, as a "Skunk-works." Sure the prototypes we make are often actually quite functional. But that's not the same as saying that they'll end up being the games that are most played., or that we expect them to. Note: even if they happen to be superior in some way to other RPGs out there, we don't expect that they'll be the most played. <br/>\n<br/>\nNot to stretch the analogy too far, but think of these games as research papers. Sure, some papers have a lot of practical application, but we don't expect that every one of them will become a standard part of the textbook that every student reads. Instead they simply serve to create a body of information from which bigger and better things might eventually be constructed. Some works more important than others. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm saying "We" a lot, but, of course, I'm making a lot of assumptions about other's motives. But I think this is Ken Hite's view of this community. He's always referring to the "Gnomes at the Forge" or something. And I think it's a useful viewpoint, too. At the very least it explains precisely why I'm involved. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, now that I've risked looking like I'm responding to an accusation that's been said hasn't been made, I'll risk even further, and probably be guilty of projection when I say: I often feel guilty that I don't read and play every RPG created. Heck, a lot of the proliferation of this sort of RPG can probably be blamed directly on myself and the advent of Game Chef (I hope I'm not sounding presumptuous). At this point, however, I don't even have time to READ a fraction of the games produced, much less play them all. Doesn't that mean that either they're not worth reading, or I'm not doing enough? <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, fortunately I understand the innate irrationality behind this. I have limited time, as does everyone. Just as no Doctor can read every medical paper written, nobody can read every RPG written. Much less play them. Even if we suspected that they were all worth play. Which we do not. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, again, as a body of knowledge held by an ever larger group of designers, I think that each and every design, even the blatantly failed ones, are of value to the community. Just as failed experiments are. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, you as a consumer don't need all the myriad R&amp;D games? <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's OK, we didn't design them for you. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs that the same as saying that we design these games not to be played? No. We design them for the folks who are like you were before you found, oh, Pendragon. Or just those folks who are always looking for something new. We've always admitted that it's a niche market. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127622/#Comment_127622" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T10:36:44+00:00" title="February 19, 2008 10:36AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I got my copy of Play Unsafe it struck me how you don't see a lot of books *about* gaming, as opposed to games.

I used to say that I made <i>My Life with Master</i> to show designers/publishers the kind of game I was wanting that they weren't making. But I eventually realized that wasn't the full story, and over time, the two reasons I design:<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The <i>My Life with Master</i> reason</span>: I want to play games that change the dynamics of creative collaboration in productive ways. PtA is a great game. And I've played it a lot. But as an architecture for creative collaboration it's the same every time. I learn about narrative, creativity, communication, and collaboration by experiencing games with different social structures for collaboration. So I think I'll always be looking for and designing games that provide different social structures.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The <i>Bacchanal</i> reason</span>: I'm not satisfied with my creativity or my play. <i>Bacchanal</i> comes from a recognition that I'm weak on using erotic content. I need games that put me in the position of having to train the abilities I'm weak at. I think I have lots of room to improve my prep skills, for instance. I think my characters when I play are often too internal, and as a result, not particularly compelling to watch. I think I'm better at playing antagonists than I am at playing protagonists.<br/><br/>The short answer is that I design games that push me into unfamiliar creative territory. And the games I get most excited about are ones where I can tell that the design came from the designer trying to personally grasp new collaborative or content territory himself.<br/><br/>Graham, Christopher, are you really saying that you're looking to enjoy the play skills you have, and that you don't see weaknesses you'd like to address, or new abilities you'd like to develop?<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127661/#Comment_127661" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T11:35:32+00:00" title="February 19, 2008 11:35AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2008 11:39AM by Ben_Lehman.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...<br/><br/>Chris, do you realize what a pompous ass you're coming across as here?<br/><br/>1) You fail to distinguish properly between want and need.<br/><br/>2) Saying things like "Yes, other people will buy them. And their need for novelty, new ideas, purchasing as a sense of power or worth will be fed by those purchases" means you're basically dismissing anyone who doesn' have exactly your interests and tastes as only interested in "novelty and purchasing as a sense of power and worth." Not, say, enjoyable play. That's arrogant in the extreme.<br/><br/>3) Saying things like "Because the new games (often met with great praise by people who -- as far as can tell -- have never played them) often have huge gaps in them and sometimes leave the players stranded in matters as blunt as conflict resolution." both reveals some intense ignorance about game design (not surprising, since you only play four games) and also a total contempt for anyone who likes anything that isn't in your set of four Chosen Games. Like the last point, your assumption is that anyone who does not have an exact image of your tastes is not interested in play, but in other superfluous things.<br/><br/>Let me give you an example: I've written three games, with some others on the way. Not a one of them uses anything remotely resembling standard conflict resolution. So of course, to you, any of my games are going to leave you stranded in the matter. That's not a flaw in the game text. Just like my games don't extoll how they are different from D&amp;D, they also do not extoll how they are different from Sorcerer.<br/><br/>Of course, no one ever plays any of my games, and anyone saying anything positive about them is simply a status-seeking neophile, because my games were published after 2004.<br/><br/>4) "I'm not saying don't design games, or don't publishing games. That's between you and God. I'm talking what is going to make the experience of play better at the table." Basically sums it up.<br/><br/>Actually, my publishing games is between me and the people who play my games (and, I suppose, God who is everywhere). So I don't really see why you're butting into it like some old ninny who wants to outlaw all sex except for the missionary position.<br/><br/>Let's be frank: I've devoted a huge chunk of my time and energy to "making the experience of play better at the table." You know where it is? In my games.<br/><br/>This is a pattern a lot on Story Games (and the Forge) where people post about "too many new games!" I don't even see how that's possible. I think that there's a few of things going on with these posts:<br/><br/>0) This person is a publisher, and simply trying to bully other people off the market. These people are idiots. Ignore them.<br/><br/>1) For a long time, if you had particular preferences for play, it was impossible to find a satisfactory game. Lots of games promised satisfaction, but very few delivered. Suddenly, there's a boom in games which will satisfy these urges! Wow! That's fantastic.<br/><br/>For some people, that's enough. Just satisfy the urge and they're like "why ever do anything else? Clearly this is the perfect game. There's no need to develop further." They castigate anyone who is trying to make the experience of gameplay smoother, more interesting, more developed. "I'm satisfied, why can you be?"<br/><br/>2) Some people have a strange status attachment to "knowing all the games." This was something that was possible around the Forge from 2001 - 2005, and I think that a lot of the status concerned people are those who were posting on the Forge during that time period. Any new game is a threat to their status, because it's another thing that they'll have to play extensively in order to "know all the games." Indeed, at this point, more indie games are being published than it is possible to fully play and enjoy: by the time you've played them to satisfaction, new ones have come out.<br/><br/>To this, I can only say: get over yourself. Give up on "knowing all the games," play the ones you have, and don't spite other people wanting new ones.<br/><br/>3) Neophiles who have to buy every new thing, just to have it. They get annoyed because, man, you gotta budget nearly a grand a year for that now, just to keep up on the indie games. Again, my advice is to find a different way to control your spending habits than trying to browbeat poor creatie people into not publishing.<br/><br/>You are not your bookshelf of indie games. You are not your comprehensive knowledge of everything ever demoed at GenCon. You are not your 1000-post count on the Forge. You are not your design track record. You are not your list of AP posts. You are not your play. You are a human being. Be kind to others. Don't act like their creative expression is harmful to you unless it really is.<br/><br/>Chris, you're a smart guy, and I'm sure you're trying to say something smart, but you seem so caught up in your curmudgeonliness I certainly can't ferret out what you mean.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127667/#Comment_127667" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T11:39:44+00:00" title="February 19, 2008 11:39AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2008 11:43AM by Graham.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, as ever, I'm unsure what I'm trying to say.<br/><br/>I think what I'm trying to say is:  I'm happy to learn about story structure, the Cthulhu mythos, listening skills, group dynamics and Shanghai in the 1930s.

I'm thoroughly a Story Now player as The Big Model defines it.  I pretty much need a game to be about addressing the problematic nature of humanity for me to really enjoy it.  Here's the thing, I've seen two strong approaches to this. <br/><br/>The first one I call the Fill In The Blank method.  Primetime Adventures and The Pool are in this category.  Basically at some point during setup you write down "what the game is about."  In Primetime Adventure's that's the character's Issue.  In The Pool that's whatever you pull out as traits.  Then the procedures of play allow you to hammer whatever it is you've written on the blank line.<br/><br/>The other major approach is the highly specialized approach in which the game picks a particular topic and then the entire design resolves around addressing that topic.  Dogs in the Vineyard, My Life with Master, It Was A Mutual Decision, and Spione are examples of this.  I personally much prefer this approach because I'm fundamentally selfish.  In PtA everyone might have a different Issue representing a particular slice of a larger whole.  I'm much more satisfied when everyone at the table is addressing the *same* issue and thus through play we ultimately learn something about where we all stand on that issue.<br/><br/>This leads in me a desire for more and more and more games because every time I notice a particularly interesting facet of the human experience, I want a whole game that just address *that* one thing and addresses it well.  I want the mechanics themselves to raise key questions.  I want my decision to cross off that trait, roll the d8 instead of the d10, and choose the red die over the blue die to carry just as much thematic and emotional punch as the narration that's attached to the application of those mechanics.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127678/#Comment_127678" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T12:07:53+00:00" title="February 19, 2008 12:07PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christopher: If you can't see the pompous and condescending attitude you're taking towards people who publish and play any games other than your "big four," seriously, you need to reread your own post as if it was written by someone else, with, say, "D&amp;D, GURPS, Harnmaster, and BESM" as the four games.

And now he wants to spend his time learning to play those four games better.  I don't think he's necessarily saying "And these four specific games are all anyone should ever need."  What he's asking is, "Once you've found a game or two that give YOU whatever YOU need whatever THAT may be, why do you keep buying/designing new games?  Why not just practice at playing those games?"<br/><br/>To that question, I've given my answer above.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>I Don't Need Any More Games - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5700/i-dont-need-any-more-games/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="I Don't Need Any More Games - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5700/i-dont-need-any-more-games/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Dude, Ben, what the fuck?

Maybe we can get back on the train to Zen Town?]<br/><br/>Now that I'm less unexhausted after the con, I'll chime in with my thoughts.  First of all, I think it should be noted that I was the chief guy in said bull session above that flat-out asked him:  "CK, what can we do <em>as game designers</em>* that could help fill your need?"  (*Specifically referring to the four game designers who were in the room, not as a general comment.)<br/><br/>The eventual answer, after some animated (I wouldn't say "heated") back and forth was "Maybe there's nothing you can do."<br/><br/>I still hated hearing that answer.  I completely accept that it's <em>probably</em> the case for CK, but part of being a game designer, for me, is similar to being a software engineer -- my job is to fix problems.  Being told I can't do anything about something drives me to find a way to do something.  So, right now I'm spending a lot of brain cycles thinking about this.<br/><br/>I accept that "I can't solve his problem by publishing a new game," but (to call on another theme of that long discussion) <em>that doesn't mean I won't try.</em>  And maybe CK just will never be in my target audience -- that's cool.  But I'm taking this as a call to arms to personally infuse a conversation about the craft of play in my games (regardless of how I choose -- and if I choose -- to publish and maybe even sell them).  After all, CK knows what he wants, and maybe he'll never be interested in what I produce, but he's not the only one to think about this; it's those folks that I might be able to better serve.<br/><br/>So, yeah, I hate the answer as a designer, and to parts of this thread.  My response to this answer will be to step up and bring my A game to my future games, because me just bitching about it solves nothing.  That, and part of why I hate it is that, frankly, part of me <em>fucking agrees with him</em> and is making me question why I should put energy into making my own games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127694/#Comment_127694" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T12:40:19+00:00" title="February 19, 2008 12:40PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2008 1:25PM by Andy.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two rules for this thread, from this point on:<br/><br/>1) Read charitably.

I have a big ole' shelf of indie games and when friends come over I might say "Hey, how about a Prime Time Adventures one shot?" or "Have you played Don't Rest Your Head?  Let me show you."  I might even schedule a mini campaign or what not.  The amount of effort to relearn the majority of those games is tiny, and I love having so many great games that I can just pick up and play depending on my mood.  Some friends recently asked how long it would take me to put a one shot together and, looking at my indie shelf, I replied "I'm ready to run right now."<br/><br/>I don't have any trouble learning games, though.  I've found most RPGs to be 90% clear (or better) from the first reading, with a rare few that I have to go back over.  I have to spend some time learning the ropes of a video game, board game, CCG, or any other game as well.  That's part of the fun of it all for me.<br/><br/>jenskot mentions wanting to see more revisions.  I completely agree, so long as the initial game quality remains decent enough.  As a consumer I'd love to see a Don't Rest Your Head Revised (with mostly more setting stuff / GM support), Super Dictionary of Mu, Legends of Alyria 2nd Edition, and whatever else the talented RPG authors out there want to further develop.  But then, I'm happy to see new games, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127702/#Comment_127702" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T12:51:21+00:00" title="February 19, 2008 12:51PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="image" src="http://www1.istockphoto.com/file_thumbview_approve/879719/2/istockphoto_879719_stack_of_new_books.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127703/#Comment_127703" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T12:53:28+00:00" title="February 19, 2008 12:53PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>Part of me <em>fucking agrees with him</em> and is making me question why I should put energy into making my own games.</blockquote>\nMaybe you should do it because they're cool.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~youson/images/lamprey.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127704/#Comment_127704" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T12:54:43+00:00" title="February 19, 2008 12:54PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            CK, I suggest you immediately do penance and buy a grip of games you know you don't need.

I think a lot of interesting thoughts have been thrown around here already, and the few harsh posts are just too bad.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>I look at most of my inide game purchases like board game purchases.

I buy tons of story games, just as I buy tons of card games, and board games. I simply love games, and love fiddling with and mastering new techniques and systems. I don't really agree with Jens on learning how to play in 30 minutes though. For me it's more like several days of digesting the text, ripping it apart, pulling out the system from all the fluff and examples, putting together some decent play aids, and then being ready to play it at the drop of a hat.<br/><br/>I am very concerned with making people, and especially my friends, happy. Making people happy pleases me immensely, and is the core of my being. For me, I want to find the perfect game for each and every occassion. I definitely buy new games with certain people in mind that I want to play just that one particular game with. I also like being able to give my friends lots of choices when it comes to what games to play.<br/><br/>I also agree with Jens in regards to new editions of games. Probably my favorite game at this time is Dust Devils Revenged. I never quite groked the first edition. I found it intriguing, but could never understand quite how to play it. I tried to apply all the backstory advice from Sorcerer, but it still didn't quite work for me. Fast forward a couple of years, after having played Primetime Adventures and a lot of Dogs in the Vineyard, I pick up the new DD edition and am blown away. I played it and loved it! It's so great to see a designer go back and update his design. I can see where Matt found out through years of play and feedback, how to get the play out of his game that he designed it to produce, and now he could put it in words easily understood by his audience.<br/><br/>This brings me back to Andy's post in which he touches on how he learned about the importance of situation. It was Dogs in the Vineyard that first made me understand the concept of situation, but I was still unable to apply it to other games. Until Dust Devils and Daniel Hosterman's unbelievably cool and explosive situation "Three Days in Hell!" totally rocked my world.

I suppose it'll definitely make me pause before I sell a game, though.  But then, I'm already at the "I like designing games.  I'm going to think twice, three, four times before I sell one, and make sure it's as complete of a product as I can make it for folks like CK, if he decides to dabble in a new game (after all, others who pick it up will benefit from that)."

Is everybody coming off crystal meth today or what? <br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose I can see where some of the rancor comes from. CK kind of walked into a United Autoworkers meeting and suggested that we may not need so many new cars right now...but DAMN! There are some hotheaded responses to a relatively benign post extolling the good stuff we have, and suggesting (rightly or wrongly) that perhaps focusing on what is in front of us instead of racing towards the new would be a productive change of state for some. <br/>\n<br/>\nBen, I like your games, but you got kinda scary here buddy. <br/>\n<br/>\nCK, probably jumped on JD a little hard yourself. I didn't really get much from his comment, but no need to trash what was essentially a blip of a post. <br/>\n<br/>\nGraham, love the Sound of Music pictogram. Fantastic. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy take on the subject at hand? I buy more indie games than I play. They interest me, sometimes more in reading them than actually playing them. I found many good ones that fascinate me. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut...CK is dancing around something. Movies are things I watch once and if I love them will watch a couple more times a year, tops. Books, the same. Television series I will follow if they engage me enough, without repeated viewing. Bands I like, I will buy their albums, put them on my ipod, and they will slowly, gradually drift their way down my playlists. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut these are small, passive investments. I don't risk anything but a modicum of time, parceled out in bite size chunks. Relatively little effort is required on my part. <br/>\n<br/>\nRPGs on the other hand require brainpower. You have to figure them out. If you want to GM one, you have to really have a good idea how they work and what they are about. Then you have to gather people together, get their buy in, etc. The meatier the game (or the more obtuse in some cases), the more work. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs such, games are differently consumed, if they are truly to be played and not just collected, read, and placed on a shelf. And my expectations of games is different too. I do not want to buy a game and play it just once. And given the amount of time I personally have for gaming, that can quickly become a tough hurdle to clear. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know I am not telling you anything you don't already know, but on a certain level I understand where CK is coming from. <br/>\n<br/>\nLooking at the IPR racks at Gencon, demoing nearly everything at the Forge, and buying 5 ashcans, I still buy games, but I am really searching for the right one...or four. Personally I have not found them. Maybe one or two of my ideal four. But I do feel that if I could get four that I would immerse myself in and replay endlessly, it would be pure bliss. <br/>\n<br/>\nCongrats CK, I envy you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meghatron" title="Meghatron"><img alt="Meghatron" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/banfennid/pic/0004htf9"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meghatron">Meghatron</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127736/#Comment_127736" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T13:29:49+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  1:29PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was also in the late-night conclave, and while I tend to lurk around here I feel like there's another perspective that is a blend of the two extremes, a perspective that happens to be mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a list of games that make me happy, that satisfy my itch.  As someone who is driven to make stories, however -- so much so that I chose it as my profession -- a *separate* need I have is finding new ways to tell those stories, which is why I am interested in new games.  So, Ryan, I say to you that the effort is very much worth it, for consumers like me if not for CK.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut here's the key word, one that I think you and I both agreed on Sunday night: EFFORT.  I work more than one job, I have a long commute; my time is very precious to me.  And in the glut of indie game publication the last couple of years, there has been a decline in the quality of both texts and mechanics.  NOT together, mind you: some texts have great mechanics that are not explained well, and some games have great explanation with frustrating mechanics.  And given how precious my time is to me, there is nothing that can kill my interest in new games more than a game that is hard, confusing, or unsatisfactory to play.  And, for the record, I see those things as distinctly different from games I simply don't *like* to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo back to the effort.  Designing and writing a game are two very different skill sets (if not more, as suggested by Paul at the con), and if you do not excel at both, you *must* be willing to put in the effort to make up for the area in which you lack.  There is a distinct air of blind support in this community, with little push for or acceptance of constructive criticism (something which is understandable, given that one of the origins of the indie community was as a refuge), but as the creation of independent games is clearly moving from a Golden to a Silver Age, keeping the interest of someone like me in new product is going to require dedication to the craft.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't design.  I play, and I playtest, and I edit.  And I've seen, more than once, how a game that someone thought was nearly perfect was blown up by just one more playtest.  It's a fine line between "It's almost there and I just need to edit the rules myself" and "It's almost there and I need more people to play it."  One is easy, the other requires effort.  Then on top of that, the writing itself.  It's an equally fine line to give the latest draft to someone who's already played it to see if they understand, and someone who's never seen a single word.  Again, time and effort.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut believe me, it's worth it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127742/#Comment_127742" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T13:42:39+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  1:42PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2008 1:43PM by Denys.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The perception, right or wrong, is that better play comes out of better design.

(<a href="http://www.rpg.net/oracle/essays/itoolkit1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rpg.net/oracle/essays/itoolkit1.html</a>)  Ron himself says he was originally inspired by those articles to writer Sorcerer and I'm firmly convinced the most ardent indie-movement folks would be right now playing with a drama-point hack tacked onto Gurps 4th if it wasn't for CK.<br/><br/>Now, after all these years, CK is saying something along the lines of ....let's slow down with the design innovation and see if we can focus on play innovation.  Karmically, it feels right that CK is the one to say this.  He earned it.<br/><br/>Can we please get past the hurt feelings and acrimony and figure out a plan on how to focus on better playing rather than simply better design?

No one is saying, "you cannot design games for your own creative outlet!" However, it does bug me to buy crap (totally not pointing fingers at anyone in particular).

I don't mean to dismiss your point at all, but I just don't know what anyone's going to do with it.</blockquote>\nIt was pointed out that the question asked was about what <i>designers</i> can do with it.  The answer (as was also pointed out) might be nothing.  That doesn't mean that nothing can be done, just that what can be done isn't design.  And then a bunch of people went apeshit -- EVERYTHING MUST BE DESIGN, DAMNIT!  Well...no.  Yes, System Matters, yes, design is cool.  It's one of the triad of theory, design, play, and they're all good and valuable and important.  No one wants to take away your hobby, if design is the thing for you.<br/><br/>None of that blunts the point: there are things that can be done to make a specific game work better.  Compare a good D&amp;D game from back in the day with a bad one.  See?  And when we, as players, go flitting from game to game, it's very possible never to find the balance necessary to make any particular game work well.  Designers can't change that really -- making less games wouldn't even do it.  If something changes, it's got to be on the play end, and Chris is telling you what change he's realized he can make.  It's also possible that without playing a variety of games, we'd never find the way to make any of them work.  So, again, it's a balance.  All things in moderation.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>I think that, generally speaking, folks who are designers are the same folks who give the best craft advice. In fact, I think it's the same sort of analytical outlook that makes one feel capable of design (making design more palatable) that often makes one capable of giving good craft advice.</blockquote>\nTheorists give some good advice too, from time to time.  Of course, I'm biased, but seriously -- theorists and designers and players all give some pretty good advice from different perspectives.  I find them each of those perspectives useful in different ways.  The huge hard-on for design is great, but sometimes it does seem to distract from the other two.  All important, all cool, but...I wish there was enough love to around, and I think there just might be.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite>Graham, Christopher, are you really saying that you're looking to enjoy the play skills you have, and that you don't see weaknesses you'd like to address, or new abilities you'd like to develop?</blockquote>\nCan't speak for them.  My take: The point in focusing in a bit more on a couple games is exactly to improve skills and remedy weaknesses.  Moving from game to game all the time can camouflage them a bit -- you can blame them on the system rather than yourself.  When you find something that doesn't work and you stick with it and find ways to <i>make</i> it work, that usually has a positive impact on play skills.

There are far, far fewer of them available than there are board games but you don't ever hear boardgame folks crying that there are "too many" board games. <br/><br/>I mean, I do think there's a different level of...I don't know, maybe identity...between an RPG and its players. But they're cheap, they may just get a play or two, and so what?<br/><br/>Perhaps there's an unspoken ideal of objectively great roleplay, some standard that all gamers and designers "should" strive for. I wonder how that came to be? I don't hear the same sentiment among (again, sorry) board gamers. I dropped $80 on Starcraft: the Board Game, got several evenings of play out of it (with about the same amount of setup and play time as I get out of a good evening of Lacuna or DitV), and feel like I've gotten my money's worth. No sense that I should be playing S:tBG "better." No standard of play against which I measure myself.<br/><br/>Can you imagine the screaming if someone offered an $80 RPG and "only" got a few evenings of play out of it?<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127818/#Comment_127818" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T17:08:30+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  5:08PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 20, 2008 1:34AM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, thanks for the board game analogy.

In many, many cases though, the authors of games passed the responsibility of understanding this and communicating this to the reader.  The books provide you with the rules for the game, but not how to truly use those rules.  So, I can totally see CK wanting to play the games where he understands the rules already, understands some of the "how to" through his own experiences and feels he has more he wants to explore.  (If this sounds like a slight change from above, it's because I've come to terms with both being an indie designer and agreeing with CK.)<br/><br/>In some senses, I'm coming at this from the other direction:  I like this play thing I do, but am unsatisfied with the tools I've been presented for doing X sort of game.  I'm making the toolset that's more ideal for the sort of play I like to do (at least with epic hero fighting dragons thing for Mythender), and am trying to make it broad enough so that it works in many, many different situations (i.e. many different people I'd like to play with).  To be fair, it's not just that -- I also like fucking with mechanics and solving problems -- but that's a tangent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127871/#Comment_127871" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T21:48:35+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  9:48PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2008 9:50PM by Max Higley.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>Perhaps there's an unspoken ideal of objectively great roleplay, some standard that all gamers and designers "should" strive for.

If, in fact, that's why he hasn't responded to me (or just because it wasn't worth responding to), that's just fine. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am not saying, "Don't put out advice, only publish." Nor has even Ben said that. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is like the UAW analogy to an extent, but the subtext of what Chris is saying may rankle. Now, of course, our biases may mean that we're putting in subtext that Chris doesn't intend. But one of two things seems true:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Chris' message is meaningless to designers. He's kinda backed off here, it seems, and this seems to be his current position. Like, "I know it doesn't mean anything to you in terms of what you'll do, but I thought I'd tell you that I don't need any new games." Uh, OK.<br/>\n<br/>\nor<br/>\n<br/>\n2. The subtext of what he's saying is, "You write too many games, and should put more effort into writing advice for the games that do exist." <br/>\n<br/>\nMy response to 1 is, again, Uh, OK. My response to 2, in case anyone happens to be saying that or thinking that, is that I think we're doing the right proportion now. I'm not seeing anything being presented that would change my mind on the proportion. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that I specifically say (perhaps I wasn't clear) that we do at this point do as much advice as possible with our writing time. If you read me, I'm saying that the game designs are a neccessary part of that process. Or so it seems to me. I could well be wrong, and you can argue those points with me. But I do not at all propose that designs are the only way to improve the gaming world. That would be preposterous. Consider that I have probably 200,000 words published or something like that, and more than 5,000,000 words in online fora discussing play advice and such (yes a lot of this is also design advice, but sometimes its very hard to draw the line). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe advice side is getting the landslide of the effort already, I think. And that's probably as it should be. I just don't think that the amount of effort going into designing RPGs is having any deleterious effects on people's current propensity to give out advice. There's far more advice out there, in fact, than any person could possibly effectively absorb. At this point the important part of the massive nature of the available advice is that it causes the cream to rise to the top (uh, some people's blogs are better linked, for instance). Taking some proportion of design effort and shifting it to writing advice won't change that rate of rise at this point, I don't think. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhereas what you risk losing, by getting away from lots of designs is the innovations that come about as part of that process. For whatever they might be worth. Your mileage will vary tremendously here, of course, but we're servicing all of the RPG community, not just Chris Kubasik. Chris isn't asking that we bend soley to meet his needs, he's just providing his one data point. And, again, I assume that he's in the majority, and, again, I assume that we should try to meet his needs. <br/>\n<br/>\nLike, I think, we do now. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere's an idea that might be a ton more productive: if you want advice on how to better run Game X, then by all means have a thread asking for that. I am sure that you'll get quality feedback. I'm sure that starting a ton of threads like this would be a far more effective way to get people to give you said advice than infering that they cease designing RPGs, and focus more on advice unasked for. <br/>\n<br/>\nLevi has a whole site devoted to this subject: http://gamecraft.7.forumer.com/index.php<br/>\n<br/>\nI find it interesting that iGamecraft is only sparesely attended. You'd think that if people thought that there needed to be more focus on advice, that they'd go over to that site to try to obtain it, discuss it, etc. I've been over there, trying to avidly post, but it's hard to keep it up when there seems to be few people reading. I think that supply is meeting demand. If you want more demand for advice, then demand more actual advice. Don't try to shift the market by just saying you think it should shift. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127929/#Comment_127929" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T06:42:10+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  6:42AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Jeff">@Jeff</a>: ^_^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127933/#Comment_127933" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T06:54:53+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  6:54AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike: Hey, yeah cool.<br/><br/>Can't speak for CK -- the thing I thought about while reading his post was about where players spend their time.  In other words, not about a market at all, nor about what designers do, nor necessarily about a demand for published advice.  Just a desire to improve one's own skills.  Some aspects of doing that are harder when you play a bazillion games a year, each for a short period of time.

Ask my players, they'll tell you about my occasionally completely lackluster performances. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, I think you could say that I design in part to try to create systems that make up for my own personal inabilities. Stuff that I've only ever seemed to be able to overcome through system/mechanics, and not through technique on any other level that can be solved with simple advice. Having searched out the best advice that I can find for HQ, and having researched it deeply, I still am only so good at running it. <br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps that's why I'm designing a replacement? Yes.

Then whatever you find yourself playing, it oughta be reasonably doable to find a way to do it better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128188/#Comment_128188" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T16:59:51+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  4:59PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I have this other perspective on it...<br/><br/>I don't want to get any new games, because I have about six or seven games that I haven't played enough yet, and I won't even be able to fit those in. It's nothing to do with what is available (I'm sure I could quickly find plenty more that I'd like) but just that I only have a limited amount of time to play and so extra games would just sit on the shelf. Maybe even making puppy eyes and saying "please play me".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5700/i-dont-need-any-more-games" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5700/i-dont-need-any-more-games" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/5700/i-dont-need-any-more-games/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F5700%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F5700%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
