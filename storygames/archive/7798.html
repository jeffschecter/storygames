What is the relationship between the Nightmares and the City Slumbering?  Why don't they just take over?  Why don't you hear more news stories about people being attacked by clockwork cops?  Are they intentionally secretive?

For example (all invented at the moment, all alternative interpretations):<br/><br/>* The nightmares cannot sustain themselves for long in the City Slumbering: Mad City is just their natural habitat. This poses interesting questions about the Awaken, too: will you be able to ever return to your "normal life" once Awaken? Or are you tied to Mad City? Will resolving your issues and returning to sleep cure you, or will you *need* to return to Mad City?<br/><br/>* The nightmares are much less powerful in the City Slumbering<br/><br/>* The nightmares can only easily affect the awaken: except for rare cases the Residents got there by chance, not taken by the nightmares (case in point, "stealing" District Thirteen took pretty big mojo).<br/><br/>...or something else <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172966/#Comment_172966" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T14:10:20+00:00" title="October  3, 2008  2:10PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was just today leafing through DLYM while waiting for a game to start, and I stumbled upon the Jesus-power under... Stigmata? It envisioned that the character would ultimately turn into the <i>Second Coming</i>, a Nightmare that would provide access and substance for the Nightmare population of the Mad City in the City Slumbering, enabling just this sort of massed invasion.<br/><br/>Of course, that's a throw-away line, but I can imagine how an individual campaign might work with something along those lines. Myself, I've kinda assumed that as is often the case in urban fantasy of this sort, there are all sorts of unspoken rules and regulations in place, not to speak of the simple fact that the inhabitants of the Mad City might not <i>want</i> to conquer the world - or that they even know of the existence of the real world in any way we'd understand!<br/><br/>Speaking for how I'd probably run it as a GM, I'd latch on the unknown nature of it all and simply not worry about anything that's not pertinent to the actual situation in play. I'd probably portray each individual Nightmare with its own individual abilities and motivations as regards influencing the City Slumbering: one of them might have some association with mirrors, thus being able to cross over through any such. Another might require some frivolous ritual, like saying its name thrice in darkness, for it to come in and start a rampage. Another might just be reticent and perhaps even afraid of men with guns. Yet another might have a cult in some real-world location. The net effect is that the real world goes on its merry way, but there is no actual moratorium on interaction in particular cases.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172975/#Comment_172975" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T14:23:50+00:00" title="October  3, 2008  2:23PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha!

It would be more efficient for wolves to eat grass but that's not how wolves are. Which I entirely just made up, but like.<br/><br/>An urban fantasy bit I use for Shadowrun and like for DRYH as well is that those who notice strange things are in turn noticed by the strange things, so it's dangerous to pay attention, and you're not doing anyone a favor by asking them for help with the strange things that are after you. My thanks to the excellent movie "Fallen" for inspiring that turn of thought.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf" title="Bailywolf"><img alt="Bailywolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf">Bailywolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173080/#Comment_173080" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T20:23:38+00:00" title="October  3, 2008  8:23PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's no clear border between Slumber and Madness- the Awake warp and distort the boundaries, their awareness a bridge.  They can see the monsters, and the monsters can see them.  Weird shit bleeds through, but it bleeds through because of the Awake- they're a knife stabbed through the hand, into the table.  Nightmares have a warped consciousness- they're knots of perturbed perceptions, compulsions, and ticks- whether they're even aware of the Slumbering City is a toss.  What's far more significant (in a teeth at your throat kind of way) is that they're aware of <i>you</i>, they're outside your door, they're coming in, what are you going to do?<br/><br/>And if someone pays too much attention to the man with the bleeding hands or the ventriloquist dummy that seems a little too animated, well... it might be the sort of thing that disturbs them so bad, it keeps them up at night... <br/><br/>-B                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
