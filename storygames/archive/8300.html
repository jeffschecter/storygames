There's just one thing bugging me a bit: the typical story structure seems to rely on the party having a confrontation with a group of armed humans somewhere in act II, both to punctuate the investigation with some stabbing, and to wear down the party's resources a bit for their final showdown with the demon.  But this means that in practice most adventures have at least one, if not two, military or paramilitary organizations.  Feds, cops, cultists, gangs, neo-nazis, terrorists, and the generic syndicate (I love organized crime in stories when it has character and a sense of place/history, like the Barksdales in the Wire, or the Vor in Eastern Promises, but generic mafia like in A History of Violence tends to irritate me).  Disciples will run through these groups pretty quickly, especially those that give them a lot of trouble; most will only last a single session.  This will quickly make any setting, even a theoretically nice town or city, feel like a place where the rule of law has completely broken down.  I also worry that it will detract from the more personal scale of the tragedies demons create.  That said, I think armed human opponents are an important part of Dread, for both narrative and mechanical pacing.  It seems like the easiest solution is just to find some settings for Dread where the presence of armed factions in a large number of stories feels completely natural.  The whole world is being attacked by demons, after all.  So, where would you set a Dread game to normalize the paramilitaries/armed groups, and who would they be?  Mexico, where drug gangs dump human heads in nightclubs?  Somalia, wracked by civil war?  Bonus points if you can link to an article or two that helps give a feel for the setting.  I'm curious if there is a good part of America to do this in.<br/>\n<br/>\ne.g.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfganistan<br/>\n<br/>\nAfganistan may be a warzone, but it's full of people just trying to live their lives.  An hour's drive can take you from a town wracked by graft, corruption and crime, to one chafing under draconian religious law, to one torn between the Taliban and the West.  So many flavors of human misery are like a delicious buffet to the demons.  Whether the disciples are western troops mistrusted by the people they're trying to save, or Afganis fighting against the enemies of all mankind, they'll have their work cut out for them... <br/>\n<br/>\nFactions - there are far more than one could possibly use:<br/>\n<br/>\n-The Taliban.  They once ruled Afganistan, but their subjects were happy to get rid of them.  Now they are being welcomed back in many places simply because they maintain the rule of law, but the puritanical Taliban are finding themselves forced to make uncomfortable compromises for the privilege.  And where the Taliban are, their Al-Qaeda allies are free to operate.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-Warlords and bandits. They get their money from the poppy crop and their arms from us (or at least they used to); the central government is completely unable to control them - will the Islamists have any better luck?  Some Warlords run their own islamist groups, while others are more interested in territory and crime.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Tribal militias.  They've lived in the harsh countryside for milennia, and are no stranger to fighting.  They have no love for the US, the Taliban, or the Pakistani government.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Coalition troops.  Their weapons and armor are advanced, but they stick out like sore thumbs.  The air force has made many enemies for the men on the ground through destructive bombing campaigns.  Their mission is just but they have their hands full just protecting their Afgan allies from assassinations and terror attacks, and sometimes it's hard even to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Foreign fighters.  They've come to fight the west in the name of God.  The nationalist factions in Afganistan have little interest in more foreigners, though, so they wage their own battles.<br/>\n<br/>\n-The government.  By and large the central government is corrupt, impotent, and has little influence outside the capital, but it still has police and soldiers, for good or for ill.<br/>\n<br/>\n(distilled from http://tomdispatch.com/post/175010/anand_gopal_making_sense_of_the_taliban )                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183192/#Comment_183192" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-13T12:09:28+00:00" title="December 13, 2008 12:09PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sadly, I think the majority of the planet could easily handle this.  <br/><br/>For Mexico, Richard Grant's travelogue <i>God's Middle Finger</i> is excellent and terrifying source material.  <br/><br/>For the United States, certainly the Mexican border is experiencing accelerating lawlessness.

I think that Jason and Kobayashi have pretty much nailed it.<br/><br/>But here's something to consider -- in Pent (a sourcebook for Dread), the hostiles include:<br/>- Con artists<br/>- Cultists<br/>- Victims of demonic possession<br/>- Security guards<br/>- A SWAT team<br/>- Cartel gunmen<br/>- DEA agents<br/>- Looters<br/>- Lynch mob<br/>- Assassins<br/>- Yakuza gunmen<br/>- Dirty cops<br/>- Terrorists<br/>- NSA operators<br/>- Secret Service agents<br/>- AWOL soldiers<br/>- Bank robbers<br/>- Ecoterrorists<br/><br/>... and so forth. FYI, about half of this book is available for free: <a href="http://www.neoplasticpress.com/files.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.neoplasticpress.com/files.html</a><br/><br/>So anyhow, as you can see, not all of these groups are armed criminal factions. Cultists make for a great diversion, as do riot-crazed looters, drunken lynch mobs, or victims of demonic possession (see section 12.4.3. for information about the way that Stalkers can possess crowds). And, of course, you've got people who look like good guys, but ain't, like dirty cops, or soldiers who sell stolen guns to gang members. So there's quite a bit of variety, actually.<br/><br/>But man, I am loving your take on it. Taliban, tribal militias... terrific. Personally, I'd take a quick flip through some John le Carr\xe9 novels for inspiration. Constant Gardener, Absolute Friends, Mission Song, any of those should fill your head with some unpleasant thoughts and setting information for an international Dread session.<br/><br/>Here's some more ideas atop your pile:<br/><br/>OMON (seriously, look these guys up, they're amazing, perfect villains for a Dread game)<br/>FARC (great fun)<br/>Coltan-mining central African warlords<br/>Pro-Soviet East European extremists<br/>Basque secessionists<br/>\xd3glaigh na h\xc9ireann<br/><br/>As for settings, there are a whole hell of a lot of brushfire wars going on right now (tragically). <br/><br/><a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/index.html</a><br/><br/>I am keenly interested to hear how your session goes! Please check in with us at the Dread forums, if you get a chance, and tell me about your gaming experience. Hell, you've given me a couple of ideas that I'll have to try in my next game.<br/><br/>Pax vobiscum,<br/>Rafael                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183235/#Comment_183235" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-13T16:37:31+00:00" title="December 13, 2008  4:37PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>The thing about Dread is that it's kinda like the World of Darkness, only like thaaaaaaat much darker.</blockquote>\nWhy, thank you!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>So there's no reason for gangs, especially organized ones, to be running around in your part of North Carolina, France, or Isesaki.

Lots of planning, lots of grief if a plan goes awry, etc.<br/><br/>In Dread, the people being controlled or influenced are usually already scum of the earth. It's not like all the PCs are going to go all psychopath and blow them all away to get to the baddie as if they were zombies. Yet, it's not like the thought of breaking a few eggs is totally a horrid idea and out of the question.<br/><br/>So the question of "do we break a few eggs for the greater good" becomes more relevant in Dread. In a normal supers game, it's pretty much entirely out of the question, so it's not even a relevant question. It's like those console RPGs that "give" you "choices" like, "Do you say hello to this Major NPC, or do you set him on fire and eat his children?" It's simply stupid given the game, and out of the question.<br/>And it's not like the game is made up of a bunch of Chaotic Evil baddasses being as badass as possible, killing dudes in the way simply because they can, where the baddie controlling them is just icing on a murder cake.<br/><br/>It makes that choice relevant, for each character (and player) to answer in their own way, depending on the groups in question as well. <br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183653/#Comment_183653" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-16T09:06:29+00:00" title="December 16, 2008  9:06AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>It makes that choice relevant, for each character (and player) to answer in their own way, depending on the groups in question as well.</blockquote>It certainly does, but there's tricks that can dial down the "blast anything that moves" PC reaction, and we know them well from... DitV.<br/><br/>The demon's possessing that kindly old shop keeper who lets you run a LONG line of credit and is easy with day-old bread.

Possibly from one's own team mates, but DEFINITELY hitting America's Most Wanted, the MIB's Hunted List, and possibly being courted by Things Man Was Not Meant To Know (don't want to spoil the game's metaplot for anyone not having read the GM section).
