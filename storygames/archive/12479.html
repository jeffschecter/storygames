Nothing remotely like D&amp;D.  But I like to immerse in medieval fantasy!  I love playing some ignorant dude who doesn't know what's possible and what's out there in the big bad world, and oh shit, is that magic?!<br/><br/>I've played a lot that way, but since it derived from dungeon crawls, play always revolved around missions.  "Let's go to a new place and face whatever it throws at us to win rewards!"  Whether that's dungeons, pit traps and gold, or villages, cultists and spells -- we still wind up getting deeply into character POV in order to sneak and solve and fight on some quest to Beat the Dungeon or Save the Town.  It always seemed like the best thing for the group to do together.<br/><br/>So, I'm wondering what alternatives there might be.<br/><br/>If (a) you were playing a game in character POV, <br/>and (b) your character was part of a GROUP that stuck together, <br/>and (c) y'all were bent on pursuing secrets and power, <br/>what would you want to spend your time doing?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280172/#Comment_280172" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-12T14:43:25+00:00" title="July 12, 2010  2:43PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I kinda did this with my last Warhammer Fantasy 2e game. It was a huge group, but (most of) the players were really trying to build a place for their characters to grow. Nobody started off with magic, and were thrown into an akward situation as conscripts for the Marienburg city watch, but they all tried to make the best of it, and started to create routines, make contacts, and gain reputations.<br/>Little by little, they learned more about the way the city really worked, even though it wasn't necessary, and discovered secrets they "probably" shouldn't have known about. By the time we wrapped up (mainly because a group of 11 players was too unwiedly), they had managed to become a cornerstone of Marienburg's criminal powerstructure, as well as officially in charge of the Watch and the Militia, all while gaining only a little bit of magic, and some cursory mutations.<br/>All together, the players really stuck with the ground-level of the game, thinking in local terms and not considering the potential war about to begin (even though three of them were long time Warhammer mini players, and four were playing the MMORPG). They were eventually making their own adventures, as they explored areas of the city that piqued their interest, and followed up on information and rumors that sounded important.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280174/#Comment_280174" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-12T14:47:29+00:00" title="July 12, 2010  2:47PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It sounds like ascending to prominence within the city was the payoff, right?

They started with a simple gambling operation they wanted a piece of, and progressed to a larger gambling house, then curbing the slave trade while forcing many of the refugees from other lands into indentured servitude. As they learned more about the city and such, they knew which gangs to target, which officials to go to for information or "jobs," and so on. They publicly defeated known criminals and threats, much to the PR-minded pleasure of the city officials, and took a lot of the threat away from the commoners, but would replace it with better-organized deals, black markets, and "protection fees."<br/>It took quite a while, but combined with their "heroic" nature in comparison to regular NPCs, they eventually became a force to be reckoned with. They still couldn't do much outside of the city, where they had to continuously deal with incursions of Skaven and those damned Sigmarites, but inside the city, they were essentially a selfish-evil combination of SWAT/FBI/CIA.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280185/#Comment_280185" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-12T15:20:47+00:00" title="July 12, 2010  3:20PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This game sounds really fun!

So in this way (1) the players tell the GM what they want to do by picking which common knowledge thread to follow, and then by asking the NPC questions, and (2) the GM tells the players how to do what they want via the NPC.

In some cases, though, they just stumbled into things. Like that first gambling den was a complete accident. They were involved in a "small" barroom brawl, threw some drunk through a back door, and were pleasantly surprised to find a bunch of locals partaking in a high-stakes cardgame. Not "technically" illegal, by Marienburg standards, but they were able to drum up charges enough that it gave them a foothold.<br/>The Warhammer Fantasy system did make it pretty easy to gauge what information the characters would find out, and what they wouldn't. I treated it like their damage system, where the tens digit became the number of questions they could "hold" (much like Apocalypse World), and the target's Willpower roll determined how many "answers" it cost, minimum 1 for a failed check, plus whatever modifiers for how dead they would be if they divuldged the information.<br/>For example, as I remember it, they were interrogating a captured slaver, and got about 5 successes (thanks to a bonus from having a VERY threatening Tilean in the party). The slaver got only one success on his Willpower, and so the players were able to get some good information out of him. Of course, after three bits of info, they then asked about who his buyer was, and since this was a major bit of info (also because I hadn't figured out the answer for it yet), I added +3 to the cost, which they didn't have enough successes left for. It worked out pretty well.<br/>As for implementing their plans, they usually didn't need much guidance from me. They typically had enough ideas of how to do things, based on their own character concepts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280190/#Comment_280190" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-12T15:38:04+00:00" title="July 12, 2010  3:38PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...and it was actually a complete reversal from where I was originally intending the story to go.

I was never obligated to give them answers that helped them out; in fact, sometimes the truth was exactly what they DIDN'T want, which was one way I was able to curb their advancement if they were going too fast (when they found out one of the gangs was supported by the local Sigmarite Temple, they decided to tred much more carefully). But still, that if anything gave them a chance to try things out from different angles, exploring new options, and even making some really bad mistakes.<br/>Otherwise, if it was at all possible, I tried to give them answers that would help steer the plot in my direction, while coloring it with the game-word.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280427/#Comment_280427" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-13T14:10:39+00:00" title="July 13, 2010  2:10PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool.  Sounds like a pretty thorough collaboration.  Returning to the point of my original post, I'm wondering if this qualifies as mission-based play or not.  At some point the players have freedom and choices and opportunities, but then they pick an opportunity to pursue, and at <i>that</i> point, I imagine there's a group goal and that the GM's job is to give them both obstacles and ways to achieve it.  The fact that your specifics are more about urban intrigue than wilderness combat doesn't make it "not a mission".

They had certain tasks they needed to perform if they wanted to be an effective Watch (which they managed to do in very round-about ways), and they had certain motivations they followed of their own accord. There was only a little of "A must be accomplished for B to happen and receive C reward," which is more of how I view "missions."<br/><br/>As for obstacles and locales for their many, many side-treks, I actually had several dozen NPC cards and rough maps, which I could draw upon when the moment arose. I never said to myself "well, I need to have thugs A through G appear in location Z" unless it was one of my own scenarios. Everything else was based on the situation and environment the characters found themselves in. Luckily I was an old hand at improvised games, particularly Feng Shui, so this was much easier for me than some. Only rarely did I need to take some time during a break to customize an opponent or draw up a detailed plan for anything that the players were pursuing based on their own motivations. And when it came down to figuring out how certain goals could be accomplished, a lot of that was determined on the fly, based on what they were attempting, comparing it with what one could expect from that situation, balancing with what is happening in my own "scenario," and improvising from there.<br/><br/>Still, it all really depends on how one defines a "mission," I guess. I would say they were less of a mission, and more of an episode.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280452/#Comment_280452" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-13T15:23:51+00:00" title="July 13, 2010  3:23PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 13, 2010 3:25PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>If (a) you were playing a game in character POV,<br/>and (b) your character was part of a GROUP that stuck together,<br/>and (c) y'all were bent on pursuing secrets and power,<br/>what would you want to spend your time doing?</blockquote>\nI would want to have an enemy -- some group that we can work against, so that we always have at least one clear motivation with a built-in measure of success ("Did it hurt them more than it hurt us?").  We'd be pursuing secrets and power so that we could turn them against our enemy.  We'd see what they were trying to do and go stop them.  We'd find allies against them.  We'd sabotage or subvert their alliances.  We'd never be at a loss for what to do next; if no one in our group had anything that we wanted to go after on our own, we could turn our attentions to what our enemy is doing and make that the focus of our activity.<br/><br/>It's a very flexible setup with a lot of advantages.  The game would have an ending (which is always a big plus): either we beat our enemy or we're beaten by them.  We could run this game in a city, in a nation, or across the globe.

We've played some non-fantasy games with this structure; in one, the PCs were a crime family out to expand their empire...which they did mostly by targeting other criminal organizations, subverting the cops, and (most amusingly) eliminating NPC rivals within the organization.  As in, if you wanted to get a piece of the illegal wetware business, you'd do it by getting the guy who's currently running it out of the way.  There was a lot of collaboration going on to build up the initial situation and to fill in whatever gaps in the organizational structure we ran across along the way, but from that point forward it was all about what the characters wanted, who would need to be dealt with to get it, and what their reaction to that would be.  And goals stayed flexible: PC and NPC schemes and desires would collide with each other and spin off in new directions (in the wetware example, the PCs canceled their assassination plot and turned their attention to the wetware guy's wife...eventually blackmailing her to get leverage over the police captain she was having an affair with).  \n<blockquote>Huh.

So it's not just "this is a game about coming-of-age student hijinks, okay, go ahead and start," but instead we start with a genre and then agree to throw in something else on top of it; the students are all mech pilots in training and the war is nearly at the gates of the school, or the entire town is plagued by supernatural monsters and the rich kids are behind it, or this is senior year and everyone's going to move away after graduation and also this is our last chance to make our mark, or whatever.  It's not mission-based, because the PCs aren't being shuttled from one thing that must be done to the next thing that must be done, and what the PCs choose to focus on can evolve as the game goes on and the PCs interact with the setting and the NPCs.  Sometimes we flail around a bit anyway, but the genre and the situation gives us enough structure to keep things stumbling along until we find our groove.<br/><br/>So I guess what I should've said is that genre acts as kind of an entry point for me:  it gives me a way that I can think "oh, okay, these are the kinds of characters that fit here and the kinds of things they would care about" (which I have a hard time doing with fantasy settings).  Starting with genre and then adding in the situation makes the game actually work.  So yeah, you have to find a situation that works for you, something that gets the game moving in a direction where you get the kind of non-mission-based play you're looking for.  Quite possibly "easier said than done," I guess.  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281302/#Comment_281302" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-17T13:02:23+00:00" title="July 17, 2010  1:02PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Enemies, huh?<br/><br/>For Delve, my first impulse would be that they would be a group of some kind that is working to *keep secrets away from the people*.

Both games seem to share certain awesome qualities:<br/><br/>The PCs have a long-term goal that is neither too specific (kill one guy) nor too broad (become powerful).<br/><br/>The PCs' goal intersects with multiple factions that the GM understands well enough to play.

You might have the outcast freaks and geeks in a narrow-minded rural high school who decide they want to win the academic decathlon, be homecoming king/queen, and get those stupid creationist textbooks out of their science classes.  Or it could be Ferris Bueller's Day Off, only Ferris is a group of kids, and Cameron is basically everyone else who has had a crappy time in high school: the Ferris team goes through that senior year giving all of those Camerons the happiness and freedom they deserve, no matter what the principal, teachers, and PTA have to say about it.  (Which now that I've typed it sounds like THE MOST AWESOME GAME EVER, so I'm making a note of it on my to-play list.)<br/><br/>I think it's really hard to come up with a good situation in a vacuum without potentially wasting a lot of effort.  If you don't start with some information (what's the setting like?  what do the characters want?), you run the risk of developing lots of things that the players simply won't care about and which will never really catch on in play.  Starting with a genre helps in that can give you a few common set pieces, dumb jocks and puritanical PTA board presidents and hippie art teachers and so forth, but ideally you want to end up with NPCs who will have goals that are both identifiable and directed at (or very near to) the PCs, and getting there means sitting down and talking about who the PCs are and what their goals might be.<br/><br/>And that's actually what I think of when I think about what makes for a good situation:  characters who will want something and will have to deal with other characters before they can get it.  Maybe they're opposition, maybe they're allies, maybe there are compromises to be made, but at some point it's going to boil down to people interacting with each other, and that's what gets me excited about gaming.  I get more jazzed about that than I do PCs-vs-monsters or PCs-vs-puzzles, I suppose.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281397/#Comment_281397" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-18T01:44:01+00:00" title="July 18, 2010  1:44AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 18, 2010 10:39AM by David_Berg.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All the ideas in this thread thus far sound like situations of "survey/brainstorm options, form a goal, pursue that goal".  I guess goals are kind of mandatory if you're in a group that wants secrets and/or power.  Right?  I can't think of any fun alternatives...<br/><br/>So, when is pursuing a goal a "mission" and when isn't it?  I think the key for me in this thread is "what does the pursuit consist of?"<br/><br/>My archetypal mission includes recon, entry, sneaking, violence, and retrieval.  But something could just be recon and violence and still feel mission-like if... uh... if it took long enough and there were multiple obstacles?  Is that the key feature of missions, that they're multi-step?  And maybe Gremlin's Marienburg Watch game was different because I can imagine each goal (appease this faction, infiltrate that faction) being achieved in 20 minutes or over 10 sessions?  Maybe <i>diffusion</i> is a key to non-mission play?  That goals aren't pursued in a one-at-a-time until-they're-done sort of way?<br/><br/>It's not that I don't like missions!  I'm just trying to broaden my horizons here.  If someone wants to tell me that they'd know how to have fun with my (a)(b)(c) formulation by having their characters <i>sit in one spot and never move</i>*, I'd love to hear it!<br/><br/>*or anything equally atypical -- that was just an example                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281436/#Comment_281436" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-18T09:55:33+00:00" title="July 18, 2010  9:55AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave,<br/><br/>I agree with your comments on "diffusion"--it's more fun when goals/missions are all overlapping and inter-related in interesting ways. That's sort of the interesting part of having an enemy--there's always different things going on that you can interact with: whatever you're doing to gain an advantage, but also whatever THEY're doing that you need to react to or forestall.<br/><br/>I don't think "secret cult" and "easily found" are necessarily contradictory. After all, the characters (PCs) are special in some way, right, or they wouldn't be PCs? So, maybe what makes them special is that they can reliably find the supernatural (finding the "secret cult" indirectly) or the cult itself. Maybe that card deck was stolen from the "bad guys", and therefore keys into whatever they're doing, or something similar. Or something equally mysterious and sinister, so that as you play you can learn more about how and why it works.<br/><br/>(I'm always interested in the "understand foreign and bizarre metaphysics" when I hear about Delve, so that's where I'm coming from.)<br/><br/>As for goals, I don't know how it looks in long-term play, but for the one-shot setups we did (twice), the goals the characters were after seemed to large-scale, too vague to interact with play in a meaningful way. Like, OK, I crave power/wealth/influence. But I don't really have any good basis to choose that avenue of power over that one. WHY do I crave power (or whatever)? What kind of power is more appealing to me? What do I wish I could do that I can't do right now? If it's "protect my family" that's very different from "conquer distant lands". So I think your observation on finding the middle ground between too vague and far-reaching and too specific is right on!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281451/#Comment_281451" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-18T10:54:24+00:00" title="July 18, 2010 10:54AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 18, 2010 10:54AM by David_Berg.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I think "find them" goes further than just knowing where a given dude is likely to show up.  It's more about having enough information to form a plan that you can act on.  The PCs would not only need to find secret cult groups, they'd also need to know enough about each one to meaningfully pick which one to attack, which one to bribe, which one to join, etc.  Finding out such info in play is fun; it just needs to happen <i>prior</i> to going to those places and pursuing those goals.<br/><br/>Maybe if the PCs got their hands on a cult higher-up who would tell them all about the cult's organization and projects, but wouldn't tell them all the secret knowledge the cult has amassed...  Or an extremely detailed charter or flow chart that did the same...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281681/#Comment_281681" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-19T11:07:24+00:00" title="July 19, 2010 11:07AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That reminds me of the plot of several fantasy novels I've read!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281817/#Comment_281817" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-19T22:19:16+00:00" title="July 19, 2010 10:19PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh.
