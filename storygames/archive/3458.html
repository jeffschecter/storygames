Currently listening to: Hearts of Space: Mediterranean Echoes).<br/><br/>So I forget where it was, but recently there's been discussion here and there about "crappy single-concept thematic RPGs" (the RPG resolves around one concept and one concept only: MLWM, Breaking the Ice, etc), and how there's just this endless fucking flood of them hemorrhaging out of communities like this one and The Forge, Game Chef, etc*.<br/><br/>When playable, they're fun. No doubt.<br/><br/>I'm far more a traditional gamer kind of guy, though. I like My Guy, and Being the GM, and all that jazz. I love to throw some Story Games Sauce** all over the place when I run or play them, as setting up situation, focusing on relationships and emotional mechanics, and even a little lack of total character control really light me up.<br/><br/>However, I think I came to the realization that while I like these games I see around me, I'm really biding my time for the Better Games that will come out of this dearth, that proudly ride on the backs of their predecessors and peers. The 300-page Star Trek-like game that will use Best Friends style character generation. The martial arts game that will play out like a game-y board game, yet whose stories consistently leave the players teary-eyed at the table. The 5-page-long Dungeons and Dragons (ish game) that uses simply playing cards, has a setting of mythical India, and can be busted out and completed in hour-long sessions.<br/><br/>While I pretty much keep my fingers on the pulse (or alternately "mouth on the pipe") of what's coming out in both mainstream and indie (regardless of affiliation: I'm talking JAGS, Starcluster, and Key20 titles as much as Forge or IPR titles), I've been coming to terms recently, especially seeing all the crazy buzz here, on LJ, and on Gamecraft (like the stuff that is applicable to Your Game Right Now and doesn't require its own system), with the fact that when I see all sorts of new games coming out, I'm really looking for those few diamonds that stand on the backs of <i>those</i> games.<br/><br/>Seeing that process taking place right before my eyes has been really magical.<br/><br/>That's all.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>* Game Chef left me absolutely drained and devastated this year, seriously. Out of all the games I read and reviewed, like 90% of them I wanted to play right then and there. I was actually afraid to read other games for fear that I would want to play them to, and that was really kinda twisting me up in knots, even moreso than the last three years.<br/><br/>** Not to be confused with the kind of sauce that appears frequently in Takeshi Miike movies.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77943/#Comment_77943" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-26T17:02:17+00:00" title="June 26, 2007  5:02PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm. Interesting. I've been kind of thinking about this since getting back from GO PLAY NW. It seems to me that I maybe favor the opposite. I like a game that is focused, concise and about one thing. I think that one thing can be enough to provide a lot of interesting play and (asuming the game is good) make me want to come back to the game over and over again. I may be misreading you, but it seems to me that what you're saying is that you want something that fits in with a more traditional game theme that you might enjoy (Star Trek, Martial Arts, D&amp;D), but uses the same awesomeness that you love from Breaking the Ice, Roach or whatever. I can completely get this. When Panty Explosion came out there were a lot of people who said "I would really like this if it where Samurai or Naruto or Star Wars". When you see awesomeness, you want it to be awesomeness in something you like, right? Isn't that why we all love Spirit of the Century? It's awesome like Dogs in the Vinyard, Shooting the Moon or Contenders, but it uses a "safe" genre. We all like high flying pulp action. We can all get behind that. It pushes a button that this community really likes having pushed, in a way that some other games don't.<br/><br/>Here's the thing though. The more I play these games though, the more I feel like a more directed and focused "one idea" game is what I want. In the same way that when a buy a novel I'm looking for something very specific and not something very general, or when I go see a movie I want the particular experience that movie creates. I like playing Contenders because Contenders does something very, very specific that I really, really enjoy. I enjoy Contenders enough that I really, really want to keep playing it. It doesn't matter that Contenders "only does boxing". What matters is that it's the right game for me. I don't need to play Contenders as a side game to my normal game or as a one shot. Contenders is the game for me.<br/><br/>So the thing I was wondering about in general was, do we want these "diamonds that stand on the backs of those games" because we want better games, or because we want games that do these awesome things but cater more to our personal tastes? If it is the later... well, there's nothing wrong with  that. We want what we want. But what I'm finding is that more and more what I personally want isn't Star Trek, Martial Arts or D&amp;D. Or maybe it is. What I reall am interested in is a personal vision. Because if I want to play Star Trek, or Martial Arts or whatever, I can. I don't need someones rulebook for that. I don't need 30 pages of feats, or a life path or some fan mail. But I would have never thought to play BlissStage. BlissStage is a very personal vision. It would have never occured to me to play something like that. Once I saw it I wanted to try it. I didn't want to go home and try to make Fate or D20 work for it. I wanted to buy into Ben's vision completely, in the same way that I wanted to experience Zodiac in the theatre earlier this year instead of just browsing the internet looking for old news articles. I bought (or borrowed or played) Perfect, Dogs in the Vinyard, Sign in Stranger, It was A Mutual Descision, Burning Empires, Death's Door, PTA and a number of other games for the exact same reason. In each case it was the designers personal vision that attracted me to the game. In each case I didn't know I wanted to play it until I saw it.<br/><br/>I know I'm flying away from the topic at a dramatic speed, so let me try to circle back around. What I suspect is that becasue we prefer fantasy (or pulp, or sci-fi or whatever genre is safe for us individually), we're going to be unsatisfied (to some degree) with games like Breaking the Ice, Contenders or Roach. They don't give us what we want. On the other hand, If what we want is a game about romance, relationships, sex or close friendships, we're going to be... well, Burning Wheel, Spirit of the Century or any other number of games arn't going to work for us, but we'll be very happy with some of the other games I've mentioned here. I think a lot of the games that we've seen released over the last few years from this community (and i'll throw my own games in here) are not actually intended FOR this community. Rather, these games are created for a different audience, with the hope that this coummunity might enjoy them as well.<br/><br/>I know I'm going on and on, so let me get to my real point. I've recently realized that I don't actually like fantasy games. I mean I do, but it's not my favorite thing. But because I'm interested in roleplaying games I've been "forced" to play fantasy games for years. I also have realized that I prefer a narrow focus game to  a game that allows me to do "anything I want". If what I want is to go on a series of three dates, then I don't need a game that allows me to also shoot people or plot master crimes. Breaking the Ice is the perfect game for what I want. <br/><br/>So really, after all that, all I'm saying is that I've kind of been thinking about the same thing, and what I've decided is that I do like a narrow focused game, and that I prefer to play something that isn't fantasy. Which doesn't really addres what you were talking about to much at all, does it Andy?<br/><br/>Oh well.<br/><br/><br/>jake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77950/#Comment_77950" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-26T17:44:46+00:00" title="June 26, 2007  5:44PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jake richmond</cite><br/>So really, after all that, all I'm saying is that I've kind of been thinking about the same thing, and what I've decided is that I do like a narrow focused game, and that I prefer to play something that isn't fantasy.

Taking my disgust of recently hearing the phrase "all these crappy Forge-style minigames", and circling around as to why I myself love them, like buying them, like playing them, like seeing how they spark ideas in other people, then following those peoples projects as they expand upon those same elements or introduce those elements into a new framework.<br/><br/>Hmm. I reread what I wrote, then read your response, and I think I was misfiring a little, or more accurately didn't well express what I was thinking.  I made some examples (Star Trek, Kung Fu, Fantasy), but I meant "generic cool-sounding example theme games that expand or evolve upon the games that came before it".<br/><br/>My ramble above was probably another way of saying:<br/><br/>"I love watching and taking part in this community of creative peers, to see how it develops, and reap the rewards of the great things it produces, particularly those works that were produced from a refinement of an earlier concept."<br/><br/>Make sense?<br/><br/>Reading my reread of the above, though, I think my post was about as controversial and thought provoking as:<br/><br/>"WHO LIKES CANDY!!!

I can play very specialized premises for a handful of games in order to explore them.  I increasingly prefer distributed story authority, though I still enjoy having a GM or arbiter.  But what really charms me are toolbox games that let me build lots of very different stories, not narrow-theme games.  This is why I'm more interested in <i>Spirit of the Century</i>, <i>Wushu</i> or <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>, warts and all, than in <i>Breaking the Ice</i>, <i>Best Friends</i> or <i>Bacchanale</i>.<br/><br/>Some games are designed with a relatively narrow focus but turn out to be eminently portable; <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> comes to mind, though it's not as narrow as my previous examples anyway.  Other times I expect a game to allow a much vaster scope and I find it's in fact very focused, like <i>Burning Empires</i>; I feel disappointed.  <br/><br/>This is not that different from the feeling I get from traditional RPGs that have very detailed settings with lots of canon material; the more fenced-in by the system or setting I feel, the less interested I am.  I like to have lots of margin to scribble in.  A game that is solely about breaking up, or about boxing, or about dying, or what have you, feels like a board game to me.  And although some days I like playing board games, ultimately I find them unsatisfying.  The games I keep returning to have lots of possible story modes and structures.<br/><br/>(Yay, candy!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zach%20Welhouse" title="Zach Welhouse"><img alt="Zach Welhouse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zach%20Welhouse">Zach Welhouse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77969/#Comment_77969" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-26T19:24:33+00:00" title="June 26, 2007  7:24PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A game about candy, you say?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77976/#Comment_77976" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-26T20:50:37+00:00" title="June 26, 2007  8:50PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Y'know what I like?<br/><br/>I like that I can love playing My Life with Master, Dogs in the Vineyard and play some rockin' Burning Wheel for a while, start a promising campaign of Reign and then put the Star Wars Saga d20 RPG on my wishlist on Amazon and get ready to purchase it later this week once I get some shit done that I told myself I'd get done before I purchased my next batch of Amazon.com books.<br/><br/>The line between indie rpg's and mainstream rpg's is an online illustion; its smoke and bullshit.<br/><br/>THAT is what I like.<br/><br/>Thanks for the positive vibes, Andy.<br/><br/>*group hug*<br/><br/>*hands in the center*<br/><br/>Ready!<br/><br/>Go play!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77984/#Comment_77984" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-26T23:08:20+00:00" title="June 26, 2007 11:08PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The line between indie rpg's and mainstream rpg's is an online illustion; its smoke and bullshit.<br/><br/>THAT is what I like.</blockquote>\nneat.\n<blockquote>But what really charms me are toolbox games that let me build lots of very different stories, not narrow-theme games.

But the neat thing is that we have the choice.

I think I was trying to force some stuff I've been thinking about into the conversation, and I ended up ignoring what you were saying. I think my main contention with what you were saying (if you want to call it a contention at all) is that I think a lot of the more narrowly focused games arn't really as narrow as many people assume. Both Breaking the Ice and Shooting the moon are pretty damn broad, especially if what you want is a game about romance or relationships. If what you want is a game about spaceship battles, these games might seem narrow or restrictive. And it goes both ways. Burning Empires is really restrictive if I want a game about the emotional struggles of boxers. Contenders is really restrictive if I want space opera. You can do space opera with Contenders (you can), but the narrow focus of the game doesn't encourage it. I think because most of us (and I know I shouldn't really speak for anyone but myself, but still...) come from a fantasy/sci-fi gaming background and want that kind of stuff in our games. I think that's part of it anyway. I think we're also used to games that SEEM to have a broader focus, so when something like Perfect comes along it might feel a little constrained. But I think that's just a matter of perspective in many cases. It's not constrained or narrowly focused if what you want to use it for is playing Perfect. If you wnat to use it for Star Wars, it's going to feel way to narrow.<br/><br/>Hmm. Look at me telling you stuff you already know.

Good.  Here's what I mean: There was a time in my life when I have the financial and chronal resources to pick up the next book from White Wolf or WotC or whomever every week or so.  They were typically started at $20+ and I rarely got out of my FLGS for less than $30-40.  And then I would read them - cover to cover.  And a good chunk of the time I could find someone to talk to about them.  Maybe I would incorporate them into one of the several games I was involved with at the time.<br/><br/>Flash forward to today.  Sure I make more money than then, but I have a wife and family.  So what I want now is nuggets intense coolness.  That's what indie games, by and large, represent to me.  I can pick up a game for $20 or less.  I can thumb through it in less than an hour and then absorb the coolness at my leisure.  I'm probably never going to run anything with the game, but since my time and dollar investment is lower, it bothers me less. <br/><br/>I'm still getting my gaming fix - just in a more managable package.

I'm not saying one is necessarily better than the other, but I think there is a significant difference between the two.<br/>I enjoy both kinds, and my sentiments are with Robert.  Indie story games are different on average from traditional tabletop RPGs.  However, that may not be a substantial disagreement.  By saying that the <i>line</i> is an illusion can be read to emphasize the overlap and category-breaking.  There are a lot of games that are well away from the center of either category.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78122/#Comment_78122" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-27T11:52:28+00:00" title="June 27, 2007 11:52AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I buy them because they're fun to play.<br/><br/>But to each their own.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben<br/><br/>P.S.

But! Ever heard of the Burgess Shale? It's a particular rock formation that has a staggering variety of fossils in it -- more fundamentally different ways of arranging the body (phyla) than exist in all subsequent evolution. (I'm cribbing shamelessly from Stephen J. Gould's <i>Wonderful Life</i> here; I'm no paleontologist). The key thing about the Burgess Shale is that it preserves fossils from the "Cambrian Explosion," a very early period AFTER the basic principles of organizing a multi-cellular life form were evolved but BEFORE there had been a mass extinction to weed out the designs.<br/><br/>Now, combined with the fact that two years is a fast cycle time -- D&amp;D splits off from miniatures gaming say, circa 1974-1975? That's only 30 years ago -- one generation! ANd much of that time was spent, as it had to be, thrashing out "uh, what is this new thing anyway?" and running basic variations on the original wargaming structures, rather like Precambrian evolution throwing out lots of slightly different ways to be a single-celled organism.<br/><br/>I don't know the hobby history too well, but the earliest conflict resolution/fortune in the middle design I know of is <i>Story Engine</i> from, what, the mid-nineties? (There are probably earlier examples). By analogy, roleplaying game design is hitting its "Burgess Shale" period: We've got the basics, we've just opened up to some radically different ways of playing with them, so now it's time to try a zillion crazy combinations. Most of which won't work, true. But it's worth exploring the entire space of what's possible.<br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78222/#Comment_78222" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-27T14:38:59+00:00" title="June 27, 2007  2:38PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm here because ya'll are are a collective of awesome.</blockquote>\nQFT.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78251/#Comment_78251" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-27T16:59:23+00:00" title="June 27, 2007  4:59PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Yes, screwing around with new mechanics purely for the sake of being innovative is Not So Great.

(I'm cribbing shamelessly from Stephen J. Gould's Wonderful Life here; I'm no paleontologist). The key thing about the Burgess Shale is that it preserves fossils from the "Cambrian Explosion," a very early period AFTER the basic principles of organizing a multi-cellular life form were evolved but BEFORE there had been a mass extinction to weed out the designs.<br/><br/>Now, combined with the fact that two years is a fast cycle time -- D&amp;D splits off from miniatures gaming say, circa 1974-1975? That's only 30 years ago -- one generation! ANd much of that time was spent, as it had to be, thrashing out "uh, what is this new thing anyway?" and running basic variations on the original wargaming structures, rather like Precambrian evolution throwing out lots of slightly different ways to be a single-celled organism.<br/><br/>I don't know the hobby history too well, but the earliest conflict resolution/fortune in the middle design I know of is Story Engine from, what, the mid-nineties? (There are probably earlier examples). By analogy, roleplaying game design is hitting its "Burgess Shale" period: We've got the basics, we've just opened up to some radically different ways of playing with them, so now it's time to try a zillion crazy combinations. Most of which won't work, true. But it's worth exploring the entire space of what's possible.</blockquote>\nNeat analogy. I can totally buy that. I'm looking forward to the point when our games evolve enough to hold jobs, breed and create games of their own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78395/#Comment_78395" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-28T09:33:48+00:00" title="June 28, 2007  9:33AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Other times I expect a game to allow a much vaster scope and I find it's in fact very focused, like Burning Empires; I feel disappointed.</blockquote>\nSophie, I just reread this and I have to ask, what exactly were you expecting?

The secondary one is that, if I'm going to do that, there are other systems that are a far better fit.

I do know that for the most part "narrow focus" games are more appealing to me then tool box games. They grab my interest more. I'd much rather play Bliss Stage then a generic mech game. Why? Bliss Stage is interesting (to me). It has a setting and themes that I think are neat, and rules that support these. Generic mech game has neither, and seems really boring (to me). \n<blockquote>I can try narrow-focus game in order to explore a particular aspect, but I'm not likely to replay them much.</blockquote>\nWhy do you not feel these games have replay value (or at least as much replay value as the tool box games)? Is it just because they don't personally appeal to you, or because there is something that you feel is flawed about the games themselves? \n<blockquote>My go-to games are all construction sets in terms of mechanics or setting or even both. </blockquote>\nIt occurs to me that most games are construction sets, at least to a limited extent. Burning Empires is a construction set for playing games set in the (as you pointed out) Sheva's War storyline/setting/whatever. It is narrow, but if that's the game you came to play then the construction set tools are certainly there. <br/><br/>I've been wondering more and more if the  tendency of gamers to prefer a construction kit is due to a kind of natural desire to tinker with, modify, improve or otherwise change games to fit their desires. A kind of answer to the bit inside of us that wants to make games? Or, is it maybe because we just haven't found the game we want? Have customization and tool box games arisen from the fact that for the last 30 years most game settings have sucked?  That most games have done a poor job of emmulating the fiction of Tolkien, Howard and other genre authors? That most games have done a poor job of giving us rules that allow us to play the games we really want to play? So we have to fix these games to make them what we want them to be? If we had a game that did what we wanted it to do, would we still feel like we needed a toolbox?<br/><br/>I'm sure some of us would. There's a ton of appeal to the tool box, and certainly  many people like many games just for that reason. But it seems like you can have a narrow focus game that still provides a lot of tool box goodness. I'm finding more and more games that give me the play experience that I want without leaving me feeling like I need to modify them to get there. Using my own game as an example, Panty Explosion has the narrow focus of psychic Japanese school girls and social relationships between teenagers, but still contains plenty of tool box elements. Sign in Stranger is (I think) pretty tool boxy, but still carries with it a narrow focus that I find appealing and a lot of unique flavor that I wouldn't get in Traveller, D20 Future or some other more "generic" sci-fi games. I'm saying I don't think that narrow focus and tool box are mutually exclusive. It seems to me a game can be both. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Jake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
