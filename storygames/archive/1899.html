                    This is a very interesting article that Rob posted in the NOVEMBER Links thread, and I figured it might be worth its own thread.<br/><br/>Here's the link:<br/><br/><a href="http://lostgarden.com/2006/07/ze-story-snobs.html" rel="nofollow">http://lostgarden.com/2006/07/ze-story-snobs.html</a><br/><br/>Here's the pullquote:<br/><br/><i>There exists a powerful group within the gaming world that actively seeks to stamp out innovation unless it falls along the prescribed lines of their rigid and conservative doctrine. Who are these people? They are every developer, gamer and publisher who promotes the ideal that a good game must have a story.</i><br/><br/>I totally agree with the article, but then again the article is focused completely on electronic/console gaming. It is ironic that they brandy about the word "RPG" when talking about console games (sorry, folks, we lost that word). But it is a solid thesis.<br/><br/>My question: Anyone finding anything applicable to role-playing games?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>

                            Not so much. The sense in which he's talking "story" is much more akin to "meta-plot" in TTRPG than the sense of Story Now or whatever.<br/><br/>Although certainly the That's Not An RPG response to various departures from the tried-and-true DnD model is reflected, I think that particular form of geek herding is universal.                        </div>

                            Don't we have to choose a meaning for the word "story" before we can really answer that question? What is it and how is it created?  <br/>
<br/>
In computer games, the relationship of user to designer allows a direct delivery of a scripted series of events that we can call a story. Some role-playing styles aspire to this as well, but few succeed. Others are interested in merely putting up challenges for the players to meet and to hell with overall continuation. And then there's people like me, who want to my play to generate a story that has some meaning for me.<br/>
<br/>
I think that both traditional and small press rpg designers come from both camps. I don't think the market or the business is big enough for eather to have the power to prescribe in the same way such a movement might with the huge electronic game industry.<br/>
<br/>
Those are the interesting aspects I can see right now.<br/>

Yes, in the sense that what the article espouses seems, to me, to be pretty much what the Ron and the Forge have been recommending for years now. I.e., advising against unhealthy illusionism, force, fudging, Abashed Narrativism, "railroading," etc.<br/><br/>Unless I'm just reading it wrong.                        </div>

                            The author also seems to strongly correlate story with the sort of cutscene driven stories that make the player a passive observer of what's going on.  I find it a very small step from Cutscenes to any other dictatorial vision of what the story "should be" about, such as, say, a railroading GM.  Now, in those terms, this is no great insight - games the GM tries to force to follow a script tend to suck - but it's an important enough one that it's interesting to see coming at it from another direction.<br/><br/>Now, that's the generous interpretation.  Drilling in a bit more we come to that really fantastic fuzzy area where we end up wondering where boardgames end and RPGs begin, and what _really_ constitutes the difference, and in turn leads to the question of what an RPG actually is.  And in that area this is one more interesting perspective (replace "story" with "roleplaying" and assume that this is coming from a wargamer rather than a programmer, and the nuances work surprisingly well) on that.<br/><br/>And heck.  If nothing else, it makes me realize that console RPGs might be better called Console Story Games, for if nothing else, they _do_ tell a story. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            Firstly, this is mostly all I see when I read that article: whinewhinewhinewhinewhine.  If the games this guy likes aren't being published, he's got three productive options: (a) stop buying the other games, (b) get off his ass and build a better game, and (c) scratch his itch some other way, like German board gaming.  This article does none of this or proposes any of it.  It boils down to "the entire industry that has perfectly good reasons for doing what it's already doing should change everything to suit my preferences" which is total and absolute bullshit.<br/><br/>Secondly, the guy totally overlooks one of the big reasons that story (properly narrative) is so huge in video games and every other media on the face of the planet: crossovers, licensing, and brand recognition.  If a game has a story, it can have a sequel.  It can have a prequel.  It can have the characters on lunchboxes, backpacks, jackets, and wallets.  You can make completely different games with those characters in it for no real reason, and have it sell (MarioKart, Dead or Alive <em>Volleyball</em>).  You can spin off a movie.  And all of those produce more revenue.  There is no Tetris: the Movie.  Nobody has Tetris blocks on their jackets.  There are Tetris sequels, sure, but why do I need another incarnation of Tetris when I have the original?  I get that the guy is concerned with his in-the-moment play experiences, but spouting off about the industry without considering, well, <em>the industry</em> is kind of stupid.<br/><br/>His analysis of "story = reward" is really superficial.  Stories in video games also provide context, motivation, ambiguity, color, and a ton of other valuable stuff.  To say that story only ever makes you happy or excited for a few seconds is really underestimating the powerful uses that story can be put to.<br/><br/>Overall, it seems to me that he's not criticising stories in games, he's criticizing <em>poorly implemented stories</em> in games.  I think it's telling that he offers no examples of games that would have done better without stories, and the examples he cites of good games include Grand Theft Auto, which does indeed have a story involved, complete with cutscenes.                        </div>

                            Well, this is <i>sometimes</i> true in video games. It seems to me he's mostly going on about how many games with mediocre gameplay have tightly-scripted highly-featured story presentation. Stories which, mind you, are also pretty mediocre. All of which seems to be a roundabout way of saying "Stop putting style over substance!" Which is a problem which has plagued video games for at least a decade now; here "storyline" stands in for the usual whipping boy of "kewl graphics."<br/><br/>I'm totally unconcerned with applicability to role-playing games since RPGs are commercially a drop in the bucket compared to electronic games and don't face the same level of marketdroid pressure. The proper analogue to the sort of games he's complaining about in RPG terms are most published "campaign" adventures, such as nearly every published AD&amp;D adventure from mid-1980s to 2000, and most Call of Cthulhu campaigns. I don't think those are nearly as vogue in this hobby as they once were, and they are easily recognized as not the same thing as our present "story games."                        </div>

                            Word, Joshua.<br/><br/>This guy is just loudly bitching about a type of game he doesn't like. But good for him. Loud bitching is fine. I don't think it's "applicable" to anything I'm doing or enjoying, though. Sometimes heavy story and cutscenes are awesome, and sometimes they're not. Depends on the game and the mood I'm in. I like all the flavors. Setting up camp and stringing barbed-wire around some furious little passion is just not my cup of tea.                        </div>

                            My day job is in the electronic games world, so I agree with a lot of what he says although he is pretty bitchy about it.  but I don't agree that Tetris could get made now.  It's just harder to get games like that published.  But if the game rocks than no one cares about the story or lack thereof.  We play Guitar Hero at work everyday and no one wonders "where the story is".  <br/><br/>I don't see the danger to paper-and-pencil games either.  I feel like the indie community is very focused on game mechanics so I don't see much danger of the lameness in hardcore video games happening here anytime soon.<br/><br/>Cool site thought.

                            I agree there's not a whole lot applicable in the article per se.

Isn't that really just a side effect of moving away from the dungeon/geographic based adventure, though? I mean, it seems like you could push that urge back to the 1970s.                        </div>

                            Lost Garden is coming from a very different world than we are. Obviously the crowd on a forum called "Story Games" are going to be hugely pro story. I see his point as being that electronic game development is currently being driven by a lot of forces that aren't necessarily about making the best game possible. Also, I beleive he is a game developer so telling him to "build a better game" isn't necessarily apropos. That's probably what he's trying to do.                        </div>

                            I think that there's a "story" output intended for most RPGs to some extent, and I'd agree with John that it's pretty prevalent these days. Not all games have it as the entirity of the goal of play, but almost all have it as a goal at least in some small measure.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, there's D&amp;D. Which, when played in one of it's most common incarnations - hack n' slash for a lack of a better name - has near zero output that could be sanely called story. Which is, in fact, the alternative form from the original article above, really. So, while I'd say that in terms of design, John is right, story is king these days, that in terms of play, story has a lot of healthy competition.<br/>
<br/>
If John is saying that there should be more designs that focus on the "non-story" goals of play, I couldn't agree more. There are a few, however, like Rune.<br/>

<p>I'm with Jared. It's interesting to create that in turn create stories with a framework, but I feel most RPGs are just fine creating intriguing fictional events which we later weave into a story. Most RPGs have taken this approach. What I want to see are new RPGs that generate more fictional detail in simpler, more elegant fashion. We've had a lot of innovation in other areas, playing with director stance, creating mechanics that encourage specific behaviors, focusing more on conflict instead of tasks. But detail creation is still pretty much stuck with '70s RPG technology, consulting look-up tables. And, in that sense, demanding story <em>has</em> stamped out innovation, since some people seem to fear that fictional details that aren't under player control will spoil the "story", instead of being an opportunity to make a story more interesting.</p>

<blockquote>If John is saying that there should be more designs that focus on the "non-story" goals of play, I couldn't agree more. There are a few, however, like Rune.</blockquote>
Yes, Rune is a counter-example.  It's not an anti-story game, trying desperately not to make anything which could be called a story. Rather, it focuses on goals other than story goals.  (In the same way that Monopoly or Talisman are not story games, even though they do produce a linear sequence of events which could be told as a story.)  A partial example of less story-focused games would be world-focused games, like Tekumel or HarnMaster.  Those are quite rare in the past 15 years, though.  <br/><br/>I'd agree that story has been the trend since moving away from location-exploration.  However, it's not like location-exploration or story are the only two possibilities.  For example, <a href="http://www.interactingarts.org/index.php?id=24,52,0,0,1,0" rel="nofollow"><b>Mellan Himmel och hav</b></a> was a role-playing game which focused on gender roles without having a focus on story.                        </div>

(If you don't see the difference between the former and the latter, you've got some catching up to do.) I could criticize the former as an example of story games and how they're ruining role-playing, but it would be a strawman, because that would be misrepresenting our mutually understood definition.                        </div>
