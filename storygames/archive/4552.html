It is a random chance event that is an unlikely outcome of attempting an action, which generally does not have long-term consequences.  Typically, encounters are scaled in such a way that success is difficult, but doable.  If you fail, it's a temporary derailment from the march of progress.  The gm must provide the illusion of danger without killing off all the pcs; after all, what's the fun of that?  I'd say that this is generally the case for traditional rpgs like D20, Storyteller, Gurps, etc.<br/><br/>2. It is a real possibility that is planned for in the mechanics, with specific mechanical side effects.  This is much more rare; for example, in Polaris, if you fail to succeed at a die roll to resolve a conflict, you gain certain mechanical side effects which progress the character or refresh certain resources.  Again, this a randomly selected outcome, chiefly influenced by the roll of the dice.<br/><br/>Does anyone know of a system where people can choose whether to succeed or fail in advance, with each of these options being a viable alternative?  I'd love to find a game where I could go into a session and say, "This session, I am going to fail miserably.  I will lose things and sacrifice."  By choosing to lose, I would gain the resources I need to enable later victory, but at a terrific cost.<br/><br/>I'm looking for a specific "feel" to this system and how the narration would work that I can't quite describe, so I'd like to hear as many options as possible.  Anyone heard of something like this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SabreCat" title="SabreCat"><img alt="SabreCat" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://cheri.shyou.org/~sabrecat/images/msuttner-storygames_tani.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SabreCat">SabreCat</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103019/#Comment_103019" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-14T14:48:40+00:00" title="October 14, 2007  2:48PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Spirit of the Century</i> and its underlying <i>FATE</i> allow the player to take an automatic failure as the result of a Compel, and thus add to their pool of Fate points to better leverage their powers later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stevebarkeruk" title="stevebarkeruk"><img alt="stevebarkeruk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.collective-endeavour.com/files/pictures/picture-239.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stevebarkeruk">stevebarkeruk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103020/#Comment_103020" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-14T14:51:15+00:00" title="October 14, 2007  2:51PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>With Great Power...</i> does something like that, encouraging the 'suffering' of aspects (these being anything that defines the hero, such as superpowers, friends, beliefs) to increase the power of card play in later scenes.<br/><br/>Resolution is by simultaneously playing of card from the players' hands, so you can deliberately play low cards to try and lose the conflict and cause suffering to your aspect, increasing the drama as well as the power of your cards for later conflicts                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103023/#Comment_103023" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-14T15:32:14+00:00" title="October 14, 2007  3:32PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know that the standard d20/WoD/GURPS rules assume that a total-party-kill isn't fun.

Even knowing that going in to a conflict, it produces some pretty awesome results. Like, when the players hit the fourth of five milestones, they knew that they had to throw two more challenges before they could eventually take down the enemy.<br/><br/>And even though the players were thinking, "ok, cool, we just need to throw the next two conflicts. Fail miserably. Lose things and sacrifice myself", there was still some open ground to NOT doing that: Specifically, we had two conflicts where the players just wanted to win them, even though losing would have advanced the plot. If I'm recalling correctly, one of the players had a Mary Jane style love interest, and it became clear that she was on the line (lose, and she gets caputred... with the implication that eventually you will track her down or whatever), and the player said, "No, fuck you, I'm going for the WIN!" and did.<br/><br/>But, when squinting at the system, it sets you up for systematic, juicy, glorious failure. Hard, rough failure in order to have that much of a more spectacular final success.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103052/#Comment_103052" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-14T20:11:31+00:00" title="October 14, 2007  8:11PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I play Dogs with the intent of losing conflicts all the time.

You decide when to fail, you cannot fail at failing, and failing can create some interesting situations, but if you don't step to the tower at least once by the end of them game, you're not going to have much impact on the story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103247/#Comment_103247" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-16T09:59:27+00:00" title="October 16, 2007  9:59AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In <i>Shock:</i>, the only way to build up more dice for future conflicts is to lose one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103627/#Comment_103627" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T08:05:36+00:00" title="October 18, 2007  8:05AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a little puzzled by your reference to Polaris in this context. In Polaris, if you, say, as the heart want the protagonist to fail, you can just start narrating it "I swing at the demon, but clumsily miss" "I smile at the pretty lady, but I look like a moron" In turn, the mistaken might try to compromise your attempt to make the protagonist fail so much. "But only if you accidently stab another demon that was trying to sneak up on you." "But only if the pretty lady finds your awkwardness endearing"  If you want the character to fail, then make him fail.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
