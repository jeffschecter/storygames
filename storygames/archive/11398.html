Of course, have the ability to buyoff and purchase new Keys.

But I, too, dislike the WoD XP system. So just last night, I wrote down a system we'll use that mixes some points from <em>Primetime Adventures</em> and D&amp;D 4E.<br/><br/>You generally don't have a hard time with "chronicle" meaning "campaign," or "chapter" meaning "session," but WoD's got this third term, "story," for a short number of chapters (maybe 1, maybe 10) with a single major plotline. I formalized this a bit: our chronicle might have as many stories as the group wants to play, but each story will last for six chapters. At the start of each story, you assign a 3, two 2's, and three 1's to those six chapters. The chapter you assign a 3 to centers on your character. In a 2, you play a secondary character. In a 1, you play a supporting role. At the end of the chapter, you get that much XP.<br/><br/>Kinda skimpy, though, right? Well, in addition, we've got a pile of index cards. Anybody can add an index card to the pile. Each one has a mission on it, like, "Steal the fetish." You can label it with the name of a PC, or with "Pack." When they fulfill that mission, you get 1 XP. If it has a PC's name, that PC gets 1 XP. If it says "Pack," everyone gets 1 XP.<br/><br/>So, in your spotlight chapter, if you accomplish two missions, you'll have 5 XP.

The hardest thing to make happen has been what feels to me like immersion. Having the players try to get in the heads of their characters, and make the characters act on their motivations. Like the character who is "fearful" and then ignores dangers or jumps into fights. Or the player who says their character is curious and investigative, then sits back and just listens the whole time and doesn't make the character _do_ anything.<br/><br/>Mostly I want to have the players be able to say "my character is like _this_" and get rewarded ingame by their own actions.<br/><br/>So - "I'm protective of my kid sister" doesn't seem to normally get any mechanical bonus in a RP game, except for maybe a "good rp" bonus XP point. or "I dont believe this mystic crap" and have the characters actions to disprove, irgnore mystic crap have a mechanical impact <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>A number of us in my current group have tried to play like this, and have interesting characters driven by their history/beliefs, but find that when they act "sub-optimally" according to the rules, it starts to suck and we fall behind the curve.<br/><br/>For the longest time (2 years?) we were playing nWoD, and Exalted. In the last 6 months we've tried PrimeTime Adventures, Mouseguard, Houses of the Blooded, In a Wicked Age...: The problem with those is that there isn't enough crunch to really play with, and the non-traditional (sharing GM roles, huge narrative authority etc) gamestyles really made the enjoyment of the character get left behind.<br/><br/>Hence why the heading back to a known rule system (Storytelling system) but trying to tweak it to give solid rewards (xp) for playing to their character motivations, or to a theme<br/><br/>So character could start with a couple of keys, and then have a story key (Key of Heroism) that applies to everyone perhaps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254070/#Comment_254070" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T10:56:59+00:00" title="January 31, 2010 10:56AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 31, 2010 11:04AM by FigureFour.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like well chosen Keys are exactly what you want, although I'm unsure about the "story key". It sounds slightly counter to your stated intent.<br/><br/>Keys will reward the characters for doing what they said their character will do ("playing in character") in a concrete way, but the story Key will reward them for being heroic even if they are playing a cowardly (or otherwise unheroic) character.<br/><br/>If you think that rewarding heroism is equally (or more) important to rewarding "playing in character" then your plan looks good to me.<br/><br/>Edit: Oh yeah. You might want to keep an eye on how quickly your players are advancing. My own experience and intuition tells me that a clever and driven player will probably be able to hit a key quicker than the Storyteller system would usually hand out XP. Personally I wouldn't worry, since I think Storyteller is a little stingy as written, but you might want to keep it in mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254084/#Comment_254084" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T12:07:06+00:00" title="January 31, 2010 12:07PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The key of heroism was just an example.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we did a horror game, maybe a key of victim might be needed, like - get xp for wandering into a dark room, got more for loosing useful tools, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut yes, the story key was just something to help acting 'in theme' more often.

Players have a story goal that becomes fairly clear early on into the session or arc, and once they complete it they get a sizeable reward. What they do in between is up to them. It's a fairly traditional method of handing out XP, but it's not the explicit Y XP for killing Z monster system.<br/><br/>I guess what that does is changes XP from a task resolution system (1XP for good roleplaying) to conflict resolution (10XP for completing the story). I think it works quite seamlessly with almost any system that makes use of XP.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
