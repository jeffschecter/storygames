Couldn't have understood the subtle distinction without it. I find the topic interesting and the approach refreshingly rigorous - keep up the good work.<br/><br/>My thinking on this topic is that it's another one of those totalizing discourses that were endemic before we got postmodernism and learned (at the Forge, that is) to look at games as specific, independent practices different from each other. I'd have to answer the question by saying that in most games I play the presumption is that we play in character without immersing in character, at least intentionally. Many games are relatively agnostic and don't actively prevent immersion, but the play culture and many of the systematic processes encourage an ironic distance: you the player should often be able to look at what your character is doing and enjoy the comedy (not embarrassment), tragedy (not despair), judgment (not evil impulses) and so on - many games don't really work correctly if the player is unable or unwilling to have this split viewpoint, in fact, as merely experiencing the emotions is not the same dramatic payoff an audience gets, and many games assume that the players get this payoff to orient further play.<br/><br/>But if the game is such that the thing is to immerse, then I'm certainly going to do my best - why play otherwise. I do emphasize, however, that either immersing or not immersing in character is not my attribute here, but an attribute of the game I'm playing; my attribute is just that I play different games now and then. In both of those cases almost every game I play is such that either OOC information is not used, it is not present or it is equivalent to IC information - utilizing OOC information by breaking character to do it is almost unknown as other than a theoretical phenomenon, as I don't usually play games where anybody would have a reason for doing this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335461/#Comment_335461" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-21T02:04:40+00:00" title="July 21, 2011  2:04AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 21, 2011 2:07AM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe I'm just being a pedant but it seems logically impossible to be able to play 'totally in character' without imagining being your character, when you define 'totally in character' as limiting yourself to the motives and knowledge of your character. There is no way to determine what the in-character motives and knowledge of your character <i>are</i> except by imagining being them. How else would you possibly figure out what their motives are, or what knowledge they possess, except by imagining that you are them, and determining from that perspective what they know or desire?<br/><br/>So, uh, yeah. I also don't understand how you could imagine something about the game and have that NOT make the game seem more vivid and real. Once again that just seems definitionally the case, regardless of what other sort of thoughts you are having about the game; if you make some additional effort to think about the in-fiction reality of the game, the game's fiction is going to seem more real to you... because you just thought about it more. Unless, I guess, the fiction is really incoherent?<br/><br/>But I mean, this works in real life too, generally speaking; people you spend more time paying attention to also generally seem more real than (say) the people in a distant country.<br/><br/>Anyways, pedantry mode off -- Eero said some far more interesting and relevant things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_335462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335462/#Comment_335462" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-21T02:33:08+00:00" title="July 21, 2011  2:33AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: omnifray (in the thread on rpg.net)</cite>... what is the feature of in-character immersive roleplay which makes hardcore immersionists (such as myself) so fixated with immersive roleplay, and to what degree do different sorts of ways of playing (whether they are strictly in-character immersion or not) give you that same essential feature or not.</blockquote>The real feature of "in-character immersive roleplay" is that your experiences in such a mode gets <i>validity</i> through the way this play-mode engage you; you are brought into human conditions in a far more intuitive way by this play-mode than in any other.

In those sorts of games, I do not even attempt to immerse. I may not even bother to use my own character's name, let alone anyone else's. <br/><br/>Likewise, I'm not 100% sure what you mean by "totalising discourse". Do you mean that the poll tends to assume/imply that a given individual has one mode only of approaching gaming in general, which is "totalising" in the sense that it obfuscates the truth that in many cases a given gamer will approach Game A (played with Group X) in a very different way to Game B (played with Group X) or Game C (played with Group Y)? If so, I would plead guilty, but mitigating circumstances:- the Big Purple has very restrictive parameters for the polls you can set up for straight voting. I was right up against the word limits for the six options I chose, and I could have added a few more options, but not hundreds more. To justify the usefulness of the poll despite this limitation, I would argue that many gamers have limited opportunities or strong, relatively narrow preferences for gaming and in either such case such gamers generally tend to game with the same bunch of people in a similar way; such gamers will only have a narrow set of gaming experiences to report, which can be adequately captured by a poll which starts "when/if/though/because...", and if your gaming experience cannot be captured in that way, you can vote "other". The "when/if/though/because" is an important starting point for the poll, although you must be right that a single gamer might not have a single answer even to a question which starts that way, but in some cases various answers depending on the circumstances.<br/><br/>In short please explain more about "totalising discourse" and "postmodernism" and whether I have understood your points correctly!<br/><br/>I would also note that whilst YOUR attribute may be that you behave in a broad range of different ways in different games, SOME gamers may not be capable of behaving in some of those ways. SOME people seem utterly incapable of achieving in-character immersion in any situation they have yet experienced (or, at least, incapable of recognising what they are experiencing as in-character immersion). Other people, such as myself, may find it very difficult to engage in a psychologically committed fashion with a roleplaying game / storygame WITHOUT willy-nilly experiencing some level of immersion in character regardless of any specific intention to do so. For instance I experienced immersion playing Montsegur 1244, albeit that it was an interrupted and broken-up experience of immersion. I suspect from the way you write that you are possibly an unusually open-minded or unusually analytical gamer who is willing to engage with many different ways of gaming, whereas many, many gamers are a little set in their ways and have more basic tendencies which are easier to pin down with a simple poll than yours might be. On the other hand you also achieve relatively greater clarity of introspective thought than many gamers and can report your own experiences of gaming in a more insightful way. But I speculate...<br/><br/>As a general point, I feel that human beings have interesting general psychological tendencies which have some variation from individual to individual and which we can meaningfully explore to some limited extent with polls even if a poll asks how the person tends to behave, and does not have sufficient options to account for all permutations of gaming which a given individual voter might have experienced. We may have to be very careful with the results but they at least give us a starting point and a leg up into the debate. I think it is eminently possible to generalise without totalising, as it were - to draw meaningful conclusions of application beyond a specific instance, whilst recognising that they are not universally true even of any specific gamer whose experiences are part of the basis for those conclusions.<br/><br/>As to your notion of a "split viewpoint", I wonder whether it is related to the notion of "dual consciousness" as explored in Bella Merlin's book Beyond Stanislavsky: the Psycho-Physical Approach to Actor Training. The nub of that concept seems to me to be the idea that the mind may operate at several levels at once:- in part immersed in character; in part exercising technical supervision; in part holistically uniting the two. On the other hand though, Merlin cautions against being self-critical during performance as that can take you out of character. I hasten to add that she does not ever use the word "immersion" in anything I have read; I am translating her ideas into RPG terms and possibly misconstruing them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335586/#Comment_335586" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-21T20:11:29+00:00" title="July 21, 2011  8:11PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hate playing in character, and in my experience that sort of mentality leads to some really horribly games.

One of my own personal benchmarks for the worth of rpg discussion in the Internet has for years been quite simple: is this discussion about a specific game and its procedural model, or does the old-fashioned notion of a singular roleplaying practice underlie it? The latter is a huge problem in my eyes, as unless you're actually discussing the universal nature of roleplaying openly, any such presumption about roleplaying being a singular practice will end up a covert discussion of the same: people who play different games will all describe their own way to roleplay, and these differences are then taken as root causes of disagreement instead of simply acknowledging that there are many different roleplaying games in the world, and they are played differently from each other. I characterize this common blind spot in rpg discourse as a "modernist" fallacy because of how very well it maps on similar universalist attempts in other fields through the 20th century, all of which nowadays go under that label to contrast with pluralist "post-modern" thinking that attempts to understand phenomena with appropriate concern for their individual differences.<br/><br/>This difference in the quality of understanding cannot be underestimated, I think; the only reason for the universalist presumption to continue to be popular is that many roleplayers do not realize how narrow their own experience of the form is and how few of their common practices are truly dictated by the form, and how many are simply necessary elements of the specific game they play in their specific social circumstances. This thing puts an indelible mark on how people tend to think about roleplaying - for one thing, an universalist mode of thought requires universalist game design, the efficacy of which has been discussed in length elsewhere.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: omnifray</cite>As a general point, I feel that human beings have interesting general psychological tendencies which have some variation from individual to individual and which we can meaningfully explore to some limited extent with polls even if a poll asks how the person tends to behave, and does not have sufficient options to account for all permutations of gaming which a given individual voter might have experienced. We may have to be very careful with the results but they at least give us a starting point and a leg up into the debate. I think it is eminently possible to generalise without totalising, as it were - to draw meaningful conclusions of application beyond a specific instance, whilst recognising that they are not universally true even of any specific gamer whose experiences are part of the basis for those conclusions.</blockquote>\nThis is a good justification for discussing things like whether an individual person immerses or not. I would still argue myself that surely any singular tendencies on the part of individuals is first to be explained by the gaming conditions and only second by individual psychological tendencies. Your set-up at RPG.net makes it seem like the quality of how people immerse is an individual difference, when I would, indeed, like to argue that the most important individual quality here is the issue of which games people usually play, and with which people. You're querying people about elements of the play experience that are adequately explained without relying on their individual preferences; indeed, one might ask whether self-description can be considered reliable when the describing self might not ever have had an opportunity to truly experience more than one kind of play. Is your poll, then, not more a question of "which kinds of games do you usually play" than a poll of individual experience? A person who's never played a game that facilitates immersion well (a member of a hardcore D&amp;D group, say) will have a very lop-sided experience base here, and in many ways his answer will reflect that.<br/><br/>Despite my criticism I think that this approach has some merit; I find it credible that individuals do truly have preferences in this regard, and for some they may even be informed preferences. It's interesting to find out about how people perceive this sort of thing. I just don't agree with the theoretical framework that tries to dissect individual experience without accounting for the game system and agenda of play first. I couldn't off-hand construct a better poll, though, this being such a complex topic; I guess my poll would simply replace every "do you play this way" with "does your current favourite game do this", or something of the sort.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_335613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335613/#Comment_335613" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-22T02:14:35+00:00" title="July 22, 2011  2:14AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>That's pretty much it.

By observing the differences you may come to realize how wonderfully bad you may play them, and how gruesomely beautiful you may play the very same games. The quality of your gameplay will suffer while you are blind to these things, whatever game you play.<br/><br/>And then; while discovering how little there is that differ one game from the other, you may come to see how important these differences really are; how they spell one game a disaster, and another game a tool for your salvation, even if you as a player is enlightened. You may come to see that some games are life-changing tools of great enjoyment, while other games will produce rubbish however you use them. When you do, there is no need to cater for the idea that all games are equal anymore. Play the gold, and leave the rubbish.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335622/#Comment_335622" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-22T04:07:46+00:00" title="July 22, 2011  4:07AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 22, 2011 4:12AM by omnifray.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>... One of my own personal benchmarks ... played differently from each other. </blockquote>\nI think rather than taking "a specific game and its procedural model" as the focus for a discussion of this kind, there may be value in taking "roleplaying games / storygames when you are playing them in a certain way". You could play BECMI D&amp;D, for instance, in many different ways.<br/><br/>How do you form categories of playstyle which are worth asking about separately? Well, I think you have to analyse introspectively and from self-reported feedback what people enjoy about particular playstyles, and then if two at first seemingly distinct playstyles actually trace their enjoyment factor back to largely the same fundamental human response, then group them together and ask questions about them. For instance, many styles of storygaming might be explicable on the basis that the participants enjoy exercising their actively imaginative creativity; many forms of gaming might alternatively be explicable on the basis that the participants particularly enjoy the vividness and immediacy of the experience.<br/><br/>However isolating these playstyles for a general poll of the Big Purplies is difficult,<br/><br/>As for the poll I set up, if you miss out some of the permutations you can read it as asking "WHEN you don't imagine being your character, BUT restrict yourself to in-character knowledge and motives, does it tend to make the character seem more vivid to you?". With that WHEN and BUT we have already narrowed the playstyles down to a fairly focused subset of playstyles. The next step I suppose in the analysis is to look at the types of approach to gaming that those people take for whom this in-character thinking (in the absence of imagining being the character)  DOES lead to greater vividness, and the types of approach to gaming that those people take for whom it DOESN'T lead to greater vividness. We can then see whether they cluster - do those who DO get greater vividness in play tend to play similar styles of game to each other, and do those who DON'T get greater vividness in play tend to play similar styles of games to each other, but different to the first lot? It would also be interesting to work out whether the gamers have other personality traits which cluster in this way, but that is a more difficult analysis.<br/><br/>But for my purposes what I really wanted to discover was WHETHER IN ANY COMMON WAY of approaching roleplaying games / storygames there were significant ways in which in-character thinking could enhance vividness for ANY significant group of players without those players imagining being the character. TBH I am a little surprised at the fact that there seems to be a significant affirmative response to that question. The fact that there are ANY significant number of gamers who report that as their common experience means that in the right circumstances totally in-character thinking can enhance vividness for some gamers (at least) even though they don't imagine being their characters. That finding in itself is useful:- it means that it MAY be worth considering so-called "Actor Stance" alongside true in-character immersion (such as for instance what some might call immersion in "Character Stance") as a style of gaming which, like true immersive roleplay, potentially has as one of its primary aims, functions and/or effects the enhancement of the vividness of the game-experience. I am not so bothered about whether "Actor Stance immersion" of this kind fits my definition of true immersive roleplay; it interests me more that it has some functionality in common with it, which is relevant to any consideration of how best to cater for true immersive roleplay because people who don't imagine being their characters may yet get a similar enhanced vividness of play through what outwardly seems to be essentially the same style of gaming, so may be able to join in seamlessly with games designed for true immersive play. It may be that given the potential tension between factors in "me feeling as if I am the character" and factors in "the character seeming to be real", the "Actor Stance" guy may prioritise believabilty over such things as free flow of play or reliance on player skill or direct speech, all of which may be critical to true in-character immersion. But I suspect that the differences are relatively small in practice and not difficult to accommodate.<br/><br/>The answers people have given so far are to the effect that for about a third of those voting who do NOT imagine being their character but DO stick to in-character knowledge and motives, that makes play more vivid for them. Whether they know this from playing their favourite games, or from occasionally playing characters who (unusually for them) they cannot imagine being, or from occasionally playing immersive-style games despite preferring a more narrativistic storygaming approach - is irrelevant. Therefore I am not interested only in their favourite game, but rather in their general impression of their experience of those games where they do not imagine being their characters but do stick to in-character knowledge and motives. I would expect that as those games have a lot in common already, most people who have played that way would have a unified impression as to whether sticking to in-character knowledge and motives generally helps to make the character seem more vivid to them or not, even if they have played a broad range of different games with that same fundamental unifying feature. In fact, I wouldn't bet that there is ANY gamer out there who has played a variety of games in which they do NOT imagine being their character and DO play totally in-character but who feels that in some specific sorts of THOSE games this makes the character seem more vivid and in other specific sorts of THOSE games it doesn't - unless you are going to take fringe and unsatisfactory cases like "games where I play characters so unlike me that I just can't imagine being them no matter how hard I try, but i still do my best to immerse and it still makes it more vivid" or "games which are played on a social/casual basis without any expectation of really getting into the game-fiction so even though I am doing things which would otherwise make the game-fiction seem more vivid to me, it doesn't, simply because the game-fiction utterly lacks vividness from the outset".\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>I characterize this common blind spot in rpg ... individual differences.</blockquote>\nIf you are unconvinced by a generalising analysis of something as relatively homogenous as roleplaying gaming and storygaming playstyles and experiences, how can you stomach a generalising analysis of "modernist" or indeed "post-modernist" thinking? It may be that the potential for fallacious thinking is far greater when you try to group styles of philosophical thought together than when you try to group gaming playstyles together. Labelling something as "modernist" or "post-modernist" may conceal more than it reveals. More broadly, what experience I have of the formal study of one small area of philosophy consistently suggested to me that most philosophy is, at its root, baseless, or serves only to reveal the baselessness of various forms of thinking. A lot of it struggles to defend itself against perceptions of being pure semantics, precisely because (contrary to the views of its proponents) it ultimately does boil down to semantics. What I can draw from what you have said about modernism / postmodernism is that there is a tension between on the one hand the desire to systematise, derive patterns and thus render more comprehensible the phenomena of our universe and on the other hand the desire to avoid crass oversimplification, the obfuscation of issues due to failure to distinguish between different phenomena in relevant ways.There is an old saying - the failure to see the wood for the trees.<br/>Postmodernism may lead to precisely that sort of intellectual bankruptcy. The two competing desires - finding patterns, and avoiding misleading oversimplification - must be held in balance. I don't think that one of these competing desires can be given general primacy over the other. They have to be held in balance. If you think that one of them currently needs a boost compared to the other, that reflects your subjective perception that they are currently out of balance in the field of human thought in general. But think of this:- without grammar, there would be no language. Without the patterns of mathematics, we could not even play snooker or pool, far less send rockets to the Moon. Jung may suggest that some people prioritise intuitive thinking (pattern-finding) and others prioritise "sensing" (absorption of raw data), but the fact is that both tendencies exist because both are necessary. It's no better having data without links than having links without data.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>This difference in the quality of understanding ... in length elsewhere.</blockquote>\nI don't know whether that's absolutely correct or not. Certainly I know some gamers who seem to have a narrow experience of gaming and narrow ideas as to what gaming <i>should</i> be. But even those gamers are aware that some people game in other ways; they simply can't empathise with the enjoyment those other people get from their other games, and when they talk about how gaming should be, it is implicit that they mean "in order for a person such as myself to enjoy it; and other types of people may enjoy other things, but that's of limited or no interest to me". Moreover, I think there is real value in identifying the fundamental source of the buzz that a particular person most enjoys getting from roleplaying, because there is little point in concentrating on a playstyle which doesn't fundamentally appeal to anyone (at least unless it is a compromise playstyle for social reasons). One you identify those fundamental different kinds of buzz, you can group them together, and arrive at broad categories such as "vividness of the game-fiction" or "actively imaginative creativity". You can then sensibly generalise from different people's experience within vastly different games of enjoyment of the same fundamental buzz, and sensibly ask what does or does not help to promote that kind of buzz. Of course the answer MAY vary to some extent, or even radically, from situation to situation, or from gamer to gamer, but the trick is to look for clusters and use them at least as a smorgasbord of suggestions which have been found to work for large numbers of gamers in situation X and may therefore work for you if you are interested in that kind of game-buzz.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335625/#Comment_335625" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-22T04:19:27+00:00" title="July 22, 2011  4:19AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: thadrine</cite>I hate playing in character, and in my experience that sort of mentality leads to some really horribly games. ...</blockquote>\nPlease give examples of your experience!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335832/#Comment_335832" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-24T00:28:26+00:00" title="July 24, 2011 12:28AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sometimes, generally briefly.
