Any questions or comments that may help detailing the picture of Nordic larps are welcome.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><cite>Posted By: Tomas HVM</cite>This sounds exactly like the grand live-roleplaying games which have been organized here in Scandinavia for the last 20 years.</blockquote>\nTomas, how does it work?  How is it organized and administered and adjudicated?Oh bugger! I've stepped into the quagmire of explanatory endlessness again! But: it's my holiday and I have the time to make an effort ... ;-)<br/><br/>Late eighties the live-action RPGs started up as fantasy in the woods. It was made up with simple conflict-resolution systems and GMs wandering throughout the live, being judges and scene-framers. Often the GMs was pretty heavy-handed in steering the drama, and that met with a lot of critique.<br/><br/>So the larp evolved into a more intuitive and truly interactive form, shedding the heavy-handed GM and mechanics-focus inherited from tabletop RPGs in the process. By the mid ninethies the framework was laid in seminars before the actual game took place (often using as much as half a year in player-preparations before the game). The players were typically given a lot more freedom/responsibility for the actual drama (the real drama growing from their actions and interactions). Still fantasy was the predominant genre.<br/><br/>Development in the other Nordic countries were a bit different, but still there were grounds for sharing of experiences. The Nordic workshop/convention of <a href="http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knutepunkt" rel="nofollow"><b>Knutepunkt</b></a> (link to wikipedia-article) was started in 1997. It is an yearly event that has done much for knitting together the various larp-wrights and player-groups in the Nordic countries. In 2009 Norway is the host of Knutepunkt.<br/><br/>In the new millennium the genres is blossoming in Nordic larp. The games are increasingly experimental, exploring this form of RPGs to the full, with destiny-dramas, one-person larps, political art-larps, sexually laden dream-larps, etc-etc-etc. Classical RPG-genres as fantasy and sci-fi are explored too, and made better still (in this format). The whole form is opening up and blossiming like never before.<br/><br/>The cross-pollination of larps and tabletop RPGs is very fruitful too. A lot of new games, especially in the tabletop-form, make any division between the two very fuzzy. I am working in the tabletop-form, but have recently made games that may as well be described as mini-larps. And I do not mind you calling it whatever you like, actually. The interactive form of RPGs is finally beginning to paint the full picture, in my view. It is exciting to be part of this movement!<br/><br/>OK, enough history.<br/><br/><b>Some common traits of Nordic larp:</b><br/>- the larp may be planned for an evening, a weekend, a week or as an ongoing larp, almost any timeframe has been used again and again<br/>- it is typically an idealistic group-venture, being organized for the sake of the larp-idea itself, not for money<br/>- the drama is driven by player-interaction based on relations and conflicts, not by mechanics/rules<br/>- player groups and conflicts are carefully created before the game start<br/>- workshops are held for players to make costumes and/or other special elements for the larp (including dance lessons, impro-lessons, etc.), and to socialize<br/>- simple rules are made to ensure safety in play (example: to say "cut" or show scissor-fingers means the player have had enough; gameplay must stop for minute)<br/>- characters are given as descriptions of personality, placement in a social hierarchy and relations to family/friends/enemies. There are few or no stats involved<br/>- when gameplay commence the GMs typically stay in the background, helping out if players are lost, need a break or get caught in conflicts they can't resolve<br/>- the use of instructed players may vary, but it is a much used tool for GMs to manipulate the drama<br/><br/>There is a lot more to be said, and a lot more knowledgeable people than me to give you the details. However: I believe any sincere interest in the wonders of modern Nordic larp/RPGs would be best served by participating in the <i>Knutepunkt </i>gathering. There you may taste some practical examples of Nordic gameplay, talk with the in-people, and probably get some insights that will baffle you. It may very well change your views on RPGs as a whole.<br/><br/>The <a href="http://knutepunkt.laiv.org/" rel="nofollow"><b>Knutepunkt</b></a> may best be described as a maelstrom of ideas.<br/>(link to official web-site)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_157102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157102/#Comment_157102" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-17T04:54:58+00:00" title="July 17, 2008  4:54AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks.

I suppose magic work similarly: be reasonable with your spell invocation and suggestion of effects, and be a good player and let your eyeballs melt, if that fire blast is aimed at you.<br/><br/>We call it "freeform." Until I got to middle school, it was called "let's pretend." Even to this day, the SCA uses a similar system (albeit with hit locations and 'taking a knee" or "dropping a wielded item" for limb hits; down for head and torso hits).<br/><br/>So, yeah... it's improv (Yes, And...). Cool beans... but it will take a while for the from-table-top, high-sim US audience to accept such player empowerment (or, really, trust). I tried to make GLASS super light--only 30 verbals/verbs/Calls!--although it's creation mechanic's flexibility makes it very "rules heavy" on the front-end (and during Exp spending). maybe it's a reward system thing: the US LARP scene is too trained to "act, get goodie, use goodie to act better" cycle and can't play for the mere reward of being clever, in character, and experiencing dramatic situations?<br/><br/>Dunno... but I am getting more and more serious about doing a Jeepform or Nordic-style game at MACE, so I really need to know the techniques and tricks to get goal-driven, loot- and status-grubbing, average-gamer players to let go and just BE.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_157222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157222/#Comment_157222" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-17T13:43:14+00:00" title="July 17, 2008  1:43PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tomas, I've been trying to read up on Nordic LARPs and RPGs and it seems like I am seeing some crossover.  <br/><br/>Is that crossover really there?

We've (Finns) been traditonally big on creating the characters, character groups, initial conflicts and (sometimes) situtations beforehand, and pretty much distribute all the information through the character backgrounds, and then sticking with that information, and building the character entirely on it. The Swedes, I think, are much lighter on the preparation and leave much more for developement during the game, and are also big on utilizing the player workshops. Not sure on the other nordic countries (though we seem to have ample supply of players to fill in the gaps here), or how much the different approaches have been adapted in other countries.<br/><br/>I'd also think that the consequences are quite universally negotiated between the players and formalized systems are rarely used, with the notable exceptions like fateplay. Pre-planned conflicts that are ignored are, well, ignored. That used to be somewhat big issue back in the days, when larpwrights used more pre-planned scenes and tried to steer the play towards them during the game itself - or at least the techniques have become subtler. But like Thomas said, the GM's/larpwrights tend to stay in the background - if players choose to ignore something, that's entirely in their power.<br/><br/>As for information flow - there's rarely any flow that's active outside the context of characters. If someone is killed in the game, the chances are that you don't know, unless someone tells you, or you witness the act somehow. The games are prepared with this taken into account.<br/><br/>Along with the similarities and differences of the actual planning and execution of larp's in Nordic and other countries, it'd be intresting to compare the playing cultures and how universal they are. I'd argue that the playing cultures in Nordic areas (countries or part of countries) are strikingly similar, and that players have very similar ideas of how to play - and that differences begin to show when, for example, players from different countries play together. There's bound to be some culture clash when, for example, a troupe-style Swede and immersing-in-the-closet -kind of Finn try to play together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_157340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157340/#Comment_157340" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-18T08:55:56+00:00" title="July 18, 2008  8:55AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite><br/>Dunno... but I am getting more and more serious about doing a Jeepform or Nordic-style game at MACE, so I really need to know the techniques and tricks to get goal-driven, loot- and status-grubbing, average-gamer players to let go and just BE.</blockquote>\nThat's really patronizing.

How does information get disseminated? If conflicts are pre-planned, what happens when they are ignored, obviated, or go completely off the rails?</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Emily Care</cite>This sounds like the heart of it. How is this done? Through the character/setting materials? Through workshopping and prepatory exercises? Through player initiative? And as Jason asks, how are the consequences negotiated?</blockquote>\nJason and Emily and others: Jukka Koskelin has answered some of this, so I'll cite his answers and comment.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Merten</cite> I'd also think that the consequences are quite universally negotiated between the players and formalized systems are rarely used, with the notable exceptions like fateplay.</blockquote>Not quite in agreement with you here, Jukka. Simple systems <i>are </i>used in a lot of larps, although there are larps with settings that makes conflict-resolution systems redundant: like a game on corporate power struggle, a family dinner, an art-exibition, etc. The point is to make the players emphasize the <i>process </i>of conflict rather than resolving it, and to make the result come about as a consequence of inter-relations rather than inter-actions (intrigue/discussion/voting rather than combat).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Merten</cite>  Pre-planned conflicts that are ignored are, well, ignored. That used to be somewhat big issue back in the days, when larpwrights used more pre-planned scenes and tried to steer the play towards them during the game itself - or at least the techniques have become subtler.</blockquote>Exactly! Conflicts are "planned" as in putting the interest of various player groups up against eachothers. If the players don't focus on those interests however, the conflict is moot. The reason usually is that they got other things to do.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Merten</cite> As for information flow - there's rarely any flow that's active outside the context of characters. If someone is killed in the game, the chances are that you don't know, unless someone tells you, or you witness the act somehow. The games are prepared with this taken into account. </blockquote>Exactly!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Merten</cite> There's bound to be some culture clash when, for example, a troupe-style Swede and immersing-in-the-closet -kind of Finn try to play together.</blockquote>I believe there have been some culture-clashes yes, when inter-nordic larps has been arranged. Eirik mention some of it in his essay on the theme (see link above). As in RPGs the larp-scene also divides (partly) into classic and modern games.<br/><br/>The play styles that have been developed in the Nordic countries have really been <i>developed</i>. That is: the greater emphasis on conflict-processes, inter-relations and character immersion has been made possible by design-tools that have been developed by game-smiths in these countries through trying and failing over many years. Both the classical and modern games has been instrumental in this development, although the modern games have gone further in applying the experiences and pressing the boundaries even further. As I see it today, much of this development has been parallell for RPGs and larps. Modern Nordic RPGs (at least in Norway) are as subtle and effective in this respect as their larp-counterparts.<br/><br/>And this way of doing it is seeping into classical RPGs too. Most RPG-designers in the Nordic countries busy themselves with any and all games in the field, and have the benefit of most experiences communicated on the net. The synergies at work in the Nordic RPG-communities have grown, and are really something for itself these days. Perhaps it has to do with the relatively small communities we have, and the Nordic way of thinking (really we are all social-democrats, a term that implies a high degree of pragmatism in political and daily life).<br/><br/>OK, that's all from me this time! Hope you have seen some sense in these ramblings.
