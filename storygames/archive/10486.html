I had been making great progress on it until BRS reared its spiked metal head and demanded I write it instead or it woud hack me to pieces with a soul forged axe.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I realized when I went back to it, is that many of the central design goals for the game just aren't relevant any more.  Its no longer 2002 and the things I wanted the game to do in 2002...are pretty moot at this point.  Which is fine actually, because the things I wanted the game to do in 2002 are things that I found extremely fun to do...in 1998...and which I largely don't have much desire to do anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what I've done, is closed out all my old R&amp;R; files and started a new one.  Redesigning the game from the ground up to be the game I want to play today, rather than the game I wanted to play...&lt;mumble&gt;7 years ago&lt;mumble&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI started from scratch with an outline and the idea that if I couldn't remember how something worked in the older versions, it must not have been very central to play and thus was wide open to being redesigned.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm now designing the game in three parts.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart one is all of the "how do I do stuff in the game part" including all the fun swashbuckling with robots and building connections with other robots and the like, and that part is completely ready for testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart two is the "how does the Interlude work where the players, through their characters are trying to effect the world and either preserve it, transform it, or destroy it".  That part is conceptually complete and about 1/2 actually written.  The joy for me here is that this is really the heart of the game, but previously had been the most tedious and painfully unfun part to play.  Now I think I've found a solution that is much more interactive and interesting to do as a thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart three is the "how is the character defined, how does it grow, and transform, and interact with its programming".  Conceptually this is the part that is least changed from older versions but practically the part that is most changed.  I haven't started writing this part yet, but it will require me to make decisions about what stuff do I actually want / need to have on the character sheet (now that my old design goal of making it look like a traditional RPG in form is gone).  This will then impact how characters get created, how NPC get created, and how the transformation of the character from programmed robot to free thinking person gets reflected on the character sheet.  Alot of it is partially filled in by what I need to have to make the first two parts work.  But alot of it could go in a lot of different ways and the challenge will be making it fluid and snappy without losing all of the fun differentiation between individual robots I liked from previous versions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21" title="Ken Sentowski!"><img alt="Ken Sentowski!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21">Ken Sentowski!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233014/#Comment_233014" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-18T10:38:39+00:00" title="September 18, 2009 10:38AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You fucking love me and you know it...<br><br>So if you are designing the game in three parts, what are you going to do to get those three parts to fit seamlessly together?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233032/#Comment_233032" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-18T11:23:07+00:00" title="September 18, 2009 11:23AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2009 11:23AM by Valamir.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By designing them in that order.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the mistakes I made with R&amp;R; the first time is I decided what I wanted on my character sheet first.  I started with "how to build a robot" as the very first thing I wrote (after the intoductory premise summarizing the world).  I had 6 standard attributes that were given roboty names like "Locomotion" and "Processor".  I had a whole passel of "Programs" (aka skills) that would be loaded into "Memory" etc. etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich meant many of my actual play rules were informed and dictated by what I had on the character sheet.  For instance there was an entire set of rules for armor driven in part because I needed something to do with the robot's "Durability Stat" that made it work the same as the rest of the stats.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I'm doing this time is writing the rules first.  Like I know that there will be a pool of dice.  But I get to decide how I want that dice pool to work, how I want to read the roll, what things other than success/failure do I want the roll to tell me.  Then I get to reverse engineer what the stats are from there.  For instance, I know you roll the pool against a Target Number, and I know that Target Number will come from the character sheet because I want it to be something different from robot to robot.  And I know that I want it tie somehow into different types of conflict having different target numbers so robots will have different spheres they are effective vs. not effective in.  But I don't ACTUALLY know what stats are driving that yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I decide to have armor in the game it will be because its a fun thing to do and its use will flow naturally right with the mechanics and not be some obnoxious forced thing just because I have a stat I need to use so it doesn't become a "dump stat".<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPart 2, the interlude, is largely its own stand alone thing.  After a session playing your robot character swinging from chandeliers and buckling swashes you play a session (or part of one) discovering what's going on in the world of Auvernais with all of its many factions and growing crises threatening to destroy everything.  Its necessary for there to be a feed back loop from character effectiveness to the interlude back to character effectiveness but it isn't necessary to be "seamless" because, by design, there is a seam.  i.e. "now we will break from the regular game to play through the interlude"<br/>\n<br/>\nHere I'm keeping the mechanics very similar, such that the fight for gaining influence over the King feels much like a duel from regular play feels, but it is its own thing, a good bit more structured and defined than the more open roleplaying segments.  In old versions of the interlude there were too many choices of what players could do, which created enormous amounts of analysis paralysis and since each thing only had incremental impact it was very difficult to see the long term reason for choosing one over the other.  Also each action had its own substantial "mini game" which was my attempt to "simulate" the actual steps of what it would take to successfully locate and protect (say) an alternate power source.  Keeping all the rules straight for each mini-game proved less fun in practice then it was on paper.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this version what I wanted was a way of keeping the player's choices more limited and focused, but still allow for a wide range of possibilities (I didn't want what the players do about Auvernais to be overly programmed by limiting their options).  So I hit upon cards.  Putting the rules for each possible option on a card forced me to keep them succinct and to the point.  And controlling which cards a player does and doesn't have in their hand at any given time helps limit the choices the player has to make at any given time while still leaving the entire universe of options available.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis process also informs me of all of the things I need to have available or not available on the character sheet.  For instance, in earler versions you would record NPCs that you obtained and developed connections with in play on your character sheet.  Your actions would earn you favor with that NPC which you could later cash in for favors and in this way build up a network of contacts.  In my new design, since I went with cards, and since asking an NPC for a favor is one of the things you can do in the Interlude it became clear that your contacts shouldn't be recorded on your character sheet, they should be recorded on cards along with all of the other cards you have access to.  Unlike other actions where the cards limit the amount of space, for the NPCs this will increase the amount of space available, making it possible to really record more about interesting side kicks and the like that you acquire in your network.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that way when I get to part three, I will know all of the bare minimum stuff I need to have on the character sheet because I already will have written all of the "code" (so to speak) that calls on stuff from the character sheet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233048/#Comment_233048" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-18T12:10:45+00:00" title="September 18, 2009 12:10PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>I had been making great progress on it until BRS reared its spiked metal head and demanded I write it instead or it woud hack me to pieces with a soul forged axe.</blockquote>\nThat axe was forged out of my soul, by the way, Senkowski.
