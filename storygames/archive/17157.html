I've noticed in a few threads here and there when people mention some Apocalypse World playbooks I've never heard of, but mostly I paid it no mind until the other day when I came across Monster of the Week and purchased nearly on the spot. Giving it a quick read, it looks as amazing as any of the other games using the same core ideas as AW, and I'm excited to try it out at some point. Even more exciting is all of the expandability of the game in the form of different character types that you find in the genre, some of which I missed because I was a bit late to the party.<br/><br/>I would love to get my hands (or digital fingertips) on some of these, but I've got a few complications. I don't have much in the way of LE playbooks to trade; I think right now I have The Luchador, and that's it. I also don't have much in the way of gaining access to any of the others... in a week I move to Kazakhstan for my wife's job, so roleplaying in general and game cons in specific are off the menu for a while until we get settled. I do plan on playing via Skype with some of my friends back here in the States, but that might not be entirely doable with the time difference and variable quality of internet connections. I could try some one-on-one games with my wife, although that misses out on the group dynamics that these games encourage. I'll probably end up doing that anyway!<br/><br/>I also don't have much other game-related stuff to trade. I have a couple of poorly-formatted Ghost/Echo hacks that I've tried out (one for ninjas and one for The Mist/Silent Hill-inspired survival horror), and I've put together what I think is a great Dungeoneering hack of Danger Patrol Pocket... those all seem to be old news compared to the fresh newness of things like Monster of the Week, though. To be honest, I'd be glad to give copies of those away just to get feedback, let alone get fancy, well-formatted Monster of the Week playbooks in return.<br/><br/>I guess my point is this: I would like to be able to "trade" for some LE playbooks, but I have no idea what anyone would be interested in except other LE playbooks that I don't have. Has anyone else been in this situation? What other things, tangible or intangible, work well for trading? Should I try my hand at creating some of my own playbooks and trading those? Any other advice?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389265/#Comment_389265" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-04T22:05:24+00:00" title="September  4, 2012 10:05PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2012 10:34PM by horn_head_o.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Any of your hacks (regardless of how rough), one for one for official Action Scientist, Hard Case, Divine, Summoned, or Snoop.

I have yet to play MotW and only bought it recently (and traded out of my now-large AW playbook collection for it - you have cool custom stuff, with time you can totally get some trades if you work at it. We have a very large thread about it here, don't be afraid to bump it up).<br/>Action Scientist: A weird one for me, not totally sure about who I would say. Kind of a lot like early season Peter Bishop from Fringe - he does action and isn't the crazy mega mad scientist like Walter, but isn't all action.<br/>Hard Case: Oh man. Supernatural has had several of these as guest-hunters who are all about rampant violence - there was that recurring one from the early seasons, the black guy who was really dedicated to hunting vampires at any cost and being realy efficient at it? I'd say this is him. All about being able to beat up all of the things.<br/>Divine: A bit more badass version of Castiel from Supernatural, but he's pretty close. I mean when he was friends with Dean/Sam, of course.<br/>Summoned: Oh man I haven't a clue. He's a dude who's been summoned from beyond and has something crazy about his body (under look options we have a list of "Demonic Body, Elemental Body, Reptilian Body, Glassy Body, Almost Human Body"). He's gonna bring about the Apocalypse.<br/>Snoop: I don't have a character name in particular (Susan Rodriguez from Dresden Files maybe), but this is that gung-ho reporter who's always trying to get that perfect story to expose the monsters.<br/><br/>The custom ones are a little less clean, thanks to being fan affairs and not with official formatting.<br/>The Beat: A cop who's been out on the streets and knows what's out there. Karen Murphy from Dresden Files is a loose but not necessarily great example. Maybe her dad.<br/>Protege: Dean Winchester, when he's focused one getting rid of the evils instead of hunting down the yellow-eyed demon, so a lot of what he's like in the first season. Later, Sam Winchester is like this, once Dean starts getting tired of the life.<br/><br/>We have a remarkable lack of custom Dungeon World stuff being traded in my opinion. MH, MotW, and AW all have thriving trading groups, but very little DW. Put some stuff out there, and if you're really unsure about a specific move or how somethin works, ask! And then you've got some cool stuff to share. Putting out some loose or lacking work is fine if you're willing to work on it and improve (or at the very least to learn from the problems), so hey, it's worth it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389270/#Comment_389270" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-04T23:05:48+00:00" title="September  4, 2012 11:05PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            FYI:<br/>The Action Scientist is inspired by Atomic Robo, and to a lesser extent the other action scientists at Tesladyne.<br/>The Summoned is inspired by Hellboy.<br/>(The others are correct in the inspiration, although Larry Correia's Monster Hunter International stories also fed into the Hard Case).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots" title="dyjoots"><img alt="dyjoots" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots">dyjoots</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389293/#Comment_389293" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-05T07:49:47+00:00" title="September  5, 2012  7:49AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for all of the information.

I think a big difference between him and The Professional is that the Professional's Agency knows and supports his actions, while the Beat is using the department's resources without them knowing it's for monster-hunting.

Still, I don't mind trading you one of the things you want for that item, and if time is a sensitive issue I'll trade you another for a guarantee of getting that Necromancer (if you write it, I just mean something so I won't have to trade you a second thing for it later).<br/>A list of the MotW playbooks I have is up near the top of the page here. Just tell me which things you want most and I'll trade 'em.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mr%20Nay" title="Mr Nay"><img alt="Mr Nay" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/273/nRUY5LGFSSBD3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mr%20Nay">Mr Nay</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390405/#Comment_390405" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-16T07:47:56+00:00" title="September 16, 2012  7:47AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, how do you whisper?
