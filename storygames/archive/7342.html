These definitions are necessarily a bit vague, but the borders of a conflict situation are often explicit in play. For example, in D&amp;D surprise and initiative mechanics would herald the beginning of a combat conflict. <br/><br/>The problem with this design approach is that the two forms of resolution don't always interact very well. The GM was required to facilitate the translation, and numerous abuses crept their way in through that gap. Which led to design schools (often originating at the Forge) of focusing on conflict resolution, and hence eliminating the discord between resolving conflicts and tasks, by removing tasks. This implied traditional games used pure task resolution, a claim that doesn't hold up to detailed inspection (D&amp;D is one of many counter-examples). <br/><br/>What I've realized recently is that most of the games I've designed in the past 6 years have focused on task resolution, minimizing conflicts in the same way the many indie games minimize everything except conflicts. The result has been fun and highly functional games which barely resemble either traditional or typical indie games. <br/><br/>It is a strange and wondrous place, and I'm determined to continue exploring it. But I wonder whether there is room among story gamers and indie designers for it. <br/><br/>So tell me your thoughts on task-centered design or minimizing explicit conflicts in RPGs.<br/><br/>   - Mendel S.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162994/#Comment_162994" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-18T10:48:30+00:00" title="August 18, 2008 10:48AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 18, 2008 10:51AM by Jesse.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your definition of conflict resolution as defined at The Forge is incorrect.

There's the one you just said, which is the way it's defined in TSOY.  Then there's:<br/><br/>I don't know where this started:  Task focuses on whether characters can do stuff, conflict focuses on conflicts between players<br/><br/>Ron's definition:  Task focuses on whether or not a character can complete a task based on character effectiveness; conflict focuses on conflicts of interest between in-game entities, and how, when, why, and to what effect those conflicts resolve.<br/><br/>Vincent's definition:  Task doesn't have mechanics in place to resolve the relevant bits, conflict does.<br/><br/>As far as design goes, I'm inclined to think that only Vincent's distinction is important (although I stick to Ron's definition of the actual terms).  In other words, don't worry about "task" or "conflict," just make sure you have mechanics in place to resolve what's important.  Like, lemme paste from my blog:\n<blockquote>Player:  \u201cI punch him in the face!\u201d<br/>GM:  \u201cTo what purpose?\u201d<br/>Player:  \u201cTo hurt him!\u201d  (rolls dice; they say he hits)<br/>GM:  \u201cYou break his nose, and he starts bleeding!\u201d<br/><br/>The above example is an example of stupid.  You know why?  Because whether or not you hit the guy was not relevant.  All that was relevant was whether or not you hurt the guy.  <br/><br/>If you\u2019re not convinced that the above example was an example of stupid, here\u2019s another one:<br/><br/>Player:  \u201cI punch him in the face!\u201d<br/>GM:  \u201cTo what purpose?\u201d<br/>Player:  \u201cTo hurt him!\u201d  (rolls dice; they say he hits)<br/>GM:  \u201cYou hit him, but his jaw\u2019s like a rock.  It doesn\u2019t phase him.  And your hand hurts now.\u201d<br/><br/>If you were that player, you\u2019d probably feel pretty hacked off, right?  The relevant bit was whether or not you hurt the guy, but the dice (which are representing the mechanics conceptually here) didn\u2019t tell you that; there was no system in place for determining it.  The people playing the game had to implement an informal system for it themselves.  In this case, the GM decided.  That\u2019s called Fiat.  If you\u2019re going to resolve the relevant bits by GM Fiat, then why the hell are you rolling dice?  The rules tell you that the dice are the \u201cresolution mechanics,\u201d but don\u2019t resolve anything that matters.  Why are you using mechanics that lie to you?<br/><br/>Here\u2019s a thing:  GM Fiat can be functional and fun.  You\u2019ve probably played in a game where it was.  But it\u2019s prone to dysfunction, and you\u2019ve probably played in a game where it went bad.  The only reason for that is that it is rarely handled in an above-board fashion.  If you\u2019re going to resolve the relevant things by Fiat, then quit screwin\u2019 around with dice and crap, and just say so.  You know what happens when you do that?  BAM, you\u2019ve got a system in place to resolve the bits that are relevant. <br/><br/>Player:  \u201cI punch him in the face!\u201d<br/>GM:  \u201cTo what purpose?\u201d<br/>Player:  \u201cTo hurt him!\u201d  (looks at the GM expectantly)<br/>GM:   \u201cHm.  You break his nose!  He starts bleeding everywhere!  And now your hand hurts.\u201d<br/><br/>This whole issue is an issue of Effect, as in IIEE (Intent, Initiation, Execution, Effect).  If you don\u2019t have a handle on IIEE, don\u2019t worry, because it\u2019s not really important from a design standpoint, and it can go screw with task and conflict resolution.  Instead I\u2019ll be saying \u201cBig Effect,\u201d referring to the big fat concept of what the important effects of in-game actions are.  The first two examples lack Big Effect mechanics.  The third one has one.  The original rules for Vincent Baker\u2019s kill puppies for satan do not have Big Effect mechanics, but the annotated ones do.  D&amp;D has a curious mix of Big Effect and No Big Effect mechanics.<br/><br/>D&amp;D\u2019s combat rules have Big Effect, if the effect you\u2019re looking for is hurting someone.  You roll to hit then roll damage.  That\u2019s inelegant, of course, because whether or not you hit is irrelevant; we only care whether or not you did damage, and how much damage you did.  D&amp;D\u2019s designers would have done well to consolidate those into one roll.  But it gets fuzzier when you want to give someone a scar.  There\u2019s no systems in place for that.  D&amp;D\u2019s rules for picking locks have Big Effect, if the effect you\u2019re looking for is simply undoing a lock.  But it gets fuzzier when the effect you\u2019re looking for is actually getting a door open (the GM can always say it\u2019s jammed, even if you manage to unlock it).</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_163005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163005/#Comment_163005" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-18T11:28:21+00:00" title="August 18, 2008 11:28AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not talking about scale here.

The game "It's complicated" for example doesn't have any of them (the same it could be said of 1001 Nights, I think, but the case is not so clear-cut).<br/><br/>About Scale, I think it could be more useful talking about scale of NARRATION, not scale of resolution: the rules of the resolution system give someone (the GM, the player who won, the player who lost, the player who draw the higher card, etc.) the authority of "final word" in narrating something (under the limits given by the rule system). How big is this something? A single movement? A complex action? A situation? A scene? Unlimited? O, as in IAWA, potentially unlimited (you can narrate imprisoning your foe for 50 years...) but you have not the absolute last word (the limitation of narration doesn't happen on the level of scale, but on the level of acceptance from the other players)<br/><br/>I am making this distinction between narration and resolution because they can have scales and duration very different (for example, in DitV the effect of resolution are usually permanent)<br/><br/>[edit: crossposted 25 seconds after Mendel's post, that made the part about scale off-topic in this thread.

You have no conflict resolution by having no immediate conflict of interest. It's a solution that work with the genre (where everything is always left unsoluted until after the next commercial break or the next character narration) but not widely applicable.  As a mechanic, it's more interesting for me the one used in Spione, where there is "something" triggered by two concomitants conflicts (a flashpoint phase) that doesn't work as any "conflict resolution" system I know (it doesn't resolve the conflicts, it isn't limited to these conflict. If you can push a principal in conflict you can then use that phase to kill another character not involved in that conflict that isn't even physically there, for example) and give a kind of "literary narration" different from the one given by most conflict resolution rules (that give a kind of narration more cinematographic) <br/><br/>About IIEE, it isn't something that is to be applied to rpgs. Its equivalent in rpgs (how the rpgs rule parse resolution) is fortune in the middle or fortune in the end or drama at the end or whatever.<br/><br/>IIEE is about the fiction created. It's about how real life works. Everything has IIEE, even you writing your post.

Reducing confusion and clearing the questions is the opposite of going off-topic.<br/><br/>Returning to the OP questions:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wyrmwood</cite><br/>What I've realized recently is that most of the games I've designed in the past 6 years have focused on task resolution, minimizing conflicts in the same way the many indie games minimize everything except conflicts. The result has been fun and highly functional games which barely resemble either traditional or typical indie games.</blockquote>\nSeeing the OP confusion about forge terms, I am not sure that he would still call that "task resolution": it's about how fast your character run? You roll to see if you open a door? Or is something else? Something that doesn't simply say if a fictional character get to do a single task? I would like to see an example.\n<blockquote><br/>It is a strange and wondrous place, and I'm determined to continue exploring it. But I wonder whether there is room among story gamers and indie designers for it.</blockquote>\nWithout an example of "it", In this answer I consider "it" as "playing a game without conflict resolution". In this case, the answer is a very big "yes", not only there is room, but this room is already full of games. Spione, It's Complicated, 1001 Nights, Kazekami Kyoko Kills Kublai Khan, Breaking the Ice, etc... there are already a lot of indie games without conflict resolution (and no task resolution, either). Even Jeepform games are without conflict resolution mechanics of any kind. It's a little like asking "seeing rpgs only use dice, do you think there is room for games that use cards?"\n<blockquote><br/>So tell me your thoughts on task-centered design or minimizing explicit conflicts in RPGs.</blockquote>\nTwo very different things, task-centered design and minimizing explicit conficts in RPGs.<br/><br/>First, about task-centered design: I think it's broken. Period. It was a leftover from the old wargaming days, and the idea that the rules should have to follow a "realistic" sequence, associated with the idea that no gdr could work without being based on GM's fiat. Both axiom were demonstrated as false.<br/><br/>About conflicts in RPGs... I thought that it was impossible to have a rpg without conflict. Lately the Jeepen Frederick Berg Olsen did try to confute this axiom by writing the game "Lady &amp; Otto", where every form of conflict was prohibited. His experimental conclusions after having played the game with different people at various times  were (citing from memory, but you can find this in the notes about the game) "playing without conflict is possible, but it's mind-numbing boring" (and in some occasions I think the players got really angry at him during the game). From these test and observations, I would suggest that designing a rpg without conflict of any kind is at least unwise.<br/><br/>This doesn't mean that every conflict has to have people chopping at each other with big swords. Conflicts can be much more "life-like". I have played games where the only conflict was a growing tension between sentimental parters. Not something that you want to settle by "resolving" the conflict and deciding "who won". So it's perfectly possibile to have rpgs where the conflict is part of the "fruitful void", like these, or is of so little importance in the game to be narrated by someone as an little detail (as in "it' complicated"). Notice as these are two polar opposite extremes: in one case that conflict is so important to be put outside of the rules (this is a rare case in indie games. The thesis that they are all about conflicts is patently false. The most important core of a narrativist games is into the fruitful void, so if there are rules about conflict, that core CAN'T be that conflict. Usually is the reason WHY there is that conflict, or the decision of entering in conflict at all. The conflict is mean to a bigger goal), in the other case the conflicts are of so little importance to be considered by the rules in the category "you can narrate it the way you want" as if was the color of the socks of the character. Most Indie games are in the middle of these extremes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_163226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163226/#Comment_163226" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-19T08:22:53+00:00" title="August 19, 2008  8:22AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to be clear, I'm not using Forge terms incorrectly, I'm using terms in common parlance (among RPG designers) which happens to have several Forge definitions. That doesn't make the Forge definitions correct or even orthodox. (Indeed, the most orthodox definition of conflict resolution I've found is resolving conflicts between people - as it exists far beyond the scope of RPGs.)<br/><br/>It may help to go back to Sean's example. Here there is an implicit conflict (presumably structured and developed among the players) convincing a crowd to execute your brother. The two examples are two brands of conflict resolution. One piggy-back's directly on task resolution - resolving the conflict as a task. The other uses GM fiat to resolve the conflict, with (perhaps) plausibility constraints due to the tasks resolved during the conflict. Neither of these are very good types of conflict resolution. The former over-simplifies and essentially deflates the drama. The later is prone to serious abuse, although "good" GMs can make it very functional. <br/><br/>But the task resolution happens beneath that layer. It's task resolution because the implicit or explicit conflict is not being resolved, merely action within a larger context.<br/><br/>The games I'm talking about resolve the action, but delay or avoid resolving conflicts. In some cases this is because there is one real conflict, which is already resolved before play begins. In others it is because conflicts only resolve when they cease to be important, when the potential for interesting tasks has been exhausted. In others, (like Pure Shoujo) the tasks contribute to resolving relationships, not conflicts. I promise to get to a few more brass tacks on this shortly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_163238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163238/#Comment_163238" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-19T09:26:51+00:00" title="August 19, 2008  9:26AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mendel,<br/><br/>I like where you're going with this and very much agree with most of your sentiments. I also feel like, when you have a system that's conflict-focused, that's where you inevitably spend most of your table time. I have often felt great dissatisfaction with this in the Forge-style conflict-resolution-oriented games I've played: there's no context to the conflicts, because everyone races to the resolution point.<br/><br/>Personally, I'd be very interested in seeing a system that works at building the context of a conflict in a structured way. <br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_163267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163267/#Comment_163267" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-19T10:50:41+00:00" title="August 19, 2008 10:50AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 19, 2008 10:51AM by Moreno R..">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @ Mendel: I still think you are misusing forge terms (in the last post, more than ever: in Sean's example, A is Conflict resolution, B is task resolution, they are emphatically not two brand of conflict resolution. It's true that you have a conflict in the example, but in case B you don't address and resolve that conflict. The GM does). Seeing that the "common parlance" is in this case nothing but widespread misuse of forge-born terminology, it would be expected.  But it's useless to continue to debate terms if you disagree with me about this. it would only derail the thread. I think it would be much more fruitful, for the remainder of the thread, to talk about what you want (and build) into your games, using concrete examples without using jargon (as an example of misunderstandings caused by these terms: I don't think I understood what you wrote in your post about your games. Maybe i need an actual example)<br/><br/>@ Paul B: I don't think I have ever seen a forge game that forced the group to race to the resolution without context (I have seen instead forge games that simply don't work if you don't give context: Sorcerer and IAWA for example), it's simply a dysfunctional way of playing them that crept up (dysfunctional if you do it and you don't find it fun. If someone liked it I suppose it would be a functional drift. But in most of the cases is not the way these games should be played).<br/><br/>But don't think I am dismissing this problem: that way of playing them crept up because of game texts that often did a very bad job of explaining the games (and people had to discover the correct way by reading the game forum or the next edition), and in any case is a new, and turned around, version of a very old argument against forge games: it was "you don't need rules for this if you have a good GM". Now it's "you don't need rules or a teaching text about this, if every player in your group has a good grasp of pacing". It wasn't true then, and it's not true now. No game can play itself, so the players have to bring something themselves to the table to be able to play, but requiring an intuitive grasp of story pacing to be able to play it's little too much.  Instead of dismissing it, I think it's a very, very important subject that could be touched with a lot of different threads, each one on a different part of this problem, but raising it up in this thread risk drowning the initial topic (that, if I understood it correctly, was about a substantial difference in resolution mechanics, not in the way to explain them or in pacing mechanisms...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_163274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163274/#Comment_163274" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-19T11:05:09+00:00" title="August 19, 2008 11:05AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey all!<br/><br/>I'm very interested in this topic.<br/><br/>I'm not particularly interested in the "who-owns-the-word" discussion.<br/><br/>Mendel is working on something new -- at least it seems he is.  So, let's let him lay out what he's talking about.  No matter what words he uses <i>he's</i> defining them for the context of this conversation.  So, we're following along.<br/><br/>I do have a favor to ask: Just as I think we need to let go of arguing over the definitions of words (again, Mendel is defining his own context here), I ask that the terms "Forge games" or "Forge-style" or anything like that be struck from the conversation.   Such a label is utterly meaningless given the variety of resolution systems that might be implied.  How <i>Sorcerer</i>, <i>Primetime Adventures</i> and <i>Polaris</i> resolve something are so different from each other as to make any lump grouping like that useless as a reference.<br/><br/>So, Mendel, here's my thing.  Unless you start referencing specific games and specific mechanics I simply have no idea what you're taking about.  Or, rather, I think I know what you're talking about, but because you positing an idea that is the inverse of "Forge games" -- which can be so many things -- I get confused because I'm trying to figure out the opposite of what a "Forge game" resolution is -- and my head explodes.  Cause there is no opposite to a Forge game.<br/><br/>There might be specific mechanics from specific games you're talking about that you want to avoid or stand in contrast to for this discussion -- and if you use them as a reference point that would be great.  But right now I have no reference point other than Pure Soujuo -- which I am sadly not familiar with.  <br/><br/>But just as valuable would be positive examples of what you're talking about.  I know you said the brass tacks would be coming soon.<br/><br/>But this is a plea to everyone -- guys... nothing has been made clear yet at all.  It's a lot of smoke about Forge games -- whatever the heck that means in at the close of GenCon 2008. <br/><br/>When Mendel starts talking specifics then we might be able to have a great conversation about "task-centered design or minimizing explicit conflicts in RPGs."  Which I would love to have.  But until then there's nothing to do <i>but</i> argue about definitions.  Which is useless.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_163285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163285/#Comment_163285" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-19T11:33:52+00:00" title="August 19, 2008 11:33AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 19, 2008 11:34AM by Marshall Burns.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mendel,<br/><br/>I'm having a hard time getting a grasp on what exactly it is you're looking for.  So, lemme throw something out there, an description of play from one of my games, and you tell me where on your spectrum of thought it falls.<br/><br/>Let's say we're playing a game of The Rustbelt.  Your guy has a thing that my guy wants.<br/><br/>"Gimme the thing," I say.<br/>"No," you reply, and describe your guy tightening his grip on the thing.<br/>"I intimidate him!" I say, "I cow him with my fierce gaze."<br/><br/>We roll dice (Grizzled vs. Grizzled).  Let's say I win.  The GM asks you, "Do you Push or do you Give?"  Meaning, do you sacrifice resources to override your failure, or do you accept it.  Let's say you Give.  Now your guy is intimidated.<br/><br/>But you've still got the thing.<br/>"Gimme the thing before I crack your jaw," I say.<br/>"Go to hell," you reply, describing your guy's determination even though he's shaking in his boots.<br/>"I hurt him.  I punch him in the face!" I say.<br/>"I duck out of the way."<br/><br/>We roll dice (my Tough vs. your Slick).  I get an Advantage die because your guy is intimidated.  Let's say you win, and I Push.  I still manage to hit you, but let's say I break a few knuckles (these consequences are negotiated with the GM based on some rules).  Then we negotiate how you take the damage (based on some rules for this); let's say that I do indeed crack your jaw.<br/><br/>But you've still got the thing.<br/>"I hurt him back.  I kick his teeth in!" you say.<br/>"Wait," the GM says, "You're intimidated.  You'll have to overcome that before you can actively defy him."<br/>"Okay, now my guy is pissed off," you say, "he's gonna find the strength."  You challenge the intimidation effect, by doing a new Grizzled roll against my old one.  Let's say you lose again, but this time you Push, and negotiate the price with the GM; you pay in Tears, a non-consequential but limited resource expenditure.<br/>"<i>Now</i> I kick his teeth in!" you say.<br/>"I grab the thing and slip it out of his grasp," I say.<br/><br/>We have an opportunity to alter our intents.  Let's say we don't.  We roll (my Slick vs. your Tough).  You win the roll, so I get hurt; that's set in stone, and we'll negotiate the consequences of that in a minute.  Since our goals were not mutually exclusive, I have the opportunity to Push and still accomplish my goal.  Let's say I do, and I take more damage to pay for it.  Then we negotiate how I take the damage.  Let's say that the total damage is more than I'm willing to take in terms of injury or resources, and it's also enough to knock me out, so I go with that.<br/><br/>Now I've got the thing, I'm unconscious, and your jaw is cracked.  You take the thing from my unconscious arms and get the heck out of there.<br/><br/>By both Vincent's and Ron's definition, that's conflict resolution (and similar in lots of ways to conflict resolution in <i>Sorcerer</i>).  But the same rules are used for characters accomplishing things like breaking down doors, disarming explosives, climbing barbed wire fences, sneaking into compounds, etc., except that instead of an opposed roll, you face a target number.  But the Push/Give and negotiated consequences is all still there.  By Ron's definition (as I understand it), that's task resolution.  By Vincent's definition (as I understand it), it's conflict resolution.<br/><br/>So, Mendel, what would you consider it to be?  (Whatever you decide to call it, I won't argue with you; I'm just trying to get where we're speaking the same language.)  Is it anywhere in the neighborhood of what you're talking about?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_163382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163382/#Comment_163382" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-19T15:17:28+00:00" title="August 19, 2008  3:17PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wyrmwood</cite>Just to be clear, I'm not using Forge terms incorrectly, I'm using terms in common parlance (among RPG designers) which happens to have several Forge definitions.

At the base level, everything happens via direct task resolution. If you want to fight someone you roll under your prowess to injure them. Then he turns to the cute head of the kendo club, using style to catch her eye (with a bonus because being injured makes you sympathetic). She rebuffs him with her honor, but the cunning joker of the class has left a water bucket for her to trip on as she turns away. And so on. <br/><br/>Each player has one or more characters, and the game encourages turn about, chaos, and sudden scene changes, because of the second level. This is a card based mechanic which allows you to assert a relationship (romance, friendship, vile hatred, etc.) between one of your characters and any other character. Then the card is voted on. If you've convinced enough other players that the relationship is there, you gain a reward. You then replace the card you just used from the deck. Since most players have only a few options, the result is a frenzied race to set things up so you can play your cards. <br/><br/>Pure Shoujo is a simple example of functional task resolution. In this case it exploits how much can happen in task resolution without changing the higher level dynamics. The Pure Shoujo version of the example Sean had is exactly what I described - you either gave a great speech or you didn't. <br/><br/>I promise more examples are coming.<br/><br/>As far as questions:<br/><br/>Conflict focus encourages tendencies in play, rather than forcing them. It's especially important to look at how the game transforms as players engage with it. Soft mechanics and loose coupling within a game can have a far greater effect on how it is played than the hard and fixed rules. This is especially true when we move away from conflicts as a means of structuring our play. <br/><br/>Moreno, I'm perfectly willing to discuss the definition issues in whispers. I suspect it will come down to whether the GM fiat resolving conflicts is conflict resolution or not. <br/><br/>Marshall, I see that as conflict resolution, because of the context being a conflict which becomes resolved. Conflicts help to structure our stories and our play. Task resolution lets us play within, around or outside of them, moving pieces around and perhaps changing the situation in important ways. But conflict resolution resolves it. To put it another way, a task exists as I resolve it, a conflict exists whether or not I resolve it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_163391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163391/#Comment_163391" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-19T15:49:27+00:00" title="August 19, 2008  3:49PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, I can dig that.

The player chooses (based on the current situation) antagonists to roll against and adds their opposition (internal faults which they are trying to overcome). The outcomes of actions are nuanced. For example, in Sean's scenario of telling a speech to enrage the crowd against your brother the antagonists might be the crowd and your brother, while the opposition might include shyness and hormonal overdrive. Thus any of the following could occur:<br/><br/>If you defeat everything you could:<br/>a) have the crowd waylay your brother, defeating him (which you or another player could then spend a story point to have him escape)<br/>b) have the crowd move aside, letting you take your brother one on one, essentially defeating the crowd (and allowing you or another player to bring them back in force)<br/><br/>If you are defeated by the crowd (it rolled higher than your brother and you), you might learn that the opposite sex can be scary sometimes, helping to put in check your hormonal overdrive.<br/><br/>If you are defeated by your brother, you might learn to overcome some of your shyness in the rage of your shouting match with him. <br/><br/>If you defeated your brother and the crowd, but lost to your shyness then you might have made a great speech, but not enough people heard it.<br/><br/>If you defeated your brother and the crowd, but lost to your hormonal overdrive you might have been distracted in the midst of your passionate speech by a pretty face.<br/><br/>And if another player liked what you did, she or he could spend a story point to give you another go - expanding on the events by rolling the same action again. <br/><br/><br/>As far as questions:<br/><br/>Callan, we can discuss definitional matters through whispers if you like. As is, the lack of consistent definitions (Forge or otherwise) means we can argue about it indefinitely. And I would rather not swamp this thread with deep discussions on what makes a given definition valid or invalid. <br/><br/>Marshall, the punishment is part of what makes it conflict resolution (from my perspective), the take punishment or give focuses on the over-arching risk of punishment, being unable to affect the conflict. It's just like dropping a PC in D&amp;D combat, each edition makes the PC more likely to survive, but each reduces or eliminates their effect on the current combat. Certainly punishment is a bad outcome in general, but it seems the real pressure it exerts is to close a framed conflict - either by being pulled out of it or by leaving to avoid it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_163689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163689/#Comment_163689" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-20T10:31:53+00:00" title="August 20, 2008 10:31AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay.

If I choose to jump a chasm, and roll against the difficulty, is that a conflict...or a task?</blockquote>\nThis is going to be a weird answer: It depends on whether the chasm holds the same emotional weight from audience perspective as a character.  If, in the fiction, it feels like the chasm is actively opposing you in an intelligent way.  Then it's a conflict.  If it is merely a complicating obstacle on something that is REALLY opposing you, then it's a task.   Yes, this is a situation-to-situation, group-to-group, person-to-person, evaluation.<br/><br/>The true answer to "Is jumping the chasm a conflict" is, "I don't know."  You'd have to give me the entire fictional context and probably a good chunk of the social context as well.<br/><br/>It's the presence of in-fiction willful opposition that defines conflict.  Even if that willfulness is purely metaphoric.  I've assigned dice to an ordinary fire in Sorcerer and played it as a character in combat with a player.  Conflict resolution tells us which fictional entity's "will" wins out.<br/><br/>To stay with Mendel's examples.  In all of them I see a character in action and then a list of things that are "willfully" acting against that.  The dice then prioritize those things and we get a result.  I can't quite tell how that result gets interpreted but the dice definitely tells us which entities dominate over what other entities.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_163767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163767/#Comment_163767" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-20T13:17:20+00:00" title="August 20, 2008  1:17PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul,<br/>With the speech, something is at stake:  do you give a good speech, is it received well, does the crowd have a sudden outbreak of dysentery, all of that matters because we care whether or not the speech has an impact, and whether that impact is for good or ill or a mixture thereof.  I'd call that a conflict.  In fictional terms, you can be in conflict with the universe; sometimes it's <i>out to get you</i>.<br/><br/>Maybe there's people that wouldn't call that a conflict.  Okay, I can get on the same page with that.  Mendel, would you call it a conflict?<br/><br/>Lemme throw another system example out there, and you tell me what you'd call it.  This is from my game in development <i>American Wizards</i>.<br/><br/>When your character tries to do something, anybody (it's GMless) can say,"I think you need to roll for that."  So you pick dice from applicable stats and roll, counting "points" (rolls of 5 or higher on d6s through d20s).  For each effect you want to create in the game world, you need one point.  The other players can throw complications into the mix, imposing other effects that you have to create (meaning more points you need) or else stuff you don't want might happen.  If you don't come up with enough points, some of your effects fail.  You choose which ones.<br/><br/>Here's an example of what it looks like:<br/><br/>Carlo's guy is trying to cook a sausage.  Nancy says he needs to roll for it.<br/>Carlo:  "Okay, so I cook the sausage faster by enhancing the heat, using my Will."  No one has any problems to add; he rolls two successes, so the heat goes up and the sausage is charred.<br/>Nancy:  "The boiling grease in the pan is going to spatter onto Fred.  Boy, is he gonna be mad about that."<br/>Carlo:  "What?  No!  I prevent it from hitting him, by shoving him out of the way."<br/>Nancy:  "Okay, but the grease might--"  <br/>Carlo: "--And I'm careful to do it so that the grease won't hit me either."<br/>Nancy:  "Heheh.  But if you lose your focus, the heat will get out of control, and all the grease will probably catch fire."<br/>Carlo:  "Okay, so, I make an effort to maintain my focus on the flame too.  That's--how many was that?"<br/>Nancy:  "Three.  You need three points."<br/>Carlo activates his dice (let's say, a d8 from Vigor, a d10 from Will, a d6 from Grace, and a d12 from "Bond:  my pal Fred") and rolls; only two points!<br/>Carlo:  "Oh crap."<br/>Nancy:  "You got that right.  So, which one goes wrong?  Do you get spattered, or does Fred get spattered, or does the flame get out of control?  I'll give you this shiny red d20* if you let the stove catch fire."<br/><br/>*(players can also reward and/or bribe each other with "applause dice" that can be used for any purpose, but are spent once rolled)<br/><br/>Nancy says that Carlo needs to roll because, for some reason, cooking the sausage is important.  Maybe Carlo's working at a restaurant to help pay for tuition (the PCs are students at a wizard college), or maybe he's in a cooking class, or maybe he and Fred have their girlfriends over at their apartment for a double-date and they're cooking dinner.  Whatever it is, he has to cook a sausage, and it's important (to him) that he does it well.  Therefore, dice and complications and fallout come into play.<br/><br/>So, what would you call that?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_163794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163794/#Comment_163794" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-20T14:09:32+00:00" title="August 20, 2008  2:09PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse:<br/>Your post is an example of why I really favor ConRes referring to conflict between the players, as Callan mentions upthread.*<br/><br/>Simply put, fictional entities have no will to win out anything. With task res, there is generally at least the idea that there are quantifiable qualities to the fictional objects pitted against one another, and that the TaskRes measures that interaction.<br/><br/>To me, anyway, ConRes is more like:<br/><br/>Player 1 "I want Indiana Jones to fall offf the cliff and die"<br/>PLayer 2 "I want him to fall of the cliff, and live"<br/><br/>The "conflict" is really a matter of deciding which fork in the story occurs. It could reasonably be more tense or less, but it's about deciding about conflicts in the direction of the fiction between players, not about modelling interaction between qualities of the fictional creations.<br/><br/><br/>*Be warned, I'm agreeing with Callan.

If your game is not explicitly focused on creating stories there are lots and lots and lots of other axis to consider.  Look at all the tactical options in D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Indeed, to get back to the original poster's question, I think Task Resolution is most functional when all the obstacles are laid out in advance or otherwise have some limiter on them.<br/><br/>For example, consider a spy game where the player is trying to have his character infiltrate the enemy's base.  If someone (usually a GM) draws out the base in advance, placing all the locked doors, guards, security cameras and locks down their difficulties for dealing with them, then Task Resolution is awesome because each individual success or failure presents new challenges.

Note, that the same cannot be said about octaNe, which has very similar mechanics. <br/><br/><br/>As far as the whole "what is conflict resolution?" kerfluffle that happened since yesterday:<br/><br/>I really don't buy any definition of conflict resolution which necessitates the player's intent being known. That gives us weird problems like:<br/><br/>Conflict Resolution:<br/>Player: I attack an orc. <br/>GM: Um, which orc?<br/>Player: Huh? The left one.<br/>Player and GM do mechanic.<br/>GM: You hit the orc. (or GM: You miss the orc.)<br/>Player thinks: That resolves my burning desire to know if I'll hit the orc. <br/><br/>Task Resolution: <br/>(the same until)<br/>Player and GM do mechanic.<br/>GM: Purple monkeys fly out of your butt.<br/><br/>Unless:<br/>Player: Awesome! Monkeys did fly out of my butt. And. They. Are. Purple!! Are we talking lavender or more a royal purple?<br/><br/>Which switches them, at least from the perspective of Player. Perhaps from the perspective of the GM (who is also a player) the purple monkeys don't matter at all. <br/><br/>That's why I consider a conflict to have some beginning and ending communicated at the table. Whether it's hard and fast rules or more guidelines, the design should encapsulate the creation and resolution of a conflict to qualify as conflict resolution. Look at Dogs in the Vineyards, if dice are used it's a conflict. You never have one player thinking it's a conflict and another thinking it isn't. Likewise with D&amp;D combat (the original conflict resolution mechanic) the conflict begins with surprise/initiative and ends with the elimination of a side using task resolution mechanics. <br/><br/>Matters of fictional interest to one or more players can certainly exist without a conflict being generated and resolved. Indeed, something different in play can be experienced without churning the context of what matters so much. After all, if you only know how to resolve a conflict then you cannot explore what it is like to be within the conflict. Some games and stories are about how conflicts will be resolved. Others are not.<br/><br/>In a game like Coming of Age, your main conflict is to come of age, and that will happen. It's part of the fictional conceit of these stories. If we resolve that conflict then it's over. Instead we explore and experience that conflict, building, discovering, coming together to see the final ending, not when we force the resolution of the conflict, but when it has arrived as a natural conclusion to the story. <br/><br/>  - Mendel S.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164055/#Comment_164055" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T10:13:24+00:00" title="August 21, 2008 10:13AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>Conflict often generates interesting tension but it's not the only kind of interesting tension present in the game.

That's too small a box, especially if the word "force" implies two brains working in opposition. That's a way to bring the conversation back to "A ha! Conflict! I told you so!" And that's uninteresting to me.<br/><br/>Look at a Reiner Knizia board game. His systems are famous for giving you too many options and not enough time to do them all. So, yeah, you're trying to win the board game, so at an abstract level you've got player-v-player tension. But you don't just go straight to "two players roll dice, high die wins," right? The part that's interesting/fun about his board games is that you've got the problem-solving tension the game system itself presents: How do I do everything I want to do with the resources allotted to me?<br/><br/>Look at all the elements that make an interesting moment of play in an RPG. There's the description of the physical space. There's the fictional elements that are in danger. There's the element of exploration. There's all the fictional context that led up to this moment of play. There's the social context of players working both within themselves to create something cool, and working with (and against) each other. There's tactical/puzzle challenges to resolve. <br/><br/>Without letting this conversation spin off to theory-land, I'll just say that I believe RPGs have all kinds of interesting places to explore, still, that have nothing to do with who stabs whom in the face.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164072/#Comment_164072" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T10:34:38+00:00" title="August 21, 2008 10:34AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>The part that's interesting/fun about his board games is that you've got the problem-solving tension the game system itself presents: How do I do everything I want to do with the resources allotted to me?</blockquote>There is a reason I used the word "forces" and not "people" or "players" or what-have-you.

He answered "Dogs in the Vineyards, Prime Time Adventures, and In a Wicked Age all jump to mind fairly easily"  (He also offered to start talking about it publicly, which is why I feel comfortable posting his answer out in public here.)<br/><br/>I bring this up because -- at this moment at least -- I'm with Jesse when he asks, "Does anyone DO that, though?"  Which is why I asked Mendel for the examples.  I thought I saw what Mendel wanted to avoid, but I couldn't wrap my head around games that do what I thought he was describing as Conflict.<br/><br/>Now, I know some people use, for example, the conflict mechanic in <i>PtA</i> to resolve huge conflicts in a fell swoop.  But I don't think that's how the rules are written, nor is how I work it as a Producer.  As an example, in one game I had a guy who's Issue was "Maniacally Obsessed with Scientific Research"  In his first conflict he was working on some blueprints, is girlfriend knocked on his door, and the conflict was -- does he tear himself away from his work to answer the door?  He failed.  The girl left in tears.  And it was the beginning of a larger scale conflict of the sort (I think) Mendal is talking about that we could not have anticipated hat carried over several scenes.<br/><br/>And <i>In a Wicked Age...</i> doesn't do (what I think) Mendel is describing either.  One character says, "Take off your medallion!"  The other says, "Go away old man!"  The first character continues shouting at the character wearing the medallion until the character wearing the medallion shouts, "That's enough old man!" and steps forward to beat the old man down.  The player playing the old man says, "Not so fast" and we have a series of specific actions, one after another, that can spin off in several directions that no one can anticipate. And, in fact, the third round might roll around before either character is ready to give up... which means the actions continue.  Now, the fact that some players play it as a conflict resolution as Mendel describes conflict ("We're resolving the tension between the Queen and the Guard right now!") doesn't mean that's how Vincent meant it to be played, nor how I play it.<br/><br/>I do think what Mendal is trying to avoid <i>does</i> happen.  It's part of the whole "Stakes That are Too Broad" thing many of us decry.  But that doesn't make it what is in the rules or how the games are played by many people.<br/><br/>So, Mendel, again, I'm only catching up here, and might be way off base in my assumptions about what you're talking about.  So if you could make course corrections on what I've written and/or assumed, that would be great.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164088/#Comment_164088" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T11:02:29+00:00" title="August 21, 2008 11:02AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 21, 2008 11:12AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oops...

I've seen it happen in <i>Primetime Adventures</i> and In a <i>Wicked Age...</i> for example, as mentioned above.<br/><br/>However, I'll stand by my statement that those broad conflict resolutions are playing the game <i>wrong</i> and I work tirelessly to stamp out such play whenever dice are brought out in public.<br/><br/>So, as far as I can tell I'm agreeing with Mendel's agenda (again, only Mendel can tell me if I'm right on that), but I see this less as a matter of rules and more of what people are doing with rules that can be bent to do something that Mendel and I both think isn't particularly fun. <br/><br/>That's what I've got so far.<br/><br/>I should add, also, that Jesse referred to the matter of solving Big Issues with a single resolution widget.  I'm against that as well, but I'm even more sensitive: I'm allergic to the notion of laying out all the details of the resolution of a specific conflict with a resolution widget.

I get what you're saying.<br/><br/>In practice, such play always seems -- to me at least -- to be lacking in color, detail, specificity, interesting turns and twists as the conflict moves forward, revelation of character, discovery of new details about the world and the behavior of the character.<br/><br/>In my view, the point of putting a character in a situation of a conflict (of any kind, of any stripe, however we're defining it, and by that I mean Mendels examples above are full of conflict whether or not they are Conflict Resolution under his definition) is precisely to reveal color, detail, specificity, providing the opportunity for turns and twists, revelation of character, and discovery of the world and the behavior of the characters.  <br/><br/>In other words, <i>the point of conflict is not to resolve the conflict, it's to elicit more narrative stuff.</i><br/><br/>But, that's me.  And I think that's what Mendel is getting at, as well.<br/><br/>In any case, it is why I'm interested in this thread.<br/><br/>EDITED TO ADD: As mentioned above, conflict, resolution, and the context of these concepts vary depending on the agenda of the game.  Everything I'm saying here is the context of my preference of RPGs as story-making tools.  As a counter-example, I love the resolution mechanic of <i>Diplomacy</i>:  it provides all sorts of twists and turns in one's calculations and anticipation of what might happen, but when it's time to resolve the conflict -- bam, the conflict is resolved through a series of comparisons of troop values and you move on.  There's clearly no adding of narrative stuff. It's all about establishing a situation for the next round of negotiations. Different games, different agendas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164156/#Comment_164156" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T12:54:46+00:00" title="August 21, 2008 12:54PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The main point I had about conflict was actually that they have a communicated initiation - there is a process in play where the importance of some matter is communicated to all players and thus a conflict has begun. Then sometime later it is resolved, again in a communicated way. Mechanics must enable this communication, even if it is a soft mechanic (like all players discuss the stakes). Without this process there may be resolution which happens to resolve a conflict (from someone's perspective), but calling that conflict resolution is like calling the D&amp;D skill roll "mountain climbing resolutions", since in some situations it resolves mountain climbing. <br/><br/>But as far as broad conflicts, they are only problematic because of the pace with which conflict-focused games resolve conflicts. A broad conflict which remains unresolved for an entire session or even many sessions is a wealth of opportunity. But to do this you must have a means of resolving matters which are not limited to resolving the conflicts you care about. <br/><br/>Which suggests people are either playing the game wrong or playing the wrong game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164166/#Comment_164166" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T13:05:39+00:00" title="August 21, 2008  1:05PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 21, 2008 1:06PM by Jesse.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wyrmwood</cite>A broad conflict which remains unresolved for an entire session or even many sessions is a wealth of opportunity.

I completely disagree with your second statement.<br/><br/>Consider the Primetime Adventures game I played where I had a player whose character Issue was "Independence."  The setting was 18th Century and so being an independent woman was an issue.  She had a love interest who was also her Nemesis because he threated her desire for Independence.<br/><br/>In TWO ENTIRE seasons of the game, approximately 14 sessions, we never really fully resolved that "conflict."  She and her love interest clashed (i.e had conflicts) many times and the cards came out and resolved those clashes beautifully.  But that higher level situational conflict?  No cards were ever played about that.  Nor would we have wanted them to.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164175/#Comment_164175" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T13:16:44+00:00" title="August 21, 2008  1:16PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse, Independence was an issue, not a conflict.

You did not resolve a conflict you cared about while still resolving matters. The only difference is you restricted the matters that you could resolve to other conflicts. <br/><br/>Consider the analogy of poetry. Different systems are like different languages. Some use very similar structures - like conflicts to organize the language. Thus the poems of that game will be distinctive. I have observed (carrying forward the analogy) that conflict-minimizing games act as a distinctly different language, giving different sorts of poetry. You seem to insist that any worthwhile poem from that language can be translated, word for word as it were, to a conflict-focused language. I'm insisting that this may very well be true, but your translation is no longer the same poem. <br/><br/>  - Mendel S.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164182/#Comment_164182" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T13:33:52+00:00" title="August 21, 2008  1:33PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wyrmwood</cite><br/>Consider the analogy of poetry.

I engage the system to see if I climb the fence.  It <em>doesn't matter</em> if anybody else at the table cares if I climb the fence; the procedure is still the same.  I engage the system for any of a number of reasons.  I might engage the system because by doing so I gain game currency.  I might engage the system because that calls attention to the fence-climbing.  I might engage the system to punctuate my otherwise non-mechanical narration.  I might even engage the system because somebody doesn't want me to climb the fence (in which case TR encapsulates CR).  At no point is the investment of other players a necessary component of me engaging the system.  Now, <em>as a result of me engaging the system,</em> other players may become interested in the fence-climbing, but that's immaterial.

And you and I might not be those players.  To ask Mendel or Josh or anyone to justify outside of an actual experience why it might be interesting is going to be weird -- and will produce a lot of thread whirling.  Josh has laid out it might be interesting to some folks to roll a die and say they climbed a fence.  It isn't up to you or I to say it isn't interesting or fun.<br/><br/>The second answer is: Mendel has posted a TON of games on his site.  We are at the point -- a point we all often reach -- where we have to pick up the game and read it.  And most likely play it. Because for all we know climbing that fence in the context of Mendel's interlocking rules might be a blast.  Until we play the game, we don't know.<br/><br/><br/>Mendel,<br/><br/>I think I understand what you're getting at now.  But still confused, if only because the problems you are describing about conflicts being truncated because of conflict mechanics doesn't seem to exist in my sessions of play.  The conflicts (using conflict resolution) in my games of <i>Sorcerer</i>, <i>In A Wicked Age...</i>, or <i>Primetime Adventures</i>, for example, only generate the next set of conflicts within the larger conflict.  Or the conflicts end and a new turn or new path in the larger conflict is opened-up, reversed, or accelerated in unexpected ways.  The larger conflicts are never settled easily and quickly by one conflict resolution.<br/><br/>Which is me saying I'm pretty sure I'm still missing something, and I'll be reading along.  But I appreciate you taking the time to explain thus far.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164373/#Comment_164373" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-22T08:23:07+00:00" title="August 22, 2008  8:23AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>I guess what I'm saying is you want to climb the fence so you engage the system.

"What's interesting about the fence" is irrelevant to task resolution, because task resolution doesn't resolve "what's interesting about the fence."  It resolves me getting over the fence.  Much like conflict resolution cares more about what's interesting about the fence and not so much about whether I get over the fence \u2014 since CR might generate a result like, "You almost get to the top of the fence but fall, and Jerry takes pity on you and stops chasing you."<br/><br/>Task resolution does not resolve conflicts between players.  At all.  What it might do is <em>lend credence</em> to proposed resolution ("I cleared the fence, so Jerry will probably stop chasing me now."), but the resolution of the conflict is still in the hands of the consensus of the players.<br/><br/>I think CK's half-right; reading examples may help, but I think <em>playing</em> would be even better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164410/#Comment_164410" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-22T10:58:22+00:00" title="August 22, 2008 10:58AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2008 10:58AM by Max Higley.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having seen the clarifications, try this on for size as a local definition:<br/>"Task resolution" is about external stuff.<br/>"Conflict resolution" is about internal stuff.<br/><br/>Do I successfully climb the fence?

And, more importantly significance is joined with the resolution of a conflict. In the extreme case, no events are even considered other than initiating and resolving a conflict. But even avoiding that extreme case, conflict-focus imposes a particular structure, namely a sequence of conflicts. <br/><br/>Jesse, this affects both the fictional story produced and the experience of the players in the game. <br/><br/>In designing conflict-minimizing RPGs, I'm not claiming conflict resolution is inherently flawed or any such polemic. I'm simply arguing that it isn't the only avenue we have available. If small conflicts no longer structure the story, then we are free to choose other structures, whether socially or by design. For example, Coming of Age can be viewed as a gradual 3-4 hour resolution of a single conflict, with setbacks, victories, comic relief, and surprises all mixed in by the social interactions and the mechanics. But that duration and breadth give a feeling of elation and victory by the end, even though the outcome of the conflict was never in doubt. <br/><br/>Josh, I think you've hit it right on the nose. Task resolution does not require the players to first set up a conflict context for the action, only that the action be credible. <br/><br/>Max, I don't think that works too well. After all, the conflict you mentioned doesn't resolve the conflicting desires, only the outcome of a conflict of desires. <br/><br/>I'll be posting my fourth example shortly, Homeworld Project. It's one of the games where I intentionally designed a game independent of conflicts, rather than simply exploring the potential of task resolution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164984/#Comment_164984" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T12:57:30+00:00" title="August 25, 2008 12:57PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wyrmwood</cite>Josh, I think you've hit it right on the nose.

(Which I'm glad about, because really -- I'm not trying to pooh-pooh anything that's being discussed here. Because I really have been thinking about this matter and I'm shaping my thinking with this thread.)<br/><br/>This clarifies where my brain has been going -- it's not about whether or not the conflict is resolved (because who know if it will be?).  It's the, "Okay, now we're heading for a conflict," model that some games work with.  It's what you shape game play toward, it's a big deal to the game, it's often when "the rules" kick in...  I see pluses and minuses to this structuring, and I'm looking forward to seeing where this thread goes.<br/><br/>Thanks again.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd" title="SweeneyTodd"><img alt="SweeneyTodd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd">SweeneyTodd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164999/#Comment_164999" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T13:50:32+00:00" title="August 25, 2008  1:50PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just wanted to chime in and say I'm amazed -- I thought this thread was just going to be arguing in circles, simply because this particular topic never seems to do well anywhere, and I was pleasantly disappointed.<br/><br/>There's a lot of ideas to be gleaned here, and thanks for that.

In terms of mechanical and narrative structure it is both precise and highly flexible - each piece acts on each other - making it like a M\xf6bius loop of system. The premise of the game is Astral Space Opera, playing operatic stories in a world more permissive than even space opera tends to be. The model of the game is literary, so it is spaced into chapters, with a rising drama leading to a cliffhanger-type turning point for each. During the course of the design I specifically wanted to move away from the scene-structures which have become so pervasive in RPG design. Thus Homeworld Project has a narrative structure called, the action. The idea is anything worthwhile happens in the action, and characters are not so much killed as removed from the action. Another principle of the action is that anything in the action can, in principle, affect anything else. That's one place where the _astral_ space aspect of the game comes in handy. <br/><br/>At the core of Homeworld Project are bouts, which take place between two entities in the action. These could be people, ships, space storms, rioting crowds, etc - but always something which a player (including the GM) has imbued with some of their limited resources. All that is required for a bout is how the entities are describe initiating the interaction. Then dice (d12s) are rolled or progressed, with the winner (if any) generally describing a consequence for the loser - rated by the difference of the two rolls. Other mechanics can allow the dice to be progressed further during a bout or alter the rating of a consequence. Still other mechanics (such as "narrative wounds") affect the description of initiating the bout. These bouts likewise affect the pacing of the story (every 1 or 12 brings the chapter closer to an end and ramps up the drama level). The values rolled often indicate what the next value for that entity will be (dice are not cleared after being rolled and as the drama increases dice tend to increase or decrease by 1 rather than being rolled).<br/><br/>Another core of the system are grains, which belong to characters and ships (of the PCs) and are mirrored in the GMs resources, which are called reflections. Multiple grains can share the same reflection, which links them all. Grains are the mechanical representation of what a player's character is about, while reflections represent how this links with something in the larger world. A reflection is also what a player wants to achieve. Grains are a metaphor for the grain in the center of a pearl, as each layer is added, something beautiful or terrible comes closer to its own existence. At the 13th layer a reflection takes on an existence apart from the players, becoming a fixture rather than a central part of the story. This could mean finding the lost treasure or the success of the slave rebellion. Grain (and reflection) layers are used to bring in manifests (supporting characters and other entities), affect consequence ratings, or progress dice. If a layer progresses a die to 1 one layer is lost from that grain, if it progresses a die to a 12 the grain likewise gains (or regains) a layer. <br/><br/>The result (from playtests) has been a game of building drama, where turning points may re-envision the core conflicts described by reflections but they remain on-going twisting and turning back on themselves till the 13th layer is reached.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165786/#Comment_165786" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T13:56:40+00:00" title="August 27, 2008  1:56PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Request for clarification: which kind of resolution is that, and why?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165799/#Comment_165799" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T14:38:12+00:00" title="August 27, 2008  2:38PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mendel,<br/>\n  To answer your original question, I think "good" Task Resolution is one where "nothing happens" is not a "result" of using it...<br/>\n  Does that make sense?<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165958/#Comment_165958" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-28T12:28:13+00:00" title="August 28, 2008 12:28PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Max,<br/><br/>It's task resolution. Bouts can presumably be drifted to include initiating a conflict, but there are no guarantees of resolving it. Likewise much of the structure of the game works orthogonally to the presence of specific conflicts. And (for reasons I've stated as well as others) the resolution of a reflection often ends up being the resolution of a conflict which was most likely quite different than what you thought you had initiated. <br/><br/>Dave,<br/><br/>I'd agree that it at least helps. Remember though, this is almost always true about the games which have classic complaints about task resolution. That's because of cultural drift to equate a failed action with a non-event. If you fail a task, that adds to the fiction that you failed at the task, even if you immediately try again and succeed. But many players (due to whiff factor problems) edit out the initial failures, making failure become a non-event. That's one interesting case where poor or narrow design (it could really be either) causes drift into less functional play. <br/><br/><br/>   - Mendel S.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166115/#Comment_166115" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-29T10:46:33+00:00" title="August 29, 2008 10:46AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wyrmwood</cite>It's task resolution.

As far as I can see (and I'm probably missing something), that doesn't automatically make it task resolution.  What task does it resolve?<br/><br/>From reading the description, it sounds like the bouts are initiated without an end point in mind.  It seems like the question it answers is along the lines of "This is what I do.  What happens?" as opposed to "This is what I'm trying to do.  What happens?"  I think of the latter as task resolution because it has a goal to be accomplished.  The former doesn't seem to have any specific accomplishment in mind -- I don't see a task.<br/><br/>All that, in my mind, makes this some kind of resolution that is neither task nor conflict resolution.  And that makes it <i>far more interesting</i> to me.  But like I said, perhaps I'm missing something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7342/conflict-resolution-my-ancient-foe" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7342/conflict-resolution-my-ancient-foe" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7342/conflict-resolution-my-ancient-foe/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F7342%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F7342%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
