I hadn't played an RPG in years, let alone XP, and the game group consisted of 4 guys other than myself, all of which I met over Xbox Live (2 with extensive RPG experience, 1 of them with Paranoia experience, and 2 without any RPG experience). Wave was working pretty well, but after a few weeks we all wanted more and moved to playing over Ventrilo.<br/><br/>We played out the mission in 3, 3 hour sessions over 3 weeks. Play was very focused, but it did take time for us all to get used to using Ventrilo, Google Docs, and an online die roller to manage everything. I was very upfront with my ideas about what the game was about and took time to explain to the newbies what RPGs in general were about, basically using the "negotiated imagination" definition. I stressed that the focus would be on inter-party conflict rather than dealing with the incompetence of Alpha Complex citizens.<br/><br/><b>Play Structure Issues &amp; Comments</b><br/> * During the first session, I noticed that the new players weren't sure about when to jump in in terms of providing their feedback. By the second session, I moved to a very structured, "here's what happens, what do you do" and went around the "table" with the players revising as need be. I was very surprised to see how much this improved contributions all around. I was also surprised to see that I never got a response of "I do nothing" using this technique.<br/><br/> * In the first live session, I asked his player to narrate the success of his action, mostly because I was busy managing something else. I got a response of, "Isn't that your job?" by one of the veterans. I sent an email out after the session saying that players can narrate their success and failures if they wish (I would put on the brakes as need be). If they didn't, I would handle it. I started to see a lot more player narration by the third session. I used explicit stake setting most of the time and no one overstepped their bounds in the narration. I think they started to really enjoy it once they realized that since they know what they want their characters to accomplish better than they can explain it to me, they could get exactly what they wanted.<br/><br/> * More on the stake setting: I had some resistance on this one by the two vets in terms of setting the stakes for failure. They, and myself, were used to saying what you wanted to do, checking, and then dealing with whatever failure the GM might dish out. I always hated that, so I put that stuff up front. Sometimes I was a little less explicit, but no one was in the dark. After the initial shock, this worked out very nicely. The new players especially took to it. In fact, they were the only ones he asked for any renegotiation of given stakes.<br/><br/> * Even though Mr. Bubbles is very "on the rails", I was pretty open to whatever the players wanted to try. This was a big step for me. I used to beat players over the head to get them to do what I wanted. There were still parts in this one where I needed them to be certain places, but I stepped out of game here and there to let them no that and no one batted an eye. I was surprised how crazy things got when I opened it up. We had a reactor meltdown that destroyed a substantial part of the "mission space" and the death of a major NPC! I would have freaked out in my younger days.<br/><br/> * I tried to never say no unless a player proposed action went against previously established facts or a setting convention. I was successful about 95% of the time. Players were allowed to try anything. I think the vets were a bit surprised. They kept asking, "Would it be possible to do this?" I just kept saying, "Roll." The newbies didn't find this odd at all. They started using the skills they were strong in to try and solve problems in all sorts of creative ways rather than trying to figure out which skill best "fit". This produced some of the funniest moments in the game. I did throw in a few checks though that I knew some of the players would have a hard time with. This was more for laughs than anything.<br/><br/> * I didn't fudge any rolls. I didn't see the need.<br/><br/> * The players were very hesitant to go after each other at first. I used their secret society contacts to really push the tension and create targets. This worked very well. I still need to impress upon them that they will not get anywhere in terms of improving their character's lifestyles without taking advantage of everyone around them, but that's a bigger picture thing I think.<br/><br/> <b>Game Specific Issues &amp; Comments</b><br/> * The resolution rules worked just fine with one exception. Access is a redundant piece as far as I can tell. In all the situations it would have turned out to be useful, it seemed just as useful to use a skill instead. Was this in the second edition (can't remember)? I also didn't like how it served as Treason Armor. I have 2 players with 3 Access and 1 with a 4. That's way too much armor in my opinion. In any case, why doesn't security clearance play into the Treason Armor thing instead of Access since that measures The Computer's trust? I mean, it's suggested that Access gets bumped up when a character goes up a clearance, but it all seems unnecessary.<br/><br/> * Mr. Bubbles is not a good introductory adventure. It subverts the standard mission structure, which is fine, but makes no sense for new people. My players did not "get" the the IR market scene at all.<br/><br/><b>Other Thoughts</b><br/>This whole thing was an experiment for me. GM abuse and lack of transparency drove me away from RPGs back in the day. I wanted to run a game using some of the techniques I've read about to open things up and put a stronger emphasis on the <i>game</i>. I picked Paranoia because it requires little up front work for the players and I've always loved the premise, but I was concerned that some of the techniques I wanted to use would hurt the mood. This did not seem to be the case. That reactor meltdown and NPC death were the direct results of the players being paranoid as the NPC and the R&amp;D lab that was destroyed had nothing to do with the Mr. Bubbles virus. We had 2 players lose 1 clone, 1 player lose 2, and another get a red "A" tattooed on his forehead (for assault, 6 weeks censure). One of the characters now has a Blue clearance mortal enemy and two of the characters are really at each other's throats. More clones would have been lost, but I'm using Straight mode's standards of evidence. Mission accomplished.<br/><br/>Another part of the experiment involved seeing if I could have fun doing something else with these guys other than player video games. I mean, I know some of them for more than two years now, but we've only played over Live. This was a major success. We BSed before and after the games, and one of the vets who swore who would never role-play again will be running a Shadowrun game for us starting in a few weeks. We've also talked about starting another RPG night where we would play some of the hippy stuff I own (though I don't sell it to them as that).<br/><br/>I know this is long and a bit rambly, but there you have it. I'm back in the hobby now and it feels very good to run a game and not be so fearful of letting go.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nick_Dalton" title="Nick_Dalton"><img alt="Nick_Dalton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dreadcentral.com/img/news/aug06/garthmarenghi2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nick_Dalton">Nick_Dalton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270906/#Comment_270906" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-13T06:53:47+00:00" title="May 13, 2010  6:53AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2010 6:59AM by Nick_Dalton.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess I should say what the mission was about:<br/><br/>The PCs are on their way to one mission. They get waylaid but don't know it. Instead of going to PLC outfitting, they end up in an IR market where every seller pretends to be an outfitter. Leaving there, they save a citizen being attacked by a scrubot. The citizen thanks them and gets their names. He sells their names to a vat shift supervisor. The supervisor has been sending spam from names he gets. Some Computer Phreak got tired of getting spam, so he wrote a virus that causes scrub bots to clean spammers to death. The players get asked to start in a reality show called Shooters where they all played roles like 'cyborg from the future' and 'wolveboy'. They are told to investigate the death of the previously mentioned shift supervisor. They find out who's been sending the virus and that their names were sold. They go after the guy that sold their names. He's in an R&amp;D lab and they are conned into trying some of the gear out. After that, they are chased by a scrub bot horde and have to flee on transitions. They get to their briefing room and are asked to remark on the mission they didn't go on.<br/><br/>Some of that stuff didn't work so well. The players had fun browsing and haggling at the IR market, but they didn't get that they were supposed to feel burned. Playing roles for the reality show was okay. There was a lot of "posturing" that one of the vets was into. One newbie didn't get into it at all and the other did some really funny stuff in his role that created setbacks for the group. Testing the R&amp;D stuff didn't work well either because there wasn't really a compelling reason to use it in a desperate situation. That may have been my fault though. The debriefing was also a bit flat. There was no reason for the players to try to throw each other to the wolves, because as it's setup, the debriefer just writes down what the first person says and leaves with no consequence.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nick_Dalton" title="Nick_Dalton"><img alt="Nick_Dalton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dreadcentral.com/img/news/aug06/garthmarenghi2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nick_Dalton">Nick_Dalton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271371/#Comment_271371" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-15T07:43:06+00:00" title="May 15, 2010  7:43AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2010 7:47AM by Nick_Dalton.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No one has any comments?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
