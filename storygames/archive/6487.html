No CSI antics or physical clues, just a lot of interviews and stakeouts and blackboard diagramming a la "The Wire."  Anything that drove characters to talk to each other and to discuss their theories was positive, because it was always part of a continuing process that led to interesting play rather than a puzzle piece.<br/><br/>What didn't work: not having an authority who the crime-solvers could work against.  We tried letting people generate their own solutions as they went along, and while from a long way away it <i>might</i> look like a satisfying mystery story if you squint your eyes and pretend a lot, it really wasn't.  Players who got off on solving a mystery didn't feel like they'd solved a damn thing, because what they were doing was <i>writing</i> a mystery rather than solving one.  At some point, someone's got to know who the criminal is, and has to be able to answer an investigator's questions: if you just let other investigators answer those questions (or, worse yet, force the investigator himself to answer his own questions), it pretty much blows for anyone who gave a crap about whodunnit.<br/><br/>(You might -- emphasis on "might" -- be able to fake authority with the mechanics and get around the "I don't want to answer my own question" problem that way.  Just be aware that to some players, this won't deliver what they want out of a mystery game; if you've got people in your group who want the investigation part of a mystery story, then nothing short of someone else giving them something to investigate will satisfy them.)                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143683/#Comment_143683" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-13T08:41:02+00:00" title="May 13, 2008  8:41AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2008 8:41AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh, that's the Czege Principle.

A game about detectives solving murders. Perfectly what we're talking about here. <br/>\n<br/>\nNote that Laws solves this by requiring the GM to come up with the plot. What Gumshoe does, then, is to allow any plan to discern the plot to work. But the players still have to ask questions, and there's still something to discover.

Basically, use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning" rel="nofollow">abduction</a>, not deduction or induction. Give them the crime scene (facts) and have in mind the perp and motive (solution)... then let the players suggest clues that seem logical to them and "look for them", and if the clues wouldn't violate the solution, Say Yes.<br/><br/>I can never find the thread which first presented this as a method for LARP mysteries, but here's a quote of my most-recent description of in-game play:\n<blockquote>Basically, rather than create a situation and a bunch of clues seeded into the venue space which necessarily and rigidly lead to a solution (the method and culprit), you ONLY make the situation and solution. There's a body on the floor, and one of the players put it there against its former occupant's will.<br/><br/>Then, the players will spend the game time positing cases that fit the situation, and then search for "clues" that fit the case. To complicate matters, each character will be enmeshed in a matrix of relationships with each other: they all know something about the others and (of course) themselves. (Refer to Long Live the King, by White Wolf, for a great example of such a matrix.) That matrix of relationships, further, will *seem* to provide clues. I say *seem* because you haven't made any clues, and 90% of the information they know about each other is color... red herrings at best. But such seeds will give the players ideas for what clues they should expect to find to fit a case they are building; they will get the player's fingers pointing!<br/><br/>Here's where the cool part happens: you know the solution, so you can--on the fly--judge whether or not it makes sense that a give "clue" that the players want to search for would be found. You can keep track of the clues if you want, but you don't HAVE to do so if you are very clear on the solution and, thus, are easily able to validate whether or not a posited clue would "work." No, rather, the players need to keep track of them... while the culprit is busily throwing up doubt, "misremembering" clues, and doing everything in his or her power to shift the blame and overemphasize meaningless details.<br/><br/>As should be obvious, your choice of culprit must be one of your better players. It is not a role suited to random assignment. (In a long-running LARP--which is what the original thread was about--the culprit would likely be a GM-as-NPC.) This person will have to be sneaky without being obviously sneaky; they will have to act without being seen as acting. Real Role Playing.<br/><br/>To conclude the mystery, have someone (the host, you) represent some form of authority figure: the local constable, the county sheriff, the executor of the deceased's will. The mystery is "solved" when the players have accumulated enough posited-and-thereby-found clues that they can provide a lock-tight logical explanation of events that equals the solution--the "test of law," so to speak. At that point, you can have the culprit deliver his or her "and it would have worked without those meddling kids" speech and call it a game, or you can move it on to some form of "chase" mechanics: for example, a game of "Slippery Jim" where either the culprit has to get out of the venue without being seen or must hide in the venue until some predetermined time (end of game). Such a "chase" makes for more physical play without actual risk to players, and it's a bit more visceral or "appropriate" to modern sensibilities than having the culprit grudgingly admit his guilt and mutter under his breath while being lead off by the police (that's so 50s!).<br/><br/>Long post short: don't waste your time railroading the players through an Easter egg hunt that, at the end, might still leave them with no idea about the solution. Instead, let them use their own creativity to "invent" the clues they need to fill in the blanks and end up with the solution and the culprit you assigned.<br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143744/#Comment_143744" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-13T12:19:07+00:00" title="May 13, 2008 12:19PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting, David. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes it work if the players know that's how it works? I mean... if you're a clever player, and you realize that you're making up the solution, are there degenerate strategies? <br/>\n<br/>\nLet's say that we have a body, murdered by a knife.

I'll try to be brief (HA!).<br/><br/>Yes, I assume the players know how it's working. It becomes obvious quickly:<br/>"OK, we check the window--is it broken in or out?" *GM ponders, decides in would make the most sense*<br/>"Oh, yeah, you find glass on the carpet--definitely broken inward.<br/>(Of course, in a DO LARP, we might just break the window inward as part of the situation framing and leave them to notice. The abduction really starts outside of the scene of the crime, as players figure out their line of inquiry.)<br/><br/>For the method to work, the investigators HAVE to form a hypothesis which leads them to suggesting where or how they might find a clue that reinforces the hypothesis... assuming they're on the right track in the first place. A bigger risk, frankly, is that they go off on a wild goose chase, finding "evidence" that has nothing to do with the case (but which the GM thinks might plausibly exist). In such cases, blocking would HELP the players, because the GM could see where their hare-brained hypothesis is heading and cut it off with a single, "Nope, no broken windows at all."<br/><br/>Also, LARP has aspects that make a quick solution harder and, thus, make drawing out pacing easier--you gotta physically go and walk around and find the forensics expert (and a lab) or maybe you have isolation working against you (i.e. there IS NO lab or expert). But that's sort of blocking; maybe not ideal.<br/><br/>Really, the solution shouldn't be quite so clear-cut, for an entertaining mystery. No fingerprints on the knife wouldn't even be that much of a block, assuming the perp is smarter than a fifth grader. Or maybe the culprit is an NPC who isn't readily available for a quick fingerprinting round-up--LARPs play out (often) over large areas with several people; and sheer practicality could slow reaching the solution. And there's always red herrings, frame-ups, and multiple culprits to throw a wrench in the works (ex: yep, you found the killer... who has no recollection, being under Mind Control at the time... and the murders continue while he is locked away... --nods to <i>Fallen</i>--).<br/><br/>But there's ways other blocking or basic logistical challenges, particularly in more fantastic genres other than "modern." Lots of opportunity for Locked Room stuff, once you have superpowers or magic in the game. I, personally, am not a big mystery buff, so I am struggling to think quickly of ideas for a complex solution. And, hell, for that matter, someone can guess the solution in Clue on turn one, but the game seems to do fine usually.<br/><br/>The flip side is that SOME superpowers are mystery killers. Mind Reading, Domination, Divination, etc--that stuff will kick you square in the balls. (And you might note that my GLASS rules have few such abilities and warns against those it has, for this and other reasons.)<br/><br/>--I REALLY wish I could find the original thread on RPG.net where we dug into this notion for LARPs. One thing that I am now recalling was that the mystery wasn't considered the "whole story" in any sort of LARP--we were thinking more of progressive investigations that lead to an eventual confrontation of some kind (think Cthulhu stuff; or tracking down the rampaging werewolf; or figuring out who is the double-agent).--<br/><br/>Hmmm... OK, other ideas: the culprit could be briefed to actively work against the solution. Confuse the investigation or knock it off track (or, hell, kill off folks who start to get too close to the truth, if you like PVP play--which we LOVE in LARP).<br/><br/>See where I'm heading? Blocking might be the weakest tool in the GM's hands, but it works for pacing. Better, is the development of more complex webs or solutions that don't collapse under one piece of evidence. Better still, if there's a lot of reason to suspect several people, but only through a careful winnowing of facts can you nail one person with the motive and opportunity. Best of all, if the players surprise you with a cool notion and you can "drift" the actual solution to subsume their cool ideas without fucking up the continuity of other established facts (hard to do!). And orthogonal to all of this are practicalities of live play, not having a PC as the culprit at all, and restricting player resources and abilities (or location).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143787/#Comment_143787" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-13T16:01:16+00:00" title="May 13, 2008  4:01PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2008 4:04PM by John_Harper.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "We check for DNA under the fingernails."<br/>"Okay.

As a level 24 Illusionist in a previous life (to paraphrase the man), I'm quite adept at blocking, actually. My point was that the technique seems to say at first, "If it fits, give it to them." <br/>\n<br/>\nBut really it's "If it fits, give it to them if doing so doesn't ruin the pace of the game." And I think that's substantively different. It's what I set out to find out. Now that David has admitted that this is the real method, we can see that it's not so easy. And we can begin to ask "how do you decide when to block, and when not to block?" and other such questions. Or, is there another way to go that doesn't involve needing to block a lot? <br/>\n<br/>\nDavid's contention seems to be that one doesn't have to block much in actual play. Which sounds good. I'd ask why that is, however, if the players know that they can "get away" with it? Are they too into the drama to try to force a solution? Is there no competition to be the one who solves the mystery? Is it that, knowing that it's easy to win, the players try to construct something interesting instead (the principle I identify where you get a shift away from gamism by eliminating objective metrics of success)? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143940/#Comment_143940" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T08:50:39+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  8:50AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>David's contention seems to be that one doesn't have to block much in actual play.

You are basically imagining a Situation where (a) there is categorical evidence convicting someone and (b) the players will always think to seek that info and (c) the use of the info is straight-forward for implicating the Culprit.<br/><br/>What is more common is:<br/>* The Situation is intrinsically impossible or confusing or misleading (or down-right devoid of info).<br/>--ex) Locked Room; over-abundance of leads, many of which are red herrings or plants; victim washed up on riverbank after a long soaking.<br/><br/>* The players will tend to cast about (early on) and typically pursue a hypothesis which is WAY off track.<br/><br/>* The Solution (Culprit, Motive, Opportunity) actively works against being solved.<br/>--ex) Culprit is an unwitting perp OR is actively hampering the investigation OR is not readily available for questioning or DNA analysis; the event under investigation occurs when everyone has an alibi; several people have motivation to be the perp.<br/><br/>* The players want to "shine," and so can tend to hoard information until they can build up a complete Case and test it against the Solution.<br/><br/>That latter one might be the gamism hook about which you ask: suppose there are competing factions (ex: the Mob wants to find the perp to kill him; the police want to find the perp to arrest him). Now, without any "measurable" gain (other than through plot direction options) you will have groups opposing each other--perhaps even to the point of planting some evidence or red herrings or frame-ups. Or killing each other.<br/><br/>To "story it up," the GM/Organizers could offer tangible rewards for taking the most indirect path possible to the solution: for instance, each proposed clue which is successfully "found" provides some resource (or buff or whatever). Now,, the guy who one-steps through forensics "solves" the mystery but gets bupkiss.<br/><br/>In closing, don't forget that the GM/Organizers KNOW the Solution--they will have developed the Situation in such a way as to point at the Solution (or not), and they adjudicate when a Clue is valid or plausible (NOT necessarily if it's germane to the Solution!). In the end, the technique is more designed to take from the GM the burden of seeding a world with bread crumbs, and it also makes sure there's no railroad the investigators are expected to follow, from scene to scene (which mitigates frustration). Instead, the GM can focus on being "in" the investigation, rather than "above" it, waiting for Clues A, B, and C to be found and put together correctly and move the party to the next station on the rails. And, as a bonus, the GM can be creative during play, instead of front-loading all of the coolness into pre-game prep and plotting (i.e. those bread crumbs).<br/><br/>And, for LARPs, it adds a ton of other pragmatic and logistical benefits.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143943/#Comment_143943" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T08:51:14+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  8:51AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, by the way, the thread that Jason linked is really good, and it's how I knew that I wanted him to give <i>Dirty Secrets</i> a looksee to gather his input.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143956/#Comment_143956" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T10:08:08+00:00" title="May 14, 2008 10:08AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Damn, no kidding!

My post was not meant to represent "blocking" which is a concept that annoys me to begin with.<br/><br/>The stuff in my post <i>is the point of play</i>, to my way of thinking, which is what I wanted to show. "Bob Johnson did it," is not the point of play, to me. The point of play is investigating the mystery, and in so doing, playing our characters, showing who they are, what they will and won't do to solve the case, all that business.<br/><br/>So:<br/>"We check for DNA under the fingernails."<br/>"Okay. DNA profiles take two weeks."<br/><br/>Isn't a block meant to stop them from doing something or manage the pace. Far from it! It's an opportunity to <b>play</b>. Because:<br/><br/>"I grab the lab tech by the collar and haul him to the supply closet. 'Listen, fucker, there's a killer out there and he's not going to wait two weeks. You get those results to me tomorrow or the rest of the department is gonna find out about that 'special' club you like to visit on the weekends. Is that clear?' I'll use my Intimidation 2d8."<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>"Two weeks?! Screw that. The commissioner owes me a favor. I'm calling it in."<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>"We don't have that kind of time. I'm going to change the report so some of the evidence seems to match that serial case. The feds will jump all over this and we'll have our DNA processed in no time."<br/>"But they'll take the case away from us! And what if you get caught falsifying reports? I want no part of this."<br/><br/>And so on.<br/><br/>It's all material for roleplaying, character choices, adversity, conflict, and <i>the good stuff</i> (to me). A beneficial side effect is that this method also lets the players solve the mystery step by step (rather than inventing the solution themselves). But the solving isn't nearly as cool as the investigation and the choices they make along the way. The GM never blocks the players, the GM provides adversity to their investigation and tightens the screws on the situation to put pressure on the characters and see how they respond to it.<br/><br/>Blocking, heavy pacing control (to make sure they don't solve it 'too soon'), and rabbit-hole mother-may-I stuff is all Illusionism 101 like you said, Mike, and I for one am pretty tired of that kind of game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144162/#Comment_144162" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T08:34:00+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  8:34AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, I'm lost.<br/><br/>Abduction is SO far from Illusionism that I don't know where to begin. Clue Quest on the Mystery Railroad is more like Illusionism to me (i.e. "step-by-step" solution at which the players must arrive by finding all the clues and figuring out how they fit to make the solution--puzzle mystery; ick).<br/><br/>And nothing I posted speaks to how the situations can (or can't) ramp up play and challenge--I was trying to answer Mike's questions with pragmatic aspects of play and techniques lifted from mystery fiction. But use of technique A, B, or C is utterly orthogonal to how that technique may or may not lead to 'RightGoodFun' play--you set up an utterly false dichotomy.<br/><br/>For example, the very-common technique of character isolation isn't blocking nor Illusionism--it's a limitation (recall that "limitations foster creativity"); it takes away the crutch of calling The Pros From Dover and knocking it out before tea).<br/>Developing a complex solution isn't railroading--it's a way for the player's to more-fully engage creatively (and collaboratively--like the thread title?) rather than just asking "Got prints on the knife? Got prints in the database? Cool, we're done before lunch!" And FAR better (in my mind) than, "OK, go find your clues. They're all somewhere in the State Park, I promise!" I don't go to Easter Eggs hunts on Easter (maybe I'm weird). And then, "WOW, you got them all? OK, solve the mystery! I'll be sleeping in my cabin while you scratch your heads for the next five hours...".<br/><br/>But I guess I'm totally lost. I had no idea I was in the "railroad the players, take away their opportunities to shine, make the players violate the Czege Principle" camp, all of a sudden.<br/><br/>(Or maybe I am not the one to who you're speaking, John--proving once again that the Quote function is invaluable for providing context in text-only exchanges?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144168/#Comment_144168" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T08:46:28+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  8:46AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steve Dempsey suggests a <a href="http://www.pelgranepress.com/seepagexx/December2007-Steve.html" rel="nofollow">a way this can be done</a> using GUMSHOE, and some actual play is <a href="http://yog-sothoth.com/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=1254" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

The key is that for each player there is one personal mystery, which all the other players build up. For that player (and his/her character), they get the full Reveal, even while they're creating mystery for the other characters. And everyone does this at once.<br/><br/>In that game, you participate in creating mysteries for others even as you yourself fight through your own (which is created by all the others). There is also an "overarching mystery" in all the bits that are created by the way the system and players' narrations tie together.<br/><br/>The model has worked really well so far in all playtests, but, alas, I've never had a chance to play the game for a long enough time to see it to any sort of reasonable endpoint--usually only the tip of the iceberg was revealed in play before we had to quit. In particular, I've never played long enough (the longest playtest was maybe 2-3 hours) to reveal the big mystery no one is privy to. I can't honestly say whether it would work out or not.<br/><br/>The short version: I think there are other methods out there that are worth exploring! And having players create and reveal mysteries for each other (like a GM does) could work quite well. For instance, imagine a system where you, as a player, can flag something you want to discover, and then another player steps up to take the responsibility for seeding more clues, and another for the big reveal... I'm sure there are games out there now that use this (I just haven't played them).
