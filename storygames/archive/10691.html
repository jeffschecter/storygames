I just had a thought that if you played GURPS Supers, put the PCs in competition, and gave everyone the ability to steal each other's powers, awesomeness might ensue.  You'd get some fun Risk-style temporary coalitions against front-runners and so on (I know that's not in Risk's rules, but I can't be the only one who plays that way, right?).<br/><br/>Power-stealing would have to be balanced right, but seeing as how GURPS has balanced-enough point values for everything, I don't think it'd take too much genius to work out.<br/><br/>You would, of course, have to pay for your method of power-stealing... touch would cost more than dissection... maybe the theft would have to be somehow related to another power you started with...<br/><br/>I'm not sure whether, as an RPG, this would be fun strictly as "he with all the powers at the end wins", or whether there'd need to be some further arena for the competition.  Maybe it could just be assumed that with all the powers you can then proceed to inflict your will upon humanity, and you could narrate that as epilogue.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237146/#Comment_237146" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-13T07:34:43+00:00" title="October 13, 2009  7:34AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This might actually merge well with the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=10684&amp;page=1#Item_6" rel="nofollow">goblin market thread</a>, y'know.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
