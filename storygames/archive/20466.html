(This is largely how NPCs work anyway, this approach would just lampshade that convention.) So if you choose Fighter as your class, well, there may be other warriors in the world, but you're <b>The Fighter</b>, and there can be no others.<br/><br/>What's particularly interesting to consider is that, in this "young world" setting, most of the classes simply <i>don't exist yet</i>. Only the ones the players choose have actually been instantiated.<br/><br/>I also wrote up some Sex Moves for 5E classes, which goes along with this...<br/><br/>Anyhoo, what do you all think would make for interesting primary conflicts in such a setting and using 5E's mechanics?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449914/#Comment_449914" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-06T06:05:14+00:00" title="December  6, 2015  6:05AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe I'm not familiar enough with D&amp;D5's classes, but how do you see this changing anything in play?<br/><br/>With the case of magic or unusual powers, it seems clear enough.

In Apocalypse World fashion...there are many warriors, and they may call themselves fighters, but there is only one person who is The Fighter, there are many burglars and cutpurses and scoundrels, but only one person who is The Thief. (I was almost 100% positive that there was a verbatim quote to this effect in Dungeon World, but I can't place it.)<br/><br/>It's an interesting conceit of the game, but I like the fact that it acknowledges that the only characters who really "level up" and get super things are the PCs, which avoids wild worldbuilding implications such as those you find in D&amp;D, where you've got Elminster around the corner who knows way more spells than you ever will. Other characters will often be powerful and important, but only the PCs have such immense potential. It's a way of making them "chosen ones" without the hard-coded "The One" approach.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449928/#Comment_449928" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-07T17:56:35+00:00" title="December  7, 2015  5:56PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>It's an interesting conceit of the game, but I like the fact that it acknowledges that the only characters who really "level up" and get super things are the PCs, which avoids wild worldbuilding implications such as those you find in D&amp;D, where you've got Elminster around the corner who knows way more spells than you ever will. </blockquote>\nOh, I see.

It's simply a choice about setting, and it should add less complexity and design work (mainly making classes more vague and generic) than it removes, because history and many traditional D&amp;D complications like powerful NPCs or special magic do not exist yet in a "young world"; whole ecosystems and civilizations require less effort than, say, picking Elminster's magical items.<br/><br/>On the other hand, further hacking to get appropriate rules for world creation seems in order.

Alternatively you can state "And that's why that place got it's name, the cave of X" (after whoever got killed there) or things like "That's why there's a boulder with the shape of a grieving woman that still amazes the travelers that go that far into the forest"<br/><br/>Oh, of course, players could get to name things in the map whenever they got there, since they would be the first ones there ever!

That might be a perfectly valid option but I can't comment on what I don't know. <br/><br/>To me, it just seems like OP has a really cool idea for a fantasy world and campaign they'd like to explore, but trying to go about it in a more difficult way than has to be. Once again, nothing wrong with that approach, but hacking a hammer into a screwdriver when you can just use a screwdriver seems a little redundant, yeah?<br/><br/>Dungeon World is a game already designed to have applied Vincent Baker's AW design objectives into D&amp;D. <br/><br/>-Player Characters are unique and the only ones in the world with that set of abilities.<br/>-Players have an in-game ability to create fictional fact about the world and establish setting. (Spout Lore move).<br/>-Bonds as a form of Sex Moves between characters.<br/><br/>DW also takes a very novel approach to the longstanding issue of campaign conflicts through its use of Fronts. The most poignant conflicts I'd like to see in a "fresh" world as OP's would be the Players asserting themselves in either newly formed or established communities and the ramifications of choices they make. (EX: do they promote industry causing a gigantic industrial boom on this side of the world spurring war for resources and poverty? Do help discover magic crystals in the far hills? Do they mine the magic creating an abundance of it? Is it stockpiled by the rich? etc).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449949/#Comment_449949" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-10T15:46:58+00:00" title="December 10, 2015  3:46PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know it's the usual custom in the forum and we've already discussed that saying to OPs "try this game instead" isn't bad netiquette at all, but I'd really like to see more ideas for ways to use D&amp;D to get what Deliverator wants.

My home-brewed XP system for 5th is basically just a rip-off of that. But something about 2d6+mods has gotten a little ho-hum for me after so much of it.<br/><br/>Also, since the idea presented here is purely a narrative conceit, you could pretty much use it in any game with distinct classes, or at least many such games. (It'd be... interesting... in EarthDawn, where PCs are assumed to have access to higher-level members of their classes to train them.)                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SeleneTan" title="SeleneTan"><img alt="SeleneTan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/264/nRW74G3J2K4XC.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SeleneTan">SeleneTan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450075/#Comment_450075" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-17T00:36:41+00:00" title="December 17, 2015 12:36AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For 5e, you could let players spend their Inspiration in a scene to describe its legacy in the world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450079/#Comment_450079" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-17T06:30:47+00:00" title="December 17, 2015  6:30AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt;&gt;there should be, for example, some mechanic to "create a precedent" when the characters do something for the first time ever.&lt;&lt;<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;For that part, right after the scene where the party did something new in the world, I would close the scene with something like "And that's the tale of how X people (the NPCs or even monsters in the vicinity) do Y (a reaction to whatever the party did) until this very day". Alternatively you can state "And that's why that place got it's name, the cave of X" (after whoever got killed there) or things like "That's why there's a boulder with the shape of a grieving woman that still amazes the travelers that go that far into the forest"<br/>&lt;&lt;<br/><br/>BTW, those two things, along with SeleneTan's comment, are my favorite ideas from this thread. I'm kind of imagining just keeping track of what facts we establish on a big piece of chart paper on the wall, and seeing what kind of wacky setting emerges.<br/><br/>But I do like the idea of limiting those setting-defining moments to things that PCs spend Insp on. The way I run 5E, Insp flows fairly liberally, so it's not a huge constraint, but it means we don't have to be adding setting details with every skill roll.<br/><br/>Here's a sketch of an idea for the setting:<br/><br/>So you have your Good Gods and your Bad Gods, right? (Really just Team A and Team B, because I dislike alignment.) And after they create the world, they start squabbling, and their battles threaten to destroy this new creation before anything really interesting can happen with it, like diverse ecosystems, different forms of government, or Dwarven cocktail parties. And Team C (the "neutral" gods) are like, "Uh uh. Nope. Go stand in your corners, Teams A and B. You can still create creatures in the world, but all the intelligent ones have to have free will. And you yourselves may never enter its planar sphere."<br/><br/>So the PCs are the "good" team's scions. They don't get missions from Mom and Dad so much as problems that need solving.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
