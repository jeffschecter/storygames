Even more simplified system.<br/>2. Even less dramatic setting.<br/><br/>1. Little Fears has a neat dice system and interesting Belief mechanics. Monster creation also works pretty well.<br/>However, I'd like to simplify it even more. I can think of a lot of things ranging from Fate Accelerated, Monster of the Week (AW) hack to Dread.<br/><br/>I've actually built a Fate Accelerated (FAE) conversion:<br/><i>- Fate Points for belief &amp; monster fear token<br/>- standard FAE approaches (on skill level of children)<br/>- Fight: Attack (Damage: Stress, Physical Consequences)<br/>- Grab/Chase:  Create Advantage<br/>- Scare: Attack (Damage: Stress, Mental Consequences)<br/>- Spirit Draining: Attack (Damage: Stress, Spiritual Consequences)</i><br/><br/>Still, I would like to keep it even more light and story-focused, more rewarding for GM?<br/><br/><br/>2. Even though the Nightmare Edition made it toned down compared to the original version, the Little Fears setting is still too powerless and terrifying to me esp. for playing one-shots.<br/><br/>I was thinking of playing it like a Dream World. A Shaman has taught a group of children dream walking. At night, when sleeping, they wander through a shared dream world and set out for missions. When they die in the dream, they simply wake-up and get to eat their pancakes &amp; cereal for breakfast.<br/><br/>What do you think?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447757/#Comment_447757" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-08T09:13:26+00:00" title="August  8, 2015  9:13AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting.

I find that too harsh for my personal taste (even though I also like dramatic freeform games with potential bleed).<br/>Nightmare Edition (2nd) doesn't feel like "Halloween fantasy monster hunting" since the kids are still immersed into a world of overwhelming monsters, just slightly less disturbing.<br/><br/>Of course, just using 1st edition as <i>system</i> is another thing. But I had the impression that 2nd edition was more well balanced.<br/><br/>I understood various questions during character creation including negative traits simply as inspiration for the GM to exploit.<br/><br/>Anyway, at the moment I'm leaning towards trying Little Fears with Dread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447776/#Comment_447776" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-09T00:27:43+00:00" title="August  9, 2015 12:27AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm ignorant but intrigued... what is the setting of Little Fears, and how does the 2nd edition differ from the 1st? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>Above all, how is it "more disturbing"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447778/#Comment_447778" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-09T04:48:31+00:00" title="August  9, 2015  4:48AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It mixes supernatural monsters with adults that hurt the kids. <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447832/#Comment_447832" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-10T07:11:18+00:00" title="August 10, 2015  7:11AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2015 7:12AM by BeePeeGee.">edited August 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hasimir, the 1st edition was a very bold immersion into the world of childhood nightmares. It created this sense of childhood powerlessness surprisingly well and won some awards, I think. Yet, it was also quite disturbing because it included quite traumatizing child experiences. For a lot of people (including me), this made the game too hard to play with a regular RPG group.<br/>The 2nd edition (Nightmare edition) substantially toned down the disturbing elements (and polished the mechanics). For me, this became a more realistic game for a usual RPG crowd. Of course, at the same time, the setting lost some of its "oh my God, this is terrifyingly real" sensation which attracted a lot of people in the first place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
