                    Just recently I was listening to the 2d6 Feet in a Random Direction podcast and one of the hosts brought up a concept he called "backstorying" to flesh out characters in one-shots.  As I was listening to this, I thought it would be a great way to develop NPCs.  The thing I'm concerned about is having to create dozens and dozens of NPC personalities and ties to each other and the PCs.  Not that I'm incapable of doing so or that I think there's no joy in populating a game world, it's that if I create five dozen NPCs, they're all going to start sharing the same characteristics.  There's hundreds of people that the PCs meet, but it's the same twenty personalities with different face paint.  So I'm going to use the backstorying technique to flesh out the NPCs.  <br/><br/>Here's what it is.  I'll create a name and a general description for an NPC, then ask the players questions to flesh them out. <br/><br/>I'd say something like "Carryl, sitting across  from you is Emma Watts, a tall, darkskinned woman with scarf that depicts a British flag around her neck.  You've had a few conversations with her in passing with her at work over the past few months.  What have they been about?"<br/><br/>Then Carryl's player would respond with something about Emma's research with Dr. Lundis, the NPC that Carryl used to work for.  Then I'd ask Richard "and how does Emma feel about Carryl?"  He might respond "Emma is jealous of Carryl and Carryl's work."  Then I'd ask Brian what dark secret Emma hasn't told Carryl.  Brian tells me that Emma and Lundis had a drunken one-night stand that's soured their working relationship.<br/><br/>BAM.  Little GM prep and a whole lot of detail from the players that sheds a light on two of the PC's main NPCs.  It's totally cool and gets the players involved a lot more in a game that has a major GM/player divide.<br/><br/>Chris is one of the hosts of that podcast; perhaps he can explain the backstorying a bit  further.                </div>

                            Well, I think it's more than just a relationship map, it's a way for the GM to generate no-prep or low-prep NPCs for any role-playing game.  From what I've read about the relationship map -- or rather, what I've gathered from the volumes of material written on relationship maps -- they seem to be tools to codify ties between existing characters in a game.  I might be wrong about that; it was very difficult to find a definition of the relationship map reading various message board threads discussing relationship maps.  Everyone was discussing tangential aspects of the topic but never the topic itself.  I felt like a blind man attempting to describe an elephant.<br/><br/>Why am I doing all the asking?  My gaming history (and the gaming history of all the players) has been of the great divide:  the GM does all the game prep including creating all the NPCs and the adventure, the players show up and interact with the GM's plot through dice rolls, dialogue trees, and what location they're in.  Up until a few months ago, the only bit of player-driven world empowerment that was in my games was my old fence in an alleyway example.  (It goes like this.  <i>If I, the GM, say there's a fence at the end of the alley, you, the player, can say that you're looking through the chain link fence.  You wouldn't be able to pry a board off the fence because you established it's a chain link fence.  Also, you could say that you're picking up a brick in the alley because it would be reasonable that a brick might be in an alley. </i>)  Since participating in this site, reading The Forge, and listening to various podcasts, I've become all about the player empowerment.  GM-less RPGs were some mythical beast to me a year ago.  I would not have imagined that a games like PTA, where players create the scenes of the game; The Shab-al-Hiri Roach, where there is no GM; or Lacuna, where the GM doesn't even roll dice, could exist.  This past year has sparked more good ideas about game play than I've had in my prior two decades of gaming.<br/><br/>So short answer:  Why am I doing all the asking?  I never thought it would be possible for the players to ask the questions about the relationships between characters.  I'm very certain that the players would never come up with questions if they weren't prompted by me, either.                        </div>

                            Howdy Thomas and All,<br/><br/>It looks like Chris wasn't able to stop by (owing to his laptop being heisted, a pox on the thief), so I'll try to field it, mainly because I'm the <i>other</i> co-host of <a href="http://www.2d6feet.com" rel="nofollow">2d6 Feet in a Random Direction</a>.  I guess that makes Backstory my mess.  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>To jump right in with your question, I've actually done some <i>backstorying</i> of NPCs. (Wow - it's a noun and verb.  Awesome.). Over the last handful of seasons, I have been doing general backstorying from time to time, under the guise of a "catch-up".  Same types of examples as you're quoting, Thomas. For NPCs in session play, less so - although, generally speaking, players have to come up with their own contacts.<br/><br/>I think at the core, it involves getting your players used to answering questions from you about the world, the npcs, and their characters. I've had good luck with it in campaigns thus far; the convention and demo game results have been great. I also like that it's transportable, and is system agnostic.<br/><br/>Oh yea, and thanks for listening!<br/><br/>Brian                        </div>

                            The approach I use is one I first saw used by a local GM: he calls it the 3x3 or, in the expanded version, the 3x5.  It consists of asking players to write up three entries for three out of the five following topics (3x3).  You can offer extra credit, such as a few additional character creation points, an extra trait or edge, extra luck points, whatever is applicable to the system.  To earn a few more points, the players can opt to write up three entries for <b>each</b> of the five topics (3x5).<br/>
<br/>
* Friends/Allies<br/>
* Contacts<br/>
* Enemies<br/>
* Locations<br/>
* Organizations<br/>
<br/>
I really like it; it yields a lot of connections to each player character and a lot of plots to draw from when inspiration is flagging.  No more "My character is a loner" -- you can always pick from the enemies, locations, etc.                        </div>

I think the interesting thing - and most valuable for me - with the Backstorying technique is the manner in which the relationship map is completed.  I enjoy the interactivity, the question / answer style.  It's also very immediate.<br><br>Given I also use it at the start of a one-off, con game, etc., I find the player bonding and buy-in work out really well to take a complete group of strangers (often) and get them to know their characters, relationships, and build comraderie in a very short amount of time.  In that aspect, I'm using the technique for more team building .                        </br></br></div>
