<p>I'm in the process of re-reading a lot of the stuff about reaching the mainstream with RPGs.  While I've been doing so, I see an awful lot of folks saying that they still don't feel comfortable introducing RPGs to people outside the hobby.  The most common reasons seem to be either the complexity of the rules or some discomfort with the 'geekyness' of it.  At the same time I see plenty of folks banging their drum about making games for mainstream folks, with the implication that such games don't yet exist.</p>
<p>But don't they?</p>
<p>I see a whole potential holiday shopping list of non-geeky &amp; non-complex RPGs out there.  The <em>Shab-al-Hiri Roach</em>.  Totally not complex.  I'd play it with my mom.  Right after taking "Murub" out of the deck.  How about PTA and <em>The Mountain Witch</em>?  They take up lots of time, but they're not complex.  The arcane knowlege they require from their players is television and samaurai films, respectively.  Those aren't mainstream?  There are a dozen other games out there that I've heard of, have this gut feeling that they're just as close to mainstream, but just haven't played or read them yet.</p>
<p>If these games really aren't mainstream potential, then what is it that you see in them that isn't mainstream?</p>

                            Eric, I think these games are a good start. But the indie scene creating these is small. I think the push to create more is a very good thing. <br/>
<br/>
Also, as a non-gamer, I find that game-designers usually think their games are more easily played by newbies than they really are. Just from my experience at conventions. So, based on my own experiences, I'd say that game designers should always be evaluating how easy it really is for someone new to pick up their game and play. Someone without years of actual play history.                        </div>

<p><strong><em>I find that game-designers usually think their games are more easily played by newbies than they really are.</em></strong></p>
<p>I totally agree.  In fact, a while back I had this same discussion with someone else over <em>Trollbabe</em>.  I felt that it was missing vital instructions while they disagreed.</p>
<p>Sure, there's plenty of room still for improvement.  Become 'more mainstream' if you will.  But my point is that there are plenty of games that are already easy for an experienced gamer to introduce to a non-gamer.  Those are the game I wanna point at and talk about.  Have you played the Roach, or Mountain Witch, or even Trollbabe?  Their mechanisms are really quite easy.  Granted, I can't explain them as quickly as I can explain, say, Treehouse, but I can explain them just as easily as Risk or Settlers of Catan.</p>

                            In a traditional RPG the GM does the most work, making it easier for all the other players.  This makes it a lot easier for <b>new</b> players.  In a game where the duties of the traditional GM are shared amongst the group -- so is the work.

For some reason they're socially acceptable. How did that happen? How did they get legitimacy? Did they evolve from something else? Seems to me that a bunch of you designers should get together and craft something to compete with those games, because I've played one or two and they were lame as hell.                        </div>

I agree 100%.  The fact that some exist, doesn't mean that enough exist.  I would add <i>Breaking the Ice</i> and <i>InSpectres</i> to the list of things that work well with new people.<br/><br/>There are very few games which can be (1) played in under 2 hours, and (2) explained on an index card, (3) understood as a clearly good time by non-gamers.  And the ones that do exist, are an infinitesimally small part of the market.  (Does anyone have sales figures for the games mentioned so far?)<br/><br/>Last Friday, Jon and I got together and our girlfriends started talking about gaming (neither of them game).  And the tone they adopted was, like, frustrated bemusement.  "I don't get the whole thing with points, and levels, and stuff."  "I don't get why it goes on for so long."  "Why is everything so complicated?"  "I like board games a lot, we play them all the time, but somehow role-playing games . . . I don't know . . .  I'm glad you boys like them, but . . . "<br/><br/>I tried explaining about <i>Primetime Adventures</i>, where it's really just three things written down, and then you play War to determine who says things.  And they were like, "Oh... Yeah, I wish more of them were like that."<br/><br/>It was a fun night for many reasons, but it's not every day you get the candid opinions from non-gamers about what's off-putting about games (especially on top of these recent threads)!                        </div>

Eric,<br/><br/>I really don't agree. Shab al-Hiri Roach asks you to do things like incorporate NPCs into the narration. For someone not used to roleplaying games, I think that's deceptively complex. Not that they <i>can't</i> do it: just that they don't quite understand what they're meant to do and decide to play Scrabble instead.<br/><br/>I don't know PTA or The Mountain Witch. But take another simple game such as, say, Breaking The Ice. Again, it's simple to roleplayers, but deceptively complex. Things like "give a die to reward good narration" and "narrate something that puts you at a disadvantage" are deceptively difficult for non-roleplayers: when I tried it with my girlfriend, this took a fair amount of coaching and, even afterwards, she wasn't very comfortable. We haven't played Breaking The Ice again. We've played Scrabble lots of times.<br/><br/>So, yes, I think we've got a real  unsolved problem: that most roleplaying games are difficult for outsiders to understand.<br/><br/>In murder mystery games, on the other hand, it's usually very clear what everyone's expected to do (although I agree with Jeff that many are bad). I think they're an excellent model for making our games more accessible.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

<p>James,</p>
<p>So, there <em>are</em> games, RPGs, in your repertoire that you can casually introduce to mainstreamers, right?  That right there is my underlining point.  The desire for more?  Fine.  But there's a lot of noise here right now (not pointing any fingers) implying that there's nothing mainstream out there.  And I think it's BS.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Also, I want to add another issue.  There's similarly a lot of noise about how things <em>should be</em> or what game designers <em>should design</em>.  It's an awful lot of <em>wish in one hand and shit in the other</em>.  I'd be so happy if <em>"I want"</em> was replaced with <em>"I'm making this happen and I could use some help."</em>.  That would be awesome.</p>

<p>Graham,</p>
<p>Well, what's the difference between the simple RPGs and the murder mystery boxes?  <em>Making stuff up.</em>  That's what.  And I think your examples about what your girlfriend found difficult underline that.  "Narrate something that puts you at a disadvantage" is not a complex rule.  It's just unfamiliar territory.  Creative freedom isn't complex.  It's just not common.</p>
<p>Edit:  Hey Graham.  While I totally disagree with you about the complexity/difficulty of those rules, you totally got my head whirring about something.  <em>Guidance</em>.  What I was suddenly imaginging was this;  What if you were in the middle of a non-RPG, say Settlers of Catan.  And, out of nowhere you asked your girlfriend "Gee, I wonder why the settlers would build a city on the edge of the desert?", I'm imagining she could come up with some creative response.</p>
<p>But!  The thing that all RPGs I know of assume is that the players are all used to big creative freedoms, and therefore have big creative muscles.  Therefore the RPGs throw <em>wide</em> guiderails in there.  That's what "narrate a disadvantage" is, isn't it?  It's a really really wide guiderail.  So, I wonder how it would work out if one were to design a game specificially for getting peoples' creative feet wet.  Something with more restrictive and comfortable guiderails.  I'm not sure what it would look like, but that's what hit me while I was shaving.</p>

If you're not implying that someone should immdediately drop their designs for a 700 page manual on lightsaber vs. katana fights to make you a game to play with your mom, then awesome.  I've got no beef with you.</p>
<p>Edited to add:  I'd like to point out that if one happens to place their harmless consumer preferences into a thread that's full of other implications about what designers should be doing, then it's pretty easy to accidentally take on the same implications.</p>

                            I personally feel that if you were to make a RPG into something that was really mainstream it would no longer be a RPG. I think that the task is largely impossible. I think you can only make games "more accessible to the mainstream" not "completely accessible." And to that extent, yes, we already have that. The "urge" to have such games isn't that we don't, I don't think, but that most are not that way. So any stigma associated with the hobby will remain until most are more accessible.<br/>
<br/>
That's the theory.<br/>
<br/>
I personally have never understood why we want the mainstream in anyhow, however. Unless, perhaps, people are looking to make more money doing this stuff. I've got plenty of players.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose that might surprise people that I feel that way, but that's probably because my participation in recent threads has very strongly mischaracterized my arguments. I've only said that the impetus to move to the mainstream is not caused by some self-loathing or fear. My argument against mainstreaming is not based on that, I think it's a rational idea in general. My argument is that it's impossible, largely, and that the goal may not have much value.<br/>
<br/>
I do not want to play RPGs with my family or my coworkers. They're not friends of mine in the sense of social peers that I want to socialize with. I think that's who people should want to play RPGs with. Again, I have more players than I know what to do with already.<br/>
<br/>
Again, this has long been my opinion, and I can cite threads where I've said this, if need be.<br/>

This is sort of off-topic for this thread, but it's a small thought, so I'm not sure it deserves its own thread...but I've read about this gateway game concept to get more people into role-playing, and I just don't buy into the theory that some game will make non-gamers want to get into hard-core role-playing. It may, but I'd love to hear from anyone where this actually happened. <br><br>Anyway, my suggestion would be to dump the gateway concept and create causal role-playing games for the mainstream for their own sake and not as a gateway game.<br><br>On topic: I had a similar experience playing Breaking the Ice with my girlfriend as Graham had. It's a simple game, but it is very demanding. I don't think very many people would be able to figure it out without prior gaming experience.<br><br>InSpectres Start-Up has worked very well for me. Heck, my mom played, but on the second run we used the full rules, and they lost interest very quickly while creating the business, characters in the beginning of the game. Too much set-up time.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Personally, I think the one thing that makes a gateway game good is the one thing that's very hard for Indie designers to incorporate:<br><br>A big license.<br><br>The best gateway game ever was D6 Star Wars.

                            Here's my thoughts on this.  It largely depends on what we mean by "mainstream."  I think the largest untapped potential for bringing people into the RPG hobby is people who already love to play games but don't play RPGs.  I think we have already have games that are accessable and would be fun for these people.  I would happly play Shooting The Moon, PtA or even My Life with Master with anyone who would already jump on board for a game of Clue or Monopoly.<br/><br/>What I don't think we have is game TEXTS that make RPGs accessable to the same people without an "in the know" leader.  I don't think someone who is familiar with family night boardgaming can pick up My Life with Master or even PtA and really know what to DO.  This is because we still have not developed a language for the procedures of play.  Texts often start with elaborate descriptions of setting or characters with out saying what function these things serve on a game play level.  Texts often describe how to resolve conflict without specifing the scope or purpose of conflicts or how to set one up or recognize its ending.<br/><br/>Now as far as roping the rest of the world I find that the situation first model works best.  When talking to absotutely non-game savy people about RPGs I usually pick Dogs in the Vineyard or My Life with Master to discuss because they have strong upfront easily relatable situations.  Interestingly enough I usually get a, "I'd like to try that sometime...." response in kind a of an understanded musing tone.  Back in the day when I would simply try to describe D&amp;D, I'd usually get a "Hmmmm... interesting" response in a kind of hesitant tone.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>

Amen.  Converting casual gamers into hardcore is ass-backwards.

Amen again.  Strongly constrained choices can be much easier than free narration.<br/><br/>Eric, I think my real concern with most existing games that might be capable of casual play is they demand too much work on the part of the person introducing the game to make them really accessible.  They're not meant to be picked up and run by a group of casual gamers or even for a hardcore gamer to introduce and play with casual gamers.  They're meant for a group of hardcore gamers to pick up and play in casual style, if that makes any sense.  If you haven't roleplayed all that much before, these games aren't going to make a lot of sense to you.  You need a hardcore roleplayer who's played the game before to walk you through it and the text doesn't give the explainer a whole lot of help in that regard.  There are no cheatsheets, there are no Quickstart Rules, there are no other tools that make explaining the game easier.<br/><br/>Edit: Cross-posted with Jesse, who hit many of the same points.                        </div>

                            I'm with Jesse. The one thing the murder mystery box games really had that bears on this conversation is the no-need-for-an-experienced-guide factor.<br/><br/>And as designers it's really hard for us to examine our games through that lens. I never thought My Life with Master could be played by folks utterly without gaming experience. The text speaks too directly to various gaming assumptions.

                            While I agree that D&amp;D is easier for some people than PTA, I'd say that the opposite is true, too. That for some PTA is easier. Basically I don't think that anybody thinks that there's really an advantage to one sort of play or another in terms of accessibility.<br/>
<br/>
It's sometimes falsely claimed that the sorts of games that people are touting as being more mainstream are so because they focus on narration. But that's simply not the case. If you asked Matt why PTA is more accessible than D&amp;D for some people, I'm sure he'd tell you it's because there are no elves in PTA. Rather that everyone is familiar with ensemble TV, and so has a common frame of reference for the material. That, if anything, is PTA's outreach to the mainstream.<br/>
<br/>
I think there's some notion that people producing games said to support narrativism are saying that narrativism is more approachable than other forms. First, they aren't saying this that I can see (in fact, the opposite argument is usually bandied about that Gamism is far more accessible, as it's what people think of Games as being). Second, narrativism isn't about narration (then it'd be narrarionism). But, in fact, about making decisions. Some narrativism supporting games have very little in the way of narration, perhaps even less than D&amp;D.<br/>
<br/>
So... I'm not sure what the overall point is here.<br/>

<p>Eric,</p>

<p>But! The thing that all RPGs I know of assume is that the players are all used to big creative freedoms, and therefore have big creative muscles. Therefore the RPGs throw wide guiderails in there. That's what "narrate a disadvantage" is, isn't it? It's a really really wide guiderail. So, I wonder how it would work out if one were to design a game specificially for getting peoples' creative feet wet. Something with more restrictive and comfortable guiderails. I'm not sure what it would look like, but that's what hit me while I was shaving.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I'm finding that, out in the wilderness of design, we're actually seeing a lot of this. I'l use Jonathan's design <em>Waiting for the Queen/Tea at Midnight</em> as an example 'cause I'm familiar with it, but this is everywhere - the Roach has pretty strong guidance, a few of my unfinished designs do as well, and no doubt these are only a few out of many.</p>
<p>So, in Waiting/Tea, you're provided with characters, a short intro to the color of each character, a situation, and a pretty much comprehensive accounting of the physical events that will transpire. Given all this data, the players insert dialogue and emotional content. It's pretty liberating.</p>

                            Capes is not what I'd consider an easy game, though, it both the narration-passing AND a highly strategic/tactical set of decisions so that unless you get people who are good at both they're just not going to grasp it.  It's highly quirky and has a significant learning curve. Even Capes Lite is pretty hard (although admittedly it Completely Wins by having the most explicit and clear set of 'first do this, then do this' instructions in a LONG time.)<br/><br/>MURPG would be my supers intro game of choice, although Mutants and Masterminds with pregens is just as good. (Traditional supers games suffer a great deal from the joy-of-making-characters mini-game, which is not real easy to get enthused about unless you've actually played.)<br/><br/>And I don't know about "PTA doesn't have elves" as a reason it is mainstream. I've talked it up to people who don't game and they said "Oh, so you could do something like a Lord of the Rings type show?" Thinking about the movies. And naturally I said yes, yes they could. Episodic TV is what's fuelling PTA's coolness, not necessarily because they'd be turned off by fantastical content and it doesn't have any.                        </div>

I'd concur with the first part.  Over the years, I've played D&amp;D, Toon, Paranoia, Truth &amp; Justice and other RPGs with non-gamers.  As a specific example, my mother-in-law played in a bit of my BRP-based Vinland campaign.  <br/><br/>Apropos of the season, I'd disagree with the second part.  Distribution can work through the existing network.  A game could spread <i>much</i> more quickly if I could simply give it as a Christmas present to my nephews -- rather than having to get them join in a live game for one or several sessions to show them how it works.  This is the huge advantage that something like the boardgame Carcassone has.                        </div>

I'm certainly not going to disagree with this. I'm sure distribution of the kind that is needed if far harder for an indie company than others. But isn't this putting the chicken before the egg? If you can design the game, why not do it? Make sure that it's fun and it works, and then figure out how to get it into a distribution channel that lands it on a table at Barnes &amp; Noble for the holiday season right next to games like Apples to Apples, Cranium and Puerto Rico. When I was a kid, I bought all my role-playing games at Target, so it's not like the potential hasn't been there in the past. And how will it ever be known if this new category of games will work without trying it. Besides, I still think there is a market among gamers for this type of game -- playing with the family, giving gifts, and lending as Jonathan suggests.<br/><br/>Just a thought.<br/><br/>edit: Cross posted with John.                        </div>

                            I should add <i>Contenders</i> into the mix.<br/>
I reckon it ticks all the mainstream boxes: real world setting, simple mechanics, short rules, no GM, requires only a deck of standard playing cards, has a goal, easy to grasp reward mechanic, can be played out in a single evening.<br/>
<br/>
Mind you, Ron explains all this much better here <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21003.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21003.0</a>.<br/>

Oh and <i>Piledrivers and Powerbombs</i> too. I've played both these games with non-roleplayers and they went down a treat.<br/>

There's MUCH less gamer talk in there now. However, on the flip side, the text is longer to explain things more carefully. The new edition will weigh in at 100 pages, more or less. Also, Contenders -- yes!                        </div>

                            Jason, <i>have </i>you actually pulled out Contenders at a party? I'd be quite embarrassed to pull a roleplaying game out at a party. We played <i>Taboo</i>, last week, last after an early Christmas dinner. I couldn't have pulled out Paranoia (or Dogs or something else) and asked if people fancied a game.<br><br>Eric, I'm interested by what you say about guiderails. I agree: I think that, often, non-roleplayers are more comfortable with tightly constrained narration. <br><br>But, having said that, I'm interested in the discussion on Bacchanal. Bacchanal has very wide-ranging narration (look at the dice in your glass and narrate what they inspire you to narrate). But there's something very simple about it. I think Bacchanal's the best contender for a game to bring out at a party. Apart, of course, from the subject matter. Well, it depends on the party, of course.<br><br>Graham                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Hi!<br/>
  I have thoughts on this:<br/>
1) I think we have to be realistic about what is main stream (Risk and Host a Murder are not THAT mainstream for instance - We need to think more like Monopoly, trivial pursuit, you know?)<br/>
2) I don't think a major license is required (certainly many popular licenses have been made into an RPG and none of them have become wildly popular)<br/>
3) I do think the setting/backdrop/etc. Has to be accessible to a wider audience<br/>
4) I do think its important not to underestimate our audience. The mainstream demographic has most likely played Chess, Scrabble or monopoly)<br/>
5) Finally, I think the game has to avoid the common pitfalls of RPGs. Like too wide or narrow narration or scene framing demands.<br/>
  My guess is PTA would be a good example of an existing game that would fit the bill. What I think might help would be a col combo of Toon and TSoY!<br/>

<p>I think you're dead on about being realistic with regards to what is really mainstream, Dave. And yeah, not only is a major license not required, I think it hasn't actually worked that well in the past. However, if we redefine our goal as "bring in people who aren't roleplayers right now," instead of some vague "mainstream", I think a tiny number of new people came into the hobby each time there was a major license. I know one girl who never roleplayed, but who bought the Sailor Moon RPG because of her interest in Sailor Moon. (But on the other hand, did she ever play it? I don't think so, but she may have, after I lost touch with her.)</p>
<p>And a tiny number of people joined each time a particular genre or setting was adapted to RPGs for the first time (superheroes, horror... what's the next genre to get a good adaptation?)</p>

                            I brought Primetime Adventures home with me for the holidays. To pull out if time allows.<br/>
<br/>
Now, keep in mind we've got little nieces and nephews and tons of toys... so I'll probably be spending the day helping little hands build Lego Block X-Wing and B-Wing fighters.... But I did bring the game, and will pull it out if there a moment of, "Gee, what should we do?"<br/>

<p>I should first point out that I see a gaping void between "describe your sword", "open the door", and things like Waiting/Tea, where your input is actually <em>important</em> because it constrains and affects what comes after.</p>
<p>Colin, in my experience people are generally rather smart and creative. People like creative authority. They even tend to assume authorities they don't actually have - I've had countless experiences with OUAT where new players misunderstand the rules in ways that give them excessive ability to interrupt, or abilities to edit what's come before, and so on. No one ever misunderstands the game in ways that give them <em>less</em> authority.</p>
<p>My hypothesis is that this is because authority in OUAT <em>matters.</em> You might need to plant a subplot way in the beginning of the game to get your endgame to come off right - it takes a bit of planning to finish a story off with "When father saw her babies he knew he hd to allow the marriage." Whereas, with a game like D&amp;D, your narration doesn't matter; it's not authoritative or even informational to the other players. Everything that matters is embedded in the miniatures game.</p>
<p>Consequently, these games where narration is weak and insignificant actually cause narration atrophy, because one can be much more effective in the minis game if one's attention is not divided by this other thing that matters not at all.</p>
<p>So, like, there need to be constraints, but they have to encompass some power, or the kids will just not play in that sandbox.</p>

No offense intended here, but if this is truly how you feel, you should probably stop roleplaying. <br/><br/>I suspect you intended to use a different word than "embarassed." <br/><br/>I currently lack the confidence to spontaneously approach a room full of newbies with an RPG. I'd need some kind of reasonable segue, or a co-conspirator, or some glimmer of interest triggered by someone else. I suspect I'll get over this very quickly in the next few years, as I plan to share my hobby with my son when he's old enough to exercise his imagination in that way.                        </div>

Yeah, I was wondering that too.<br/><br/>As for me, I wouldn't be embarrassed too much to bring out D&amp;D to play with my Mom and Dad and maybe my stepbrother/stepsister over the holidays, so much as the feeling that I know it would be futile. The fun enjoyed by dungeon slayage would be overshadowed by the fact that there's just too much shit to learn to start off with (far more than a board game, for example, or Dominoes, a family favorite), and it would totally hang up play.  I love TROS and The Shadow of Yesterday too, but in those forms again it's hard to bust out with the extended family.  I dunno about Contenders, and I think PTA needs a little more work before it's smooth for new folks, but I can imagine wanting to roleplay with my folks (they are both big into Firefly, BSG, and Heroes for example), but I don't want to say "Yeah, we're going to pretend to be minor-grade superheroes; here's your character sheet with all your power scores and complex maneuvers". <br/><br/>I might be able to pull it off without too much confusion with something like Truth and Justice or Hearts and Souls. I'd love to bring out PTA for that, but I still think it needs kind of a primer for helping new folks who have never roleplayed in any form jump right in in a way that they get into the roleplaying bits (like the best games of PTA are) and not just some kind of weird "Once Upon a Time" narration game (like the worst games of PTA can turn into).<br/><br/>Oh! RISUS. Risus might be the game that I'd pull out to my family and step-relatives if I wanted to really throw down a traditional roleplaying experience for mainstream-kinds of folks. I might be able to get some juice out of Dogs in the Vineyard, too, but I think Risus may be easier to work with as a starter game. "Thespian 2d; Pirate 5d", what's not to understand here?<br/><br/>Also, I dunno about the talk of mainstream vs not mainstream. Like, currently, 'Pundit is shitting himself senseless with impotent rage reading this thread going "What's wrong with D&amp;D??? What's wrong with (insert average RPG here)???"  But it seems that right off the bat, Eric is asking folks: <br/><br/>"Which games exist, right now, that you'd totally bring out over the holidays <b>and play with your Mom and Dad</b>, perhaps even Grandmother?"<br/><br/>If I were playing around with my cousins or friends at a holiday get-together, I'd throw down some D&amp;D (probably Iron Heroes, actually, I find it a lot more stimulating with all the strategic/tactical stuff that goes on). Actually, we'd probably get sucked into Battlelore and never leave. But if I were pulling out a game for Cousin April, Aunt Polly, Dad, Brother-in-Law Koichi and Father-in-Law Saburo to throw down, it'd be something like RISUS; simple (for newbies), challenging, fun with the dice, and definitely the "my character" element.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

W/r/t my parents and parents-in-law, this would be an exercise in futility.  <br/><br/>There would be no RPG that they would enjoy, because, based on their temperament, they wouldn't enjoy RPGs. My in-laws would indulge me a bit more wholeheartedly, but it would still be an indulgence. <br/><br/>On the other hand, my nephews would be all over anything I offered to do. My niece might join up briefly out of curiosity. Nuff said there, since I prefer not to put my foot in my mouth in any way. <br/><br/>I'd probably start with Dead of Night, since that's the simplest game I'm most familiar with. I'd probably tweak it just a l ittle bit for action adventure or fantasy, since horror wouldn't be so good for younguns.                        </div>

                            No, really, I meant embarrassed.<br/><br/>Two weeks ago, I was with some non-gamer  friends. We'd just had dinner and some wine and wanted to play a game. <br/><br/>And it would have been embarrassing to suggest a roleplaying game.
<blockquote>Friend 1: OK, what shall we play?<br/>Graham: Well, look, there's this game about girlfriends hating each other.<br/>Friend 2: Oh, right.<br/>Graham: Yeah, we each play a girl, and we all like each other, but we hate each other too. So we hate one person for being smarter, one for being prettier...and it ends up like Sex And The City or Mallory Towers or something.<br/>Friend 1: It sounds a bit weird.<br/>Graham: No, it's fine. Look, here's a character sheet.<br/><i>[Everyone looks at Graham as though he's mad]</i><br/>Friend 2: This looks complicated.<br/>Friend 1: Could we just play Taboo?</blockquote>
And, of course, I didn't suggest a roleplaying game, and we just played Taboo. It was great.<br/><br/>See, I think we're in danger of deluding ourselves. People say "Sure, you could play Game X with your folks" or "I could totally pull out Game Y with my friends". But, in reality, they never do: and why would you, when you can play Taboo? I don't think there's a single roleplaying game that you'd actually pull out in those social situations.<br/><br/>(Incidentally, I mean "deluding ourselves" in a very gentle sense. I just mean that we're so enthusiastic about roleplaying games that we get carried away.)<br/><br/>And perhaps that's OK. Mike's post, near the start of this thread, was insightful: perhaps it's fine that RPGs are for gamers and we do different things with our folks and our friends.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Graham, I know where you're coming from. But in the last six months I've had several very positive reactions from non-gaming friends, and in the past I've had others. Now there are certainly those, including my dear wife, who probably never will get into roleplaying. But there are also people who will enjoy it, even if you are absolutely correct about the particular friends you mentioned.<br/><br/>Maybe you need to work on your pitch?                        </div>

                            Embarrassed is close, but maybe not quite perfectly accurate. But its the same feeling of rejection you get when asking somebody for a date, and they say no. That is, asking somebody to play a role-playing game is asking them to participate in something somewhat intimate. If they say no, that can hurt.<br/>
<br/>
Do you ask everyone who you find attractive out on a date? No? Same thing with RPGs. You have to have a sense that they'll say yes before asking is remotely comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
Now for some for whom RPGs might be "just a game" this might not be true. Or maybe some people are the sorts who ask everyone out, not fearing rejection at all. But I propose that any play with thematic elements can be just as socially intricate as any date for some of the people who play them.<br/>

Well I for one am not fond of anxiety (there, I think that's the term).<br/>
<br/>
But neither do I let it stop me. Again, I only let it temper who I ask to play and who I don't. Note that I have so many players that I don't often need to create more - I'm not playing enough with the ones who want to play. But I do occasionally make new gamers out of non-gamers.<br/>
<br/>
RPGs aren't just "geeky," they're intimately geeky.<br/>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><br/>"Which games exist, right now, that you'd totally bring out over the holidays<b>and play with your Mom and Dad</b>, perhaps even Grandmother?"</blockquote>
I believe this to be an inspiring challenge.  Do I think a game exists out of the box?  I don't believe so.  You need an approach for a wider audience.  Could you sell it to many folks and have them try it?  Sure.  Not my parents.  I think <i>Once Upon a Time</i> isn't a bad start.  It's pretty simple and approachable.<br/><br/>A possible different thread (probably even one that was already introduced):<br/>I would love to see some ideas/submissions batted around for someone to open a boardgame-like-box, pull out a few components and a card sized instruction book and play a role-playing game for two hours.<br/><br/>Of course, to start with there would be several questions to be answered (that often get discussed on these boards) like "what makes a role-playing game?"  I think there are two elements that would generally make it different than a boardgame and those would be "in character decision-making/interactions" and "building a story."<br/><br/>To talk about the "embarassed" reaction.  I understand it.  I understand the feeling of those around you not respecting your views or thinking them corney or questioning their validity.  This is a hobby that requires most people to actually think and to be honest I don't think many people actually do much of that outside the workplace.  My armchair observations tell me that most folk are more satisfied vegging, laughing and discussing things they really know nothing about.  RPGs require us not only to be introspective but to consider things outside the box.  Thus Mike is about on target when equating it to dating rejection.  Especially when equating one's self to an activity, summary rejection of that activity certain makes many people question their place doing something that others value so little. It's the same reason so many folk find it difficult to "agree to disagree."  They are tied up in their opinions.  To say you don't agree with them may equate to something wrong with their perception or reasoning for that opinion.  It's hard for some people to seperate themselves from that opinion.                        </div>

                            I think a lot of gamers are under the impression that they can almost *trick* a non-gamer into playing an rpg by introducing them to one with simple rules or a pseudo-rpg.  I'm not sure this is really the case.  I really enjoy rules-light games for their own sake, but my first game was 2nd ed. AD&amp;D, a fairly rules heavy game.  Even though I wasn't a fan of the huge complicated tables and systems, something about the medium sparked my imagination.<br/>
<br/>
Most people who play rpgs are along a similar mindset.  We understand the systems and concepts that go along with these games almost inherently, and it's kind of hard for us to understand why someone wouldn't.  I think we were all predisposed towards this before even played our first rpg.  When someone plays a rpg for the first time, they're either sparked or they're not.  I think the game has very little to do with it.<br/>
<br/>
Before I roleplayed, I was into Magic: the Gathering.  I don't think the two were connected however.  There's tons of people playing M:tG, WOW and a myriad of other fantasy based acronyms.  Even though they're flirting with the rpg concepts, most are perfectly happy where they are and have no interest in further immersing themselves in their games.<br/>
<br/>
I don't feel like there's a need for simplistic games just for the purpose of getting more people into them.  If anything, I think we just need to keep getting the word out on the good games already out there and the ones being created now.                        </div>

Oh, absolutely. I think there's a little weirdness in this thread about "mainstream" (making it sound like we want to make/share/promulgate the Perfect Game for the Masses), and yet then talk about games we'd share with people like relatives and the like, who might be into gaming but would definitely not be into the depth of rules and like. <br/><br/>So, to get people 'in general' into gaming, you don't need simplicity, you don't need to dumb shit down or whatever, you just need a good, solid game that's engaging and fun. ANY game. D&amp;D, Vampire, Dogs, whatever. This will get a non-gamer <b>who is predisposed to finding interest in the things that adventure games/RPGs do</b> into gaming.  But to get My Mom or Cousin Eikichi into gaming (for one night or whatever at Thanksgiving) into gaming, something fun, role-playing based, and enjoyable, for one evening... then complexity of rules has to be dropped. You can still get some slick shit out of a game without dumbing it down (again, peek at Risus).<br/><br/>Another game I think might work out for that one-shot with the family or non-gamer friends: AMBER. I mean, shit, there's no dice and the rules are fairly open ended. Another one might be something like The Whispering Vault, if you had friends or family that were into horror.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>Can you say more about the games you played with them, droog?</blockquote>
Sure â€“ I played <i>Nicotine GIrls</i> with my wife, and with a friend and her son. I played HQ with my neighbours. Both were easy and quick to set up and play. NG went over better than HQ, in my view, and in retrospect I'd use something else for that game. Glorantha is too much for newbs â€“ it's a gamer's world.<br/><br/>I also had the reaction I described a while back on SG from a non-gamer friend who borrowed my copy of IWaMD to read. Intrigued and enthusiastic, I'd call it. As I was saying, I'll have to get off my arse and organise the game as a social event.<br/><br/>Back when the only thing between me and the players was my mad skillz, I got quite a few people interested enough to play a game of eg RQ or <i>Pendragon</i>. i don't think they were that enjoyable for most of them, though I did my best the way I knew how (it worked for the gamers I knew). A minority of people I tested had fun that old-school way.                        </div>

I ran JAGS (rules-heavy, traditional, like GURPS) for 'em. I made the characters to their specifics. Set up the adventure and ran it straight. My folks are total non-gamers: 65+, retired. My father's from Cuba and worked as an electrical engineer for 30 years. My mother does Reiki energy-healing stuff ...<br/><br/>It ran *well* and they pretty much, I think, all got it. <br/><br/>My grandmother, before she passed away, was 90 so I doubt I'd have tried to do anything as intricate as roleplaying with her. But I'm guessing that  a trad, rules-heavy, RPG would be a very rare first choice for an introductory game ... and it ran easily.<br/><br/>Also note: I have introduced people to JAGS who are very much newbies (but not *entirely*) by letting them make characters with the character designer software. Having a char-gen tool really does help with that. I think that exposure/familiarity with computer MMPORGS has made most people somewhat accustomed to "making up a character."<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>

                            Well, consider this:<br/>1. I did the char-gen with a few decisions for them to make rather than throwing the whole thing at them.<br/>2. The concept of "roll this or less" if you want to do something was pretty easy for them to get. Maybe easier than dice-pools or what-not (but probably not easier than roll-over ... although the target number was printed on their character sheet).<br/>3. They understood the GM-Player power-split intuitively.<br/>4. Despite what we are told (in some places) equipment-lists and shopping for your character (including doing character-outfit) is *fun*. It wasn't the focus of the game, for certain, but when the characters went from straight-laced star-patrol cadets to crashed-on-a-pirate-station-needed-to-fit-in guys and raided a shady ship's wardrobe for clothes to fit in on the station, having them describe what they looked like was a big hit.<br/><br/>Don't forget the basics.<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>

                            "Chinese Menu" character creation is, I think, an option that indie gaming hasn't explored deeply enough.  That's (prettymuch) how HQ works, and I think it's one of its strong suits, especially since "Think up something of your own" is at the bottom of every list.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: somniturne</cite>I think a lot of gamers are under the impression that they can almost *trick* a non-gamer into playing an rpg by introducing them to one with simple rules or a pseudo-rpg. I'm not sure this is really the case. </blockquote>
I think you <b>do</b> have to *trick* the mainstream into roleplaying.  Parents and grandparents were the proposed target and although that can be very subjective (I know several 2nd generation gamers at this point) I think they are a good lithmus test for bringing in people that would otherwise be resistant.  My comments were keyed in on that, specifically - people that would otherwise be resistant.  And I don't mean people that probably wouldn't like roleplaying but more people that have preconceptions to what that means.  In the states specifically there is a social stigma associated with that sort of behavior and that stigma grows stronger as the participants get older.  So MY target for this question are not kids and not fandom and not social intellectuals or theatre folk.  These are all people that would be predisposed to enjoy role-playing *as is.*<br/><br/>So yes, I think it needs to be something that can be played with little prep and little explaination.  Something that allows the players to jump in and start interacting in character and building stories that they are interested in.  I don't think it needs to be a liscenced product but it would be cool if it could include or refer to something the players are familiar with like a series or favorite film.  I like to think of it as a gamer puts it in his back pocket and brings it to parties and when the time is right says hey I have this game to try.  by doing things this way I think you gain the advantage of introducing role-playing to people to find out if its the sort of thing they like while avoiding all the misconceptions.  Then if they like it, down the line, you follow up with "Let me tell you about Dogs or PTA."                        </div>

More than anything, I think the challenge is getting them past the first game.  You may be able to trick them into trying it, but unless they have at least some predisposition towards it they're not going to pursue the hobby.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><br/>Another game I think might work out for that one-shot with the family or non-gamer friends: AMBER.

Dread would also work well for horror-minded people. Two days ago I participated in what would have been a dream scenario for the RPGs-for-the-mainstream crowd if everyone involved in the event wasn't already a gamer. Here's what happened:<br/><br/>I was visiting a friend, and she wanted to get in touch with a group of people who weren't around for most of the year. Someone offered to run a game of Dread as the pretext for the meeting. When the time arrived however, the game wasn't ready. Despite having only run two sessions in the past, my friend dived into the rulebook and ran a sample scenario. It was amazing!<br/><br/>Character creation was simple -- "It's a lot like Firefly. Answer these questions about your character." Task resolution was familiar to anyone who knew how to play Jenga; there were problems on that front, but solved without the use of a rulebook or slowing down play. While I didn't check out the sample adventure afterward, it was meaty enough for the GM to spin an evening's entertainment out of about twenty minutes of prep time. I think that's all of the main points, right?                        </div>
