                    Hello,<br/><br/>Before I get into my actual play experience with Full Light, Full Steam I'd like to comment on the book itself.  When Josh posted the cover art, I was generally unimpressed.  I agreed with the sentiment that it appeared to be too cartoony.  I want to say that, as an artifact, it's much more impressive in three dimentions.  Given the size, the density, the color of the cover as whole, the cover art works much better.<br/><br/>I've only read to page 16 of the actual text and skimmed other sections but so far the prose is clean and extremely thurough.  I particularly enjoyed the revisionist history on why their are women in the military.  It explains enough to make the setup accessable to female characters but leaves the door wide open for gender politics to be an issue of play.  Just the way I would want it.  On the flip side this level of detail also applies to detailing the technical make up of a capital ship which I'm sure will delight anachrotechnophiles but is frankly the reason I only made it to page 16.  I will resume reading soon.<br/><br/>On to my actual experience with playing the game...<br/><br/>Well according to Josh's report on The Forge I got to play in the mediocre game of Full Light, Full Steam.  I concur with that assessment but I don't think the core issue was with the game.  So let me start by pointing out what I felt was the problem that sort of hindered this game.  None of the characters had goals to pursue and the GM (or anyone else) failed to bring any adversity into the game.  No game is going to survive those conditions.<br/><br/>So as per the setup of Full Light, Full Steam we're all members of the Royal Astronomical Navy and we're on a mission to Mars to investigate the complaints the Mayor of a colony there was having about the water suply.  So, the only goal we had was a kind of mystery to solve which usually results in poking around for clues ala Call of Cthulhu.  Only the poke around for clues style of play doesn't work with Full Light, Full Steam because of the Scene Pacing Mechanics.<br/><br/>Every player in the game is handed a small piece of paper called a Scrip.  When you're in a scene you can reference another player's Thematic Batteries (character attributes similar to Keys or Spiritual Attributes) and pass them the Scrip.  You get Spoils (i.e. XP) and they sign their name on the Scrip.  The scene ends when one player gets passed a fully signed Scrip and they choose to pass it on.  That player gets to frame the next scene.<br/><br/>When you have six players in the same opening scene of the game with no goals and no adversity this mechanic stalls out quick.  The result is a rather chaotic sequence of colorful but ultimately meaningless character banter in effort to pass the Scrips around so that the game can progress.  Add in a mystery situation and the desire to go out and investigate and the result is extremely clauster phobic.<br/><br/>I will note that there is a much easier way to exit a scene when the players are NOT all together.  You can simply pass a Scrip to a player not in the scene.  Your scene ends and their scene begins.  There's is also a way to pass the Scrip to the GM and have him frame a scene around the ship.  But I haven't gotten to that section of the book and we never used it in the game so I'm still a little unclear on how that works.<br/><br/>Now, I highly suspect this issue goes away with a smaller group but even with a full compliment of six players the solution is rather simple.  Scenes with all six characters in it should be overwhelmingly HUGE.  Frankly, I would have explained what our mission was and then started the game in the middle of a revolt on Mars, or an assassination attempt on the mayor, anything that would have made us all leap to action and need to rely on each other to succeed.<br/><br/>I think this Scrip system represents a potential solution to the problem of the battle scene in systems with single roll conflict resolution.  It encourages breaking down a larger scene into smaller sequences that spotlight each character.  But again, that requires the scene to be large enough to begin with.<br/><br/>So let's talk about rolling the dice.  Basically you have skills and attributes but they aren't added together or anything like that.  Instead you roll 4d6 and ordering the results from highest to lowest.  Then your attribute and skill combination tells you which two dice to pick and add.  Relatively simply and probably solves most of the problems that have been identified with the Skill + Attribute concept.<br/><br/>Enter Thematic Batteries.  So before you can use Thematic Batteries to help you, you must first use them to hinder you.  Basically you can wack off points from a skill or attribute before a roll to bank them into your Thematic Battery.  You do this by explaining how the the Thamatic Battery hinders you.  Then later by similarly referencing your Thematic Battery you can spend the points for boosting a skill or attribute before a roll.<br/><br/>The idea here is to voluntarily risk failure at conflict A in order to better succeed at conflict B.  In Full Light, Full Steam it's legal for players to call for die rolls and Josh encouranged us to make up reasons to roll to charge our batteries.  But with the lack of goals or adversity this ran afoul of Paul's Law that it is not fun to both make up and resolve your own adversity.  People were rolling for things like, "Do I show up on time to meet the captain?" which frankly failed to engage me.<br/><br/>Now, I *did* put in some effort to drive things myself.  I'm used to playing The Roach or Capes where the players have to share the burdon of bringing adversity to the scenario.  I noticed that half the players were not "proper Englishmen" (A Scott, An Indian, and A Martian Colonist).  So I decided by character was a bit of racist and started making comments about not trusting the "foriegn" members of the crew.<br/><br/>A couple of times I tried to take advantage of the rule that says  anyone can call for a die roll at any time.  At one point I requested that one of the players make a die roll to avoid offending the locals when he spit out their local spirits.  Probably my largest attempt to bring adversity into the game was when I asked one player to roll against another player to convince him to have my own character arrested for TREASON!<br/><br/>But frankly this group just wasn't on the ball, myself included.<br/><br/>However, my whole racism thing did pay off.  You see, it turned out that all the problems on Mars were caused by the Japanese.  Which means I got to do a great character reversal.  My fellow player character's who I had been bitching and complaining about all through the game were suddenly my best friends all fighting for "Queen and Country."  I nearly shouted, "I hate the BLODDY JAPANESE!" at the top of my lungs in a crowded convention hall.<br/><br/>Two great moments:<br/><br/>I got to distarge my Hot-Headed Thematic Battery while trying to locate a Japanese ether wave transmitter.<br/><br/>I got to deliver a morale boosting speech to a senior officer whose patrioticim I had been criticising up until then.<br/><br/>So the ending was cool, if the journey was a bit painful.<br/><br/>So most of my complaints largely had to do with the players at the table and the setup to the particular scenario.  I'm reserving judgement on the game as a whole until I finish reading the book and give the game a go with my own group.  There's a lot of potential I see in the mechanics that I didn't see getting utilized here.  I'm sure there's a lot of mechanics that we'ren't utilized at all.<br/><br/>So, now I will run and hide while Josh reads this.<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>

                            As the victim of a jury duty, mechanic's visit one-two punch that landed me well short of making GenCon, I'm sorry I didn't get a shot at FLFS with a bunch of strangers.  But I would like to put a hand up pre-emptively if SoCal type people wanted to play some FLFS in a more continuing venue.  I might even volunteer to run if not to host.                        </div>

                            Thanks for the AP, Jesse.<br/><br/>I'll cop to this one easy: I flubbed this game by presenting bits of the situation in the wrong order.  I really should have started this one out with the colonists trying to contact the Captain and him avoiding them, and then have him send the PCs down to see about the "traitors."  There would have been two "mysteries" to poke into, and the PCs would have found their way to the evaporation beacons sooner.  As it was, I was a little too subtle on the Captain's embarassment, and subtlety is generally a bad idea at a con game.  (The situation also sort of relied on the PCs caring about the Captain, which is more appropriate to a multi session game where the players have built up some attachment to him.)<br/><br/>Your observation that scenes with a lot of PCs should be the big huge scenes is spot-on, and that's going on the errata sheet for adding to later printings and editions.  Contrary to most traditional games, splitting the party is actually a good idea in this game, as it allows you to jumpcut back and forth.  The games over the weekend that did this were lots more fast-paced and engaging.  The everybody all together scenes should run like the last climactic scene we ran, with the assault on Deimos.<br/><br/>How successful did you find your little racism gambit to be, Jesse?  I noticed that some of the players were really confused by your inter-party hostility, but in the end, it did sort of pay off, so I'm wondering how you saw it.                        </div>

                            Well, it kind of worked.  <br/><br/>I the start of the game I put my extra points into Empathy, Etiquette and Leadership because my idea was that he was misanthropic curmudgeon who trusted his machines more than people but when the chips are down and back are to the wall he's actually the most understanding guy around.  That's what I was trying to get across with the motivational speech at the end.<br/><br/>There was a point I was actually going to pull a knife on the Patriotic XO character.  It was when we being shot at by the farmer.  I had the idea that perhaps that was the final straw for my xenophobic really wishes he was just back home character.  My idea was to take the XO hostage and use him as a barganing chip with the guy who was shooting at us.<br/><br/>Which raises some IIEE questions about Full Light, Full Steam.  In games like PtA or Sorcerer when someone announces I do X, there's usually an opportunity for anyone else to say what they want to do, and then we all roll together to see what the outcome of each attempt was.  The reason I didn't use my idea is because while I was still formulating it the Hot-Shot Pilot character said he was going to return fire and then that got rolled and resolved before I had a chance to say anything, so I dropped it.<br/><br/>I was very happy when The Marine suggested I be arrested for treason.  That's why I called for a roll.  I was hoping he would succeed.  If that was the case I was going to try to escape and go talk to other farmers and maybe the Americans....and... and... well, it didn't happen so I'm not quite sure where I would have gone from there.<br/><br/>Overall, I guess it succeeded to some extent but not quite to the level I would have liked.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>

As an after the fact antidote, I know the guy sitting to your immediate left, Jess, was upset that you didn't play your character "right".  I think he was the player that was in two separate groups, so had chance to see the Hot Headed character run under two different flavors.  As I helped Josh clean up the game's materials, I over heard him talking to the guy who played the Indian that you didn't play it was it'd been written, which from a creative stand point, I actually found kind of interesting.  The guy who ran Avery before you did it "right" because that was what he saw first, thus making you "wrong" despite the fact <em>both</em> you and the Avery before were working with simple frame works that you were left to flesh out for yourselves.<br/><br/>Josh, as a GM, did you find it helped or hurt your games that you were working with the same characters in completely different dynamics?  I tend to highly identify with characters, whether I'm GMing or playing them, so the idea of "transplanting" has never ever made sense to me.  So I'm wondering how it worked across four games?                        </div>

I've gotten this more than once in the past at cons.  I'm not sure it's totally because he saw another player do it.  There's a trend among a certain kind of role-player who sees a list of character traits and imediately assumes that there's a specific "way" the character is "meant" to be played.  I invoke the ire of these players a lot because the very first things I do is look for "the twist."  That is, I look at what the baseline character looks like (to me) on paper and then think of the one way he's not like that.  In this case it was the Empathy aspect.  The idea that no matter how much he hates people he can't help feeling sorry for them.<br/><br/>I think I've told you about this but the last time this happend to me was at a con in a Changleling game.  We were all playing children and my character was a Satyr.  Satyr's (to me) are extremely sexually charged and so I was playing him like a sexually moody teenager whose just discovered that women are soft and warm and kind of fun to cuddle but isn't sure what to do about it.  The GM *sought me out* after the game to specifically tell me that I clearly had NO IDEA how to play Satyr child and that I should remember for future that young Satyrs are playfull and love to frolick.<br/><br/>Really?  And what Satyr children have you met recently?  Need I remind you that: SATYRS DON'T EXIST.<br/><br/>Ehem....<br/><br/>Ron talks about this phenomenon a lot with one of the Sorcerer demo games he uses.  He's run it multiple times and gets vastly different takes on the characters everytime.  And yet, everytime each individual points to something on the character sheet and says, "I'm just doing what it says here."  I've never understood people's denial of their own ownership and judgement about character concepts.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>

                            As GM I didn't find it terribly distracting, although I was pretty intent on getting the rules across and accepting any suggestions that the players thought would be appropriate to the stats they were using (I had a player use Brawn and Acquaintances -- cause he was side-by-side with the other marines digging the ship out of the Venerian mud -- I thought it rather clever).<br/><br/>On the other hand, though, I tend to think of these situations like stage plays where a character gets played by more than one actor, and each actor brings something different to the character.  So while it didn't fluster me that some characters were portrayed very differently (including changing sex), I was certainly aware of the differences, and enjoyed being aware of them.<br/><br/>Another part of it may be, though, that this sort of play is rather well-served (unintentionally) by <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em>.  Already you have the other players throwing scrips at you trying to reference your thematic batteries, so exactly what a Rake or a Hot Temper or a Scot "is" is up for questioning and exploration.  That there were different people at the controls wasn't too much different than having all the players at the table characterize each other.  Character "ownership" is rather explicitly highlighted and complicated, so portraying a given character "correctly" almost didn't register when the other player mentioned it.                        </div>

                            I also played is this game as the hot-shot, genteel, young pilot.  I agree with you, Jesse, the beginning of the game was chaotic.  And I didn't know the players were responsible for driving the story from the get-go.  I suppose I should have figured that out after the explantion of scripts.  However, I was a bit tired after playing Burning Wheel (8AM start time!).  As a player I enjoyed your 'abusing' the CO, but my character didn't quite know how to react so I didn't respond while you taunted him.  Now I wish I hadn't shot the farmer just to see where the game would have went.   I also liked your morale speech.<br/>
<br/>
Joshua, I think the PC's cared more about sucking up to the captain, then caring about him (myself included).  I also thought the party members who recieved the gift for the captain should have followed up on that.  But, as my character didn't know that info, I didn't mention it.  I was just happy to get a chance to play the game.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding character interpretation:  I played up the young and genteel thematic batteries of my character.  I felt he would only be a hot-shot in this element--piloting a spacecraft.  I only got to pilot at the end even then I blew my roll!  Jesse, I perceived your character as more disgruntled and grumpy than hot-headed.  Near the end I realized your character's rage roiled just below the surface.                        </div>
