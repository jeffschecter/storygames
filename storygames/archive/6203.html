Does you game, maybe, have rules-in-opposition which can be best referenced from different sides of the screen one makes? Or are there discrete stages to play, which one might want to open to and lay flat (I think that's why this kit is out there: photo books that can be "set" to different pages from day to day).<br/><br/>Basically, if the form factor doesn't give a benefit to the book's use, I'd drop it and go digest.

I've worked behind the scenes on projects (as the graphic designer &amp; production coordinator) with lulu and they do offer quite a lot of customization options, but the accordion book would still probably run pretty high cost due to the hand work involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did have an acquaintance who produced a book of photography in the accordion format. The book itself was about 6.5" tall by 4" wide with about 10 or 12 panels. She had a place that does artists glicee's (a fancy word for high quality inkjet prints) on large paper. She ran about 6 or 7 sets of the internal pages on one sheet of out put. She then had them scored and trimmed by a printer. She folded and glued the sheets onto covers that she had output on her Epson inkjet printer (she had one of their Photostylus printers). All-in-all still pretty hand work intensive -- but the effect was beautiful!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that she sold each (and sold out) for $35.00. I realize that you might not be able to get that kind of pricepoint for a game, but it might be relevant for a "special edition."<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that maybe this helps.<br/>\nDale                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia" title="Parthenia"><img alt="Parthenia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/146/nKIT0S5D0Y5QY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia">Parthenia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137712/#Comment_137712" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-02T12:50:07+00:00" title="April  2, 2008 12:50PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That totally helps.

I don't want it to be too small because I want as many illustrations as I can fit. I plan to make it a really short game with simple rules. I never heard back from Fidlar Doubleday, so I'd like to get more quotes from other printers. I'm thinking (down the road) 10-25 artist book editions at a higher cost, and then a regular saddle stapled or (if it's long enough) perfect bound printing at a low cost (like $5-$10). <br/><br/>At GenCon James Brown had 5 special editions of Blood and Bronze, which came with hand hammered bowls and coins. They were beautiful. The idea totally works with my interest in making games for people who aren't traditional gamers.

That said, you could have eight printed in parallel (60/7.5), and being on rolls, the "long" strip could be arbitrarily long, to allow for more than 10 pages. You might not be *exactly* 7.5 high, once cutting into strip occurs (be off my a millimeter or less), but it would be hard to tell otherwise.<br/><br/>So, with a 60" x 75" "chunk" (signature-ish), you get eight copies. Of course... most web press operators want at least a few hundred, if not a thousand, copies per run; and you'd have to pay an upfront cost for the plates (1 to 4 or more, depending on use of color--spot or process--and any glosses or odd inks like metallics). And folding, and gluing a front and back cover--actually, that means youu'd need 2 additional "pages" to attach to the covers, unless you want your first and last printed pages to be possibly affected by the gluing process.<br/><br/>It's doable, but not cheaply. Have you considered talking with major suppliers of erotica (Adam and Eve, here) about them carrying your book, if you self-produce? You might be able to get into a risk- and profit-sharing arrangement, and you'd at least get a much broader exposure in their catalogs and web site than you'd likely enjoy in "conventional" RPG channels.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138138/#Comment_138138" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-04T09:47:44+00:00" title="April  4, 2008  9:47AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ditto - What you might try for the Artisan Editions is to print a couple of sets on the largest stock you can easily get and glue them in the back.

Nowhere near that. Don't forget that most books are printed web press, and they typically have signatures MUCH larger than the "eighth of a signature" strips for an accordion book. What would be more likely is that she'd have to order an order of magnitude more individual copies to hit the "paper and ink usage" levels of a normal, couple-hundred-page book. As such, the per-unit price will actually be tiny; though the total cost for the full run will compare to short run costs for "traditional" digest books, due to that "gotta burn up X paper and Y ink to make it worth setting up the press and pushing the buttons".<br/><br/>So for what any indie publisher would consider "reasonable" for a run--plus, maybe, a "fiddly charge" since they can't use a conventional bindery, and have to fold and cut odd-shaped signatures. But, in the end, being such a small fraction of the total run, and individual book should be quite cheap. Which is good, because you'll prolly have a couple thousand of them to unload! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
