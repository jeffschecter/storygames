A tenderpaw's mentor forced her to watch the torture, to teach her what desperate times called for, but the tenderpaw was fine with that - she wanted to see. The other tenderpaw left the room but still heard the screams. Brutal frickin' mice, yo.<br/><br/>But I can't help feeling I'm doing it wrong.<br/><br/>1)<br/> I'm supposed to be challenging beliefs and instincts and I'm trying but it always feels ... murky. There's never a moment where it's clearly 'you have to decide, follow the belief or realize that it doesn't apply in this situation' - that Han Solo moment where he decides to join the fight despite himself.  <br/>For example, because one mouse's belief is 'every mouse has a hero inside' there are a lot of unheroic mice in the game - but just because of what the players do and what makes sense for the story, I've been having trouble putting those unheroic mice in the same room as the mouse with that belief and getting them to interact.<br/>Another example - one mouse's instinct is 'always see if there's more to the situation than meets the eye' - so I do a 'she's going to kill the hostage, what do you do?!" thing. But the way the player saw it was the mouse had already scouted the place out beforehand and determined, 'nope, there's nothing more to this situation than meets the eye, time to act.' <br/>So. Am I doing it wrong ... or are my expectations out-of-whack ... or should I expect more than 3 sessions to get those Han Solo moments ... ?<br/><br/>2)<br/>Another thing is difficulty - I'm creating challenges that I think will be medium-hard.  A fox.  A weasel patrol.  And the players keep frickin' slam-dunking these things, often in the first round of the conflict. Should I be ramping up difficulty massively ... or is difficulty not not the point?<br/><br/>3) <br/>How do you decide when to go for the kill in a conflict? We had a cornered weasel conflict, and the obvious goal for her was to escape - but it seemed to me since by conflict rules it was just as easy for her to kill everyone as to escape, why not go for the kill?  I went for escape. What would you have done?  (Turned out not to matter, see above with frickin' slam dunk, but.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374203/#Comment_374203" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-24T10:03:20+00:00" title="April 24, 2012 10:03AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2012 10:04AM by J_Walton.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my XP, Mouse Guard is robust and well-designed, so it can survive quite a lot of stretching and "playing it wrong" and still deliver a fun time. I ran MG in Boston and kinda defied most of the GMing guidance and it was still awesome.  I ran a hack for post-apocalyptic valkyries and (not having learned my lesson) defied a bunch of the basic guidance again; that time it was more of a mixed experience, but the players involved still can't stop thinking and talking about that game, for whatever reason. And, more recently, John and I hacked it into this one-on-one black ops game set in Guyana, which was awesome even though it broke all sorts of rules. Still, it's best at doing what it's designed to do and always kicks ass when I run it straight at conventions.<br/><br/>1.) Challenging beliefs can be super hard. It's much more difficult as GM guidance than something more neutral like "play to find out what happens," though you do that in Mouse Guard too. My sense of it -- which may be different from long-time BW players -- is that it's not quite your job as GM to challenge their beliefs all the time, in every session, constantly. That's exhausting and maybe not super-functional. Instead, it's your job to set up situations that challenge or cast doubt on their beliefs and then see how they respond. These can be small-scale situations that last a single scene or large scale situations that take an entire arc to play out. And once you set these things up, you just play them out and let the chips fall where they may.  <i>Just play your NPCs (and the natural world)</i> and don't worry about pushing the players' buttons. If you've designed the NPCs and situation well, then you'll be challenging their beliefs. No need to force it unnaturally.<br/><br/>2) Difficulty in Mouse Guard is an interesting topic. My XP is that -- when the entire patrol is cooperating and they roll average-to-good results -- they can take on some pretty intimidating challenges and come out just fine. And that makes sense, given the comics and the themes of the game. However, if the patrol is split up, if one or more members are isolated, if patrol members have different goals, if they have to divide into smaller groups to deal with multiple threats, or if the dice are just being really mean to them... all of a sudden, things can get really dire very quickly. That also makes sense I think. My suggestion, then, is not to always make things harder (don't feel like you have to pull out a moose or a bear), but make them more complicated or involve multiple things happening at once, so the players have to make hard choices about what their priorities are and what they care about. You don't want to do that all the time; part of the fun is the characters succeeding at stuff, not always having to suck up horrible consequences, but it's good to sprinkle in some things that'll give them pause and make them decide. That, in and of itself, will also help challenge their beliefs.<br/><br/>3) Choose your NPC's goals in the conflict based on the NPC's fictional goals. No other considerations are necessary.  If the weasel wanted to escape, they wanted to escape. Don't second-guess yourself on this; it just makes more work for the GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374205/#Comment_374205" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-24T10:24:48+00:00" title="April 24, 2012 10:24AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2012 10:31AM by jessecoombs.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan's answers are good.<br/><br/>My thoughts:<br/><br/>1. If you're keeping their beliefs in mind, you're already doing something right. If there's nothing interesting or tangible to grab hold of there, try challenging their goals. You could even tempt their instincts in tricky situations. Just make sure you're following the end of session procedures to the letter and with a hard line. If they aren't earning fate or persona points, you should not bend the questions to give them points. They should hopefully notice they aren't getting rewarded and start pushing for moments in the game where they will be challenged; this should make your job easier. Or they can change their beliefs.<br/><br/>2. Don't worry about specific things too easy or too hard, just do what makes sense. It seems you are doing that. That being said, use the GM's turn to grind them into the dirt. There are a lot of tools in your toolbox for really beating them up. Take a look at their character sheets and see what would be tough for them to handle. If you've got a bunch of fighters, give them some social challenges or have them build something. You are in charge of the GM's turn, so don't let them have the reigns during this time. Use weather. Take their stuff. Hurt their friends. Do all this stuff as hard as you can, keeping those beliefs in your head to theme it or decide how.<br/><br/>Also, if you just can't seem to make things hard enough for them, and they are steamrolling everything, eventually their skills will plateau. They need failures to get better at things. When they notice this, they should start doing more and more crazy and difficult things to earn those "F's". It's one of the slowest mechanics in the game, but it's incredibly rewarding when it kicks in and the players realize what they need to grow. That will take a few more sessions at least.<br/><br/>3. Your instincts seem right on the money here. I would've done the same thing. Do what makes sense in the fiction. <br/><br/>I do have one question; are you remembering to factor in the little fiddly things like conditions and factors like weather? I've noticed that Mouse Guard will fall apart if you're fudging things too much. I'm a stickler for rules, so I kind of love this kind of thing. I even make use of the inventory rules.<br/><br/>Man, this is making me want to start up MG again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374207/#Comment_374207" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-24T10:28:24+00:00" title="April 24, 2012 10:28AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2012 10:28AM by jessecoombs.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and if they are kicking your ass because they are working as a team, that's supposed to happen.

It's pretty hard to break, actually. I've run one-shot con games where everyone waltzed through the conflicts because they set stuff up right, and it still felt challenging and engaging to the players - it was like they were being rewarded for thinking about the conflict. In my experience, the scripted conflict really makes it much more about taking part than winning, anyways - they get to work out what cool stuff they did to beat the odds and roll the dice. I tend add in the grimness by them sometimes being too effective, and in simple conflicts (which are often much harder, actually) - like by having them recruit a bunch of untrained, innocent militia to fight the weasels who've laid siege to the town. They still won the siege, but those kids were dropping like flies as they threw themselves at the weasels (after much inspirational Orator checks from the Patrol Leader).<br/><br/>I don't think you can 'force' hitting beliefs and instincts - just keep them in mind, like Jesse said, and let the players chew up the scenery over them if they want to.<br/><br/>After I last ran MG at a con (Conpulsion in Edinburgh) I had a brief conversation with one of the players, who was also experienced at running MG at cons, and it sounded like we did things completely differently, while still playing by the rules, so to speak. And I reckon both ways probably worked.<br/><br/>That said, if you haven't had war geese feature in your game (HONK!), you're definitely doing it wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374214/#Comment_374214" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-24T11:14:42+00:00" title="April 24, 2012 11:14AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2012 11:25AM by Bret_Gillan.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's different ways to challenge Beliefs. It doesn't always have to be, "Do you really believe this thing that you believe? How about all these things that prove you wrong?!" Sometimes it can just be "In order to do that thing you believe you have to fight some tough dudes in the way." Sometimes challenging Beliefs means doing or seeing things that prove the belief right (even though it doesn't sound like it). Personally, I like to do these two things for awhile before I start creating situations that undermine the players Beliefs and even after that switch bak and forth.<br/><br/>Put the mouse you described in situations where someone wants to be a hero but doubts themself. Put them in situations where a mouse finds the hero in themself and save the day. Put them in situations where a mouse finds the hero in themself and destroys them! Put them in a situation where a mouse found the hero in themself and got thrown in prison for it. Someone is being a hero right now and in front of you and is outnumbered! Etc. And maybe they don't need to be in the same room interacting, just make sure the PC mouse hears about it so they can pursue it on the player turn.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374217/#Comment_374217" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-24T11:35:18+00:00" title="April 24, 2012 11:35AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2012 11:46AM by J_Walton.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jessecoombs</cite> are you remembering to factor in the little fiddly things like conditions and factors like weather?

Fudging kills MG dead and was the major thing I learned from trying to wing it based on inappropriate GM instincts. There are all sorts of ways your instincts may be telling you to fudge stuff and most of them are wrong. It's worth paying attention and trying to put a stop to it.<br/><br/>1. Don't make up difficulties off the top of your head, especially at first.  Don't do the thing were you go, "Oh, that's probably Ob 2." Look up the skill factors and figure it out like you're supposed to, as much as possible. Also, if they're rolling against an NPC, don't make up an Ob. Roll dice for that NPC based on one of the example NPC writeups, using the appropriate skill or stat.<br/><br/>2. Ruthlessly enforce the penalties for conditions, otherwise having them doesn't ever matter. Make them remove penalties using the rules for doing so, spending checks and the whole business.<br/><br/>3. When it's the GM's turn, do the GM turn thing. This may seem obvious, but it's not always. It's easy to just follow the fiction and do a whole bunch of wandery stuff that's not what's supposed to happen in the GM turn. Mouse Guard isn't all "sandboxy" in the GM turn.  Instead, the GM presents the players with (2) challenges that they have to overcome. The way that the players overcome the challenges is totally up to them, but they must confront them if they are going to complete their mission. If the players want to take on more than 2 challenges, that's up to them, but the GM has to bring at least 2. The challenges follow more or less directly after each other and you can even sometimes announce them before the GM turn starts, if you want some accountability to the players.  Say like: "So the challenges this time around will be (1) traveling through the muddy spring terrain to Marshbrook and (2) dealing with their baby snapping turtle infestation." Sometimes they won't know the challenges in advance like this, but often they will, just from their mission orders. Then you play out those challenges, based on how the players decide to approach them.<br/><br/>4. The player turn is where it gets much more sandboxy. Let the players do whatever they want to do and then, ideally, use what they do in the player turn (and the previous GM turn) to create future potential challenges for your next GM turn.  Are they preparing to travel somewhere? That's a good excuse for a challenge. Who's upset by the things they accomplished last session? There's a new potential challenge. What will Gwendolyn order them to do next? There's probably some challenges involved. So set up a couple for the next session and keep others in reserve as potential complications.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374221/#Comment_374221" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-24T12:19:29+00:00" title="April 24, 2012 12:19PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jamie, if you still feel like you're doing it wrong after your next session, let us know.

The first few times I ran it, I treated things much more fast-and-loose, which ended up sometimes working and sometimes not (surprise!).  It reminds me very much of Bliss Stage, which has a similar "mission + refresh" structure, in that you have to hit the mission + GM turns really hard in the beginning to enable you to do somewhat looser things later.  Like, after doing several missions for Gwendolyn and the Guard, you can totally do that thing where you go: "Okay, so after failing that complication, you're isolated in an underground weasel cavern full of mouse skeletons, and your current mission orders are pretty much out the window now. Nobody can get new orders to you because nobody knows where you are. What's your plan, patrol leader?"  But that looser style of play only becomes both frightening and freeing in an "off the ranch" way after you've established what normal looks like. If you normally handle things that way, then you're not playing Mouse Guard so much as wandering murder-hobo mercenary adventurers who just happen to be mice, like it's D&amp;D or something.<br/><br/>Another trick that I find works really well is letting a whole bunch of time pass between sessions or seasons, especially once a "mission arc" has been completed.  My advice is to do one "mission arc" a season.  Go somewhere, deal with the problems, deal with the fallout and aftermath of dealing with the problems, and learn some new things about the larger forces at work (frex: owl cult, anti-guard conspiracy, weasel activities, whatever). Then, that's it for that season, even it was only a session or two. Let time pass and then pick things up in the next season or have a Winter session. The feeling of time and nature is very crucial to MG.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374305/#Comment_374305" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-25T07:21:33+00:00" title="April 25, 2012  7:21AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Every time I've run this game, the players spend the first GM turn getting destroyed, heaving under the weight of tons of conditions, and then wanting to die.

Like, you have two challenges that they're facing, right? Unless they specifically decide to tackle some other things.  And that might be a couple Ob rolls and a full-on conflict (could just be two rolls, no conflict).  Failing one of those rolls or losing the conflict might get them a condition or maybe even two (if they fail both and you're feeling particularly ruthless). But it's not like every mouse in the patrol has to make every Ob roll that comes up (maybe one mouse rolls and the others try to help if they can). Plus, if they cooperate in the initial conflict, they have a pretty good chance of succeeding.

Then they sort of trundle along with a downcast "you always fail in this game" mindset. I think part of understanding how to play is to recognize that failing a single skill roll is rarely fatal, so if a roll looks like it'll be tough it's OK to tank it by using a trait negatively and earning some checks (plus, if you get a twist that's usually an opportunity for more skill rolls, which will help you advance your skills). Also, the Sick and Injured conditions are pretty intense, so the GM should probably not throw them around lightly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374324/#Comment_374324" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-25T10:38:55+00:00" title="April 25, 2012 10:38AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>For example, because one mouse's belief is 'every mouse has a hero inside' ...<br/><br/>Another example - one mouse's instinct is 'always see if there's more to the situation than meets the eye' ...</blockquote>\nThose seem kind of weak Beliefs and Instincts to me, and weak or unclear Beliefs and Instincts are always a source of GM pain, IME.<br/><br/>Granted, I am speaking from more of a BW perspective than MG (though I have played and run MG).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374326/#Comment_374326" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-25T10:43:07+00:00" title="April 25, 2012 10:43AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Honestly, those BITs sound fine to me.

When you give them a belief-serve, are they returning it, or are they letting it sail past them?

Or maybe they're missing your serve?<br/><br/>I know sometimes as a GM I'll feel like I'm sledgehammering a flag and it'll go completely unnoticed, it usually just turns out that I was being too opaque or that the player wasn't interested in the flag anymore but was ignoring it instead of explicitly rejecting it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374376/#Comment_374376" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-25T15:46:18+00:00" title="April 25, 2012  3:46PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2012 3:59PM by johnzo.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (quiet afternoon so you get a double response)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>For example, because one mouse's belief is 'every mouse has a hero inside' there are a lot of unheroic mice in the game - but just because of what the players do and what makes sense for the story, I've been having trouble putting those unheroic mice in the same room as the mouse with that belief and getting them to interact.<br/>Another example - one mouse's instinct is 'always see if there's more to the situation than meets the eye' - so I do a 'she's going to kill the hostage, what do you do?!" thing. But the way the player saw it was the mouse had already scouted the place out beforehand and determined, 'nope, there's nothing more to this situation than meets the eye, time to act.'<br/>So. Am I doing it wrong ... or are my expectations out-of-whack ... or should I expect more than 3 sessions to get those Han Solo moments ... ?<br/></blockquote>\nIdea 1: During the GM turn, you are in the drivers' seat.  <b>Frame really hard</b> against Beliefs and Instincts during the GM turn.  Don't just frame Belief triggers "into the room" -- instead, frame them onto the backs and into the laps of the patrol mice.  <br/><br/>Idea 2: Don't challenge Beliefs in isolation.  Instead of challenging Affirm Belief vs. Reject Belief, challenge Belief vs Goal or Belief vs mission. or Belief vs. Instinct.  Go intercharacter with this as well, look for opportunities to place one mouse's BIGs in opposition to another mouse's BIGs.  The Angry condition was made for this kind of thing!<br/><br/>Using these two principles, here's how I'd challenge that 'every mouse is a hero' Belief: <br/><br/>A day or so away from town, I'd insert a feisty and likeable but inept guardmouse wannabe into the patrol's mission.  The wannabe has followed the patrol all the way from town and now she has revealed herself and wants to help!<br/><br/>What does our guard mouse do?  Do they argue to bring her along so that she can learn how to be a hero?  This satisfies the Belief but complicates the mission (and maybe some Goals).  Do they argue to send her home?  This satisfies the mission at the expense of the Belief.  Or do they argue to suspend the mission so they can escort her back to the city?  Both the Belief and the mission suffer here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374498/#Comment_374498" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-26T09:15:24+00:00" title="April 26, 2012  9:15AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite>You mention "what the players do" -- would you say that the players are cooperating with your attempts to challenge their beliefs?

If more pops up, awesome, but I'm not too worried about it. The Mouse Guard rules will push shit to the forefront eventually. <br/><br/>-So, from one player, yeah, I'm pushing that belief hard; even using it as the theme for the session.<br/><br/>-From another, maybe I'm eyeing that skill they are really good at.

Am I using meta-strategy to hit the players? Yep.

In that case, yes, you're doing it wrong. But, from what you said upthread, that sounds like the only thing you're really doing that's not in line with the game's rules and principles. It's just a damn important one.<br/><br/>What I think, in a broader sense, may be a source of frustration for some people with MG is simply not realizing going in how dark it is, because there are these adorable mice with swords! And so they expect the fiction to reflect that cuteness, when in fact it often goes really tragic really fast. I think my number one advice for GMs, coming from a number of conversations about this topic, is to really explain how harsh MG is supposed to be.<br/><br/>It's also a perpetual frustration with BW and MG one-shots that you don't see how much failure helps you advance. I like jenskot's idea of filling in some bubbles ahead of time, so that advancing during session becomes a real possibility, though I've always been too lazy to do it. Failing always stings a bit, but it can really help mitigate the sting when you're playing long-term.<br/><br/>Oh, speaking of which\u2014try not imposing conditions, especially the more severe ones, during the GM's turn.

A fox is Nature 7 and has some decent weapons in a fight, so I wouldn't think it would be a pushover, even for a very combat-focused patrol.

If more pops up, awesome, but I'm not too worried about it.

Also if you stoke intermouse conflict you can chillax while the players hash out their feelings.  If you're feeling mean, you can disrupt this resolution with a visit from the owl cult. Conflictus interruptus can add layers and depth to your ongoing game, as intermouse drama piles up without resolution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374641/#Comment_374641" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-26T21:31:06+00:00" title="April 26, 2012  9:31PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite>But note that if you figure out a way to place two characters' BIGs in opposition, you'll be able to spotlight multiple players at once.<br/></blockquote>\nYou can also point two characters' BIGs in the SAME direction at something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374643/#Comment_374643" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-26T21:39:30+00:00" title="April 26, 2012  9:39PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, intertwining two beliefs hasn't happened at my table, unless I wasn't paying attention.
