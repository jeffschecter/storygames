All the GM slots are filled, but there are plenty of player slots.  I could list the awesome games here with openings and pimp my own, but instead I'll just point you to the link.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.endgameoakland.com/minicon/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.endgameoakland.com/minicon/</a><br/><br/>If you've been before, you know how awesome the Minicon is. And if you haven't, get yourself over there!  Endgame's enourmous store has a whole upper level dedicated to gameplay space. All the players and GMs I've played with have been fantastic.  You can just sign up for (and pay for) the games you want to play, so there's no badge to buy if you can only make it for a four hour session.  If you can make it the whole day, it's well worth it. There are plenty of places to eat within walking distance, as well as snacks and sodas in the store itself.<br/><br/>And I'm not involved in any official capacity, I'm just an excited participant.  I think the Minicons are the best gaming events in the Bay Area, without peer, especially if you are looking for indie gaming, but the more traditional selections rock it as well, so you can't really go wrong. <br/><br/>If you're already planning on going, give a shout out and I hope to see you there!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson" title="Ben_Johnson"><img alt="Ben_Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/2131054135_2403ed15ce_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson">Ben_Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169167/#Comment_169167" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-15T13:32:23+00:00" title="September 15, 2008  1:32PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll be there for the afternoon 3:16 session, and the evening run of Don't Rest Your Head.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172623/#Comment_172623" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-02T10:34:49+00:00" title="October  2, 2008 10:34AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's almost time!<br/><br/>Seats still open for my Grey Ranks game in the morning, as well as Houses of the Blooded, 3:16, D&amp;D 4th, and Don't Rest Your Head.<br/><br/>Ben, I'll see you at the even DRYH game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172904/#Comment_172904" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T12:47:12+00:00" title="October  3, 2008 12:47PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am in Canada and am unfortunately going to miss this.<br/><br/>But if you are anywhere in the Bay Area, you owe it to yourself to check out EndGame's excellent minicons.

It worked out fine, and very bloodily.  The Wax King has a new assistant spymaster (a PC) who brought him the God of Knives.<br/><br/>I also had Big Fun running DRYH/Shadowrun for the first time in the afternoon. It was my first time adapting that, but I really liked how the Edge (Exhaustion) build-up created a ton of tension towards the end, when any roll could be their last.  The treacherous Mr. Johnson got what he deserved, the treacherous PC got away spotless.  That's life on the edge.<br/><br/>Of course, any game is more fun with great players, and I'm very happy both games filled with 4 players.  Pleasingly, both finished on the dot at 4 hours, and a lot happened. DRYH is excellent for density of action.<br/><br/>Since as always when running I pay no attention to what's going on around me, I'm eager to hear how the other games went, especially the three sessions of 3:16.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173872/#Comment_173872" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T12:04:06+00:00" title="October  7, 2008 12:04PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran Grey Ranks.  It was a little bumpy, but I put that blame at my feet and being rusty with the rules. I realized part way through that I dropped the ball on explaining the missions properly. We could have been more aggressive on the scene hand-offs. We had some great moments though, playing chapters 5, 6, and 7 - surprisingly winning most of the missions. There was some young romance, which lead to a rushed wedding between two characters, who then got separated and were unable to find each other after the war. A very angry jewish kid who murdered his own uncle when he discovered he was collaborating. And the girl who gave her life distracting the Germans so they wouldn't discover a failed escape attempt.  <br/><br/>I ran In A Wicked Age, which kicked all kinds of ass.  I got the timing down perfect, so we had exactly two hours for each chapter, and that really helped give us time to take what we learned from the first chapter and hit it out of the park in the second.  I really wish we could have played the 3rd chapter because the Owe List character was perfect for what occurred in the final scene. It ended on a high note, to say the least.<br/><br/>I'll probably write more about both in separate Actual Play reports if I get some time.<br/><br/>I also played in Overtime in the Mad City, a Don't Rest Your Head scenario by Ryan Macklin.  It was really fun. It was a predefined opening situation: we're the last workers at a company an (NPC) employee that we all like is killed. We got to determine what kind of office it was (a porn website), what our jobs were, and what unusual features our boss had (like a permanent rictus grin and hands made of electricty). It really helped kick off the game with the characters knowing each other and having a reason to stay together. Which seems critical for a four hour con game.<br/><br/>The only terrible thing about the Minicon is that it's only one day and three games. I really would have liked to been able to play in some of the other games, especially one of the seemingly wall-to-wall 3:16 games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
