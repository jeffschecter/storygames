                    As I've mentioned previously, I'm using Clinton Nixon's Solar System (as in The Shadow of Yesterday) as the system for my quest game <a href="http://www.csidemedia.com/wiki/pmwiki.php/Errantry/HomePage" rel="nofollow">Errantry</a>.<br/><br/>I've gradually become aware that I need to do a complete rewrite on the rules, though. In part this is because Clinton's writing style and mine are very different, and the seams between the two show (he is colloquial and chatty, I'm more formal and concise), but I think there are also opportunities for the rules to be clarified by a new presentation.<br/><br/>I'm not implying any criticism of Clinton or his game here, by the way. I obviously like it a lot or I wouldn't be using it as the basis for my work. <br/><br/>So, some questions for everyone familiar with TSOY (and especially Clinton):<br/><br/>1. If you could add just one thing to the rules, what would it be?<br/><br/>2. If you could remove just one thing, what would it be?<br/><br/>3. If you could change just one thing, what would it be?<br/><br/>4. If you could clarify just one rule, which rule would you pick?<br/><br/>Obviously anything directly to do with Clinton's default setting (the World of Near) is off-topic - this is about the system, for use in a different setting.<br/><br/>I look forward to the collective wisdom.<br/><br/>EDIT: I've already looked over the material at RandomWiki.                </div>

                            Actually, this topic is kinda relevant, as I'm going to bat in the next few weeks with a TSOY clone (based on ALL the rules of TSOY, just with regular dice and regular numbers... but no specific setting tied to it). I, too, realize that I will have to rewrite whole sections just to put them in "my voice". <br/><br/>Then again, I'm not one known for finishing gaming projects (Hey Ron, I've gotten about 3 pages on that "Coming Soon" Kung-Fu Apocalypse Sorcerer supplement I've been working on since 2002! WooHoo, I'll go make a logo for my gaming company now!)
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MikeRM</cite><br/>1. If you could add just one thing to the rules, what would it be?</blockquote>
... hmmm. More "small examples" (like two for each rules section), rather than the "long sneak-attack example".<br/><br/>More secrets (including more social/willpower themed ones), with some tight organization.<br/><br/>I guess that's two things.
<blockquote>2. If you could remove just one thing, what would it be?</blockquote>
I can't think of anything I'd remove. Everything there is solid, it just needs to be put in "your voice". Maybe change the examples to fit your game world.
<blockquote>3. If you could change just one thing, what would it be?</blockquote>
Hmmm. I think this question is an amalgam of the above two, no?
<blockquote>4. If you could clarify just one rule, which rule would you pick?</blockquote>
BDTP. It needs More Cowbell. And more instructions on how to use it, what it's tactically (and story-wise) good for. Also, I've been in a few various games of TSOY where the GM says something like, "Well, if you want to <i>really</i> defeat this dude here, you have to Bring Down the Pain": Essentially following the rules so that the players and only the players BDTP, but forcing them into it to continue the story; this is a big no-no, and while I get why (basically because its to prevent the GM from making the players focus on something that the GM finds interesting but the rest of the players find boring/uninteresting), it's obvious that others didn't come away with that same impression, so maybe a teensy bit more (like, "a sidebar") would help.<br/><br/>Good luck!<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Mike, as a completely gut-feeling, un-thought-through response:<br/><br/><i>1. If you could add just one thing to the rules, what would it be?</i><br/><br/>I'd like the ability to choose your own dice pools. So, for example, I'd like my priest character to have a "Piety" pool, which is refreshed by a night of prayer. That kind of thing.<br/><br/>Also, as a very personal thing, I'd like a set of LARP rules. I tried to write one once, but it was incredibly difficult.<br/><br/><i>2. If you could remove just one thing, what would it be?</i><br/><br/>I think I might remove the World of Near. My first reaction on reading TSoY was something like "This would be just perfect for Victorian London" (and, of course, other settings sprang to mind too). And of course that works fine, but it does require mentally removing Near and replacing it with your own setting.<br/><br/>(Edit: Bugger. Sorry. I just read your post a little more closely, so perhaps this isn't helpful. Oh well.)<br/><br/><i>3. If you could change just one thing, what would it be?</i><br/><br/>I'd like the option to change the dice to some very, very simple form of randomiser. Coins, perhaps, or cards. Given that each die basically gives a Yes / No / Neutral response, it looks as though there's an opportunity to use something simpler than dice.<br/><br/>I find the text very clearly written, so I'll ignore the last question, if that's OK.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            "Hello, my name is Chris and I'm a TSOY Rewriter, too." &lt;:) <br/><br/>I have an idea brewing for a sword &amp; sorcery setting based on TSOY. I really like TSOY because it can be fast or crunchy and its Secrets and Keys are great Flags for players' interests. Here are some possible changes I'm considering:<br/><br/>* Use real d6 dice, not Fudge dice<br/><br/>* Why have Advances? Why spend 5 XP to buy 1 "Advance"? Why not just spend XP directly? (The downside of spending XP is that players don't get to "keep score" by knowing their XP high-water mark.)<br/><br/>* Some people find assigning and shaking out Harm confusing<br/><br/>* BDTP is confusing, especially the parallel/perpendicular actions<br/><br/>* If Keys are Flags for players' macro/story interests and Secrets are Flags for players' micro/action interests, why not combine Secrets and Keys? Or treat Secrets like mini-Keys, maybe granting 1 XP every time an invoked Secret is used successfully.<br/><br/>* More support for players and GMs creating new Secrets and Keys. Provide more examples of Secret and Key creation/balance. Maybe make Secret and Key phrasing more formulaic (like Mad Libs) to make creation easier?                        </div>

That's in there, Wilhelm! (Ok, I know of what you speak - and it's kind of in there. I give an example with the Secret of Blessing. You can easily do this, just by making your own secret.)<br/><br/>Graham - hey, I ask for this stuff by telling people that they can rewrite whatever they want, but man, seriously, that was kind of harsh (the part about removing the setting.)                        </div>

                            Yes, I'm sorry, that came out completely wrong. <br/><br/>What I meant to say was: having the setting in there tends to disguise the fact that TSoY is actually a very universal rules system. You could use it for a Victorian London detective game or space opera as well as fantasy. I stole part of it for a Meat Loaf LARP.<br/><br/>But, yes, I like the setting and I wouldn't actually <i>want</i> to remove it. It's difficult answering questions like "What would you remove?".<br/><br/>Note to self: don't post at 6am.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            I'm with Graham - my first thought was - tease out the Near stuff and firewall it from the actual mechanisms of play - use it as an example of where the game can go (with custom keys and secrets illustrating this), rather than a default setting integrated into the entire text.  So you get this great engine, then you get this great example of how to employ it to meet your needs.  The very first thing I did was separate the two for myself, because I have never been into playing in a setting somebody else made up for me, <em>especially a setting that takes a liberal view of marijuana use</em>.  I prefer the terrifyingly accurate White Wolf NWOD take on the perils of marijuana.  Seriously, Near is great, but I think it should be its own thing.                        </div>

                            BTW, if anyone's interested, here's the starter notes for the modification I'm working on:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.kitkowski.com/archives/50" rel="nofollow">http://www.kitkowski.com/archives/50</a><br/><br/>Interestingly enough, I'm in favor of changing some of the pools around ('Instinct' is really hard for me and soem other folks to get our heads around in the lond term, as it seems that many of the skills that can be used for the other pools can be used for "Instinct" and vidce versa).  I'm not so sure that "everyone gets their own pools" is going to be constructive in the long term (unless everyone had three common pools and one extra pool would be for Nin<b>j</b>a Magic or Priest Magic or whatever). But kinda like Judd I'm in favor of defining pools for the campaign; 3-5 pools that everyone shares (which the skills are then tied to) which change depending if you're playing a voodoo pirates or Jedi game.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Note: I have played TSOY 1st and 2nd editions. Currently transposing Solar System to a modern private detective/noirish game - in Danish. Well, if it works, no reason why it shouldn't be in English as well. (Oh, Andy, love the Nina Magic, even if it's a spelling mistake <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>)<br/><br/>I think two of the major things that rock in Solar are Secrets and Keys, and here lies also the transposition to other genres and settings. Change them, and BANG you have another game entirely, still based on solid mechanics. The Pools I'm less inclined to change or expand.<br/><br/>1. If you could add just one thing to the rules, what would it be?<br/>More examples, small and big. And I will add an "adventure" in mine as well.<br/><br/>2. If you could remove just one thing, what would it be?<br/>Nothing really.<br/><br/>3. If you could change just one thing, what would it be?<br/>In a perfect world? Use normal dice - but Fudge dice so nicely fit into the system's currency that I actually have come to believe it's not possible without changing this. I've tried. Normal dice are so much more accessible.<br/><br/>4. If you could clarify just one rule, which rule would you pick?<br/>The rule, in my experience, that people don't get is the BDTP, especially the two types of actions. I need a "This is why the BDTP is there, and this is how it works, and it's good for you" kinda description.<br/><br/>Per                        </div>

I know the text is fairly clear on who calls for BTDP and what they get from it, but it gives very little guidance on when you have to roll at all, what can be established through narratation as opposed to needing a die roll to "make it stick," and whether player-characters get any kind of "turns" vs. the GM being able to give one person roll after roll while the others sit and watch.

                            I would not remove the World of Near setting from TSOY (though obviously World of Near would not be appropriate for Errantry). Even if some people use the "Solar System" rules in a different setting, the World of Near is so varied that it provides many good examples of different types of Secrets and Keys.

                            Time for a thread check.<br/><br/>So far I'm encouraged, you're mostly reinforcing what I've already done/what I'm already aiming to do.<br/><br/>Clinton is (of course) right, there is a document (though it's a little hard to find) which is <a href="http://www.anvilwerks.com/src/tsoy2/solar_system.html" rel="nofollow">just the Solar System</a> without the World of Near. It omits Transcendence, as well; I'm not sure whether that's intentional or an oversight. (I'm leaving Transcendence out at the moment, though I may put it in eventually.) That's the main document I based my version on.<br/><br/>My version has many more <a href="http://www.csidemedia.com/wiki/pmwiki.php/Errantry/ListOfSecrets" rel="nofollow">Secrets</a> and quite a few more <a href="http://www.csidemedia.com/wiki/pmwiki.php/Errantry/ListOfExampleAbilities" rel="nofollow">Abilities</a> and <a href="http://www.csidemedia.com/wiki/pmwiki.php/Errantry/ListOfKeys" rel="nofollow">Keys</a> as well (and drops a few that don't fit my setting). I like Chris's suggestion on making them more formulaic and hence easier to imitate; I'm presenting them in tables, not paragraphs (my old technical writing instincts cutting in).<br/><br/>I am planning on turning as much as possible into tables, in fact, including sequences of actions <a href="http://www.csidemedia.com/wiki/files/Action%20Resolution.htm" rel="nofollow">like this</a>, and especially BDTP. With sidebars of examples, thanks, that's a good suggestion from several people.<br/><br/>Maybe lay the whole thing out like a "For Dummies" book (I dislike the title of that series - it's so patronising, and the writing often matches - but the visual layout works well for its purpose).<br/><br/>Harm, shaking out and healing - yes, that needs more words around it and perhaps using tokens on the character sheet instead of ticks/checks (so you can slide them all to the left to shake out the harm).<br/><br/>I've renamed the pools to fit my setting, too, though I'm staying with three of them and they very broadly cover the same territory (Reason is now Artes, which is more supernatural knowledge and ability than intellect, but the other two are more renamed than rethought). I think allowing people to pick their own pools would complicate Abilities, since these are linked to pools.<br/><br/>I came across Rafial's key "powerup" thing on the RandomWiki (basically, it's a tweak to prevent people buying out keys without using them, since it costs 1 Advance/5 XP to get a key but you can then get 10 XP for buying it out). My solution is slightly different: Keys must be "activated" before you can buy them out, and you do this by earning at least 5 XP with them.<br/><br/>What I'm hearing here so far that I haven't yet considered is:<br/><br/>* Replacing Fudge dice with D6s. I'm not sure about this as it would make a big difference to the mechanics/numbers of the system. I'm inclined to agree with Per that it may not fly, but I'll give it more thought.<br/>* Not converting XP into Advances. I agree that this is a simplification but it may be a difficult simplification (if you know what I mean).<br/><br/>I'm adding a couple of mechanics, notably Boons and Obligations. Boons are things you win by beating the characters you encounter in a contest (using BDTP), or convincing them that your quest goal serves their Key. You have to get a certain value in Boons to complete your quest, and narratively this works by using the items/help/information you get as Boons in order to advance towards the goal of your quest.<br/><br/>Obligations are what you get if the encounter character beats you in BDTP - they're like temporary Keys that give you XP when you fulfil them (instead of when you break them).<br/><br/>Oh, and I'm thinking of renaming XP as Renown (or possibly Repute).<br/><br/>So far Boons are in a separate "currency", but I am likely to combine the two.<br/><br/>Thanks for the suggestions so far, keep them coming!<br/><br/>(Edited to add links to Abilities, Secrets and Keys, now tabulated.)                        </div>

Ugh.  Sorry, not a fan.<br/><br/>My group and I played tSoY for the first time last weekend, after me raving about it for over a year.  They liked it so much we're doing character creation next week for an ongoing game.  But the Fudge dice...  Nothing against them, but this is the only game we'll likely be playing that uses them, and none of us are about to get special dice for it.  We just use regular D6's.  A 1-2 is a minus, 3-4 is nothing and 5-6 is a plus.  It seems to be working okay so far, but I like the upthread idea of using a coin for resolution, or reverting to a hard numbers system as in the original version (but without the chart).                        </div>

Mike: I really like your "Obligations". I hadn't thought of giving Keys to other plays (as GM or another player). They may or may not be required to use it, but just <i>having</i> it would be a temptation to use it. Kinda like DitV Fallout that gives you a d4 trait; it seems like a bonus, but it's a temptation to make a risky move.                        </div>

I'll have different settings where the pools are different and are refreshed in different ways, which really reinfornced not only theme but color and vibe at the table.<br/><br/>Keys are a little different in that players can at times give XP to one another, further decentralizing the XP.<br/><br/>And there are other little wiggles with different settings.<br/><br/>It is coming together well.<br/><br/>Hope that is helpful to the thread.                        </div>

                            1. If you could add just one thing to the rules, what would it be?<br/>
<br/>
More cultures. There are a number of fan-created cultures, factions, and races that are very cool. For example, someond did some rule for witchraft that I think are very cool. They can be found on the Wiki, I beleive.<br/>
<br/>
3. If you could change just one thing, what would it be?<br/>
<br/>
I've changed my initial reaction to the setting. At first I thought "I'm not interested in this", but I've found myself pulling out peices of the setting and using them in my own game. For example, I pulled out the Qek culture (which rules), to use as the basis of a race of Jovan man-bats. I'd recommend that anyone looking to adapt the game not gloss over the cultural sections or just mine them for keys. There's a lot of good coolness in the cultures of Near. I'm beginning to understand why Clinton did them the way he did.                        </div>

                            One thought I wanted to add, regarding removing 'advances', and that thought is simply to keep them -- they provide a very nice "*ding*" moment, akin to hitting a new level or the like, and players often enjoy that feeling of hitting a goal of that nature.<br/><br/>I'd be interested to see how folks would do a 'hard numbers system, but without the chart" version of the 1st edition, non-fudge-dice system... interested in a 'that's an odd-looking fish' way, because frankly I love the 1 = 1 = 1 currency that the fudge dice give the system.

                            Another thought I had, and I'd be interested in reactions - what if you went from Fudge dice (+, 0, -) to a binary system without the zero (pluses are even/minuses are odd or pluses are high/minuses are low), using whatever dice you happened to have? Would that help with Andy's observation about some BDTP conflicts dragging on?<br/><br/>Thanks to 1001 Nights for the inspiration (though it may have come there from Prime Time Adventures or even further away for all I know).                        </div>

                            I figured out the mathematical difference (after posting - hey, I'm an arts grad at heart). Three binary dice also give a maximum of +3, a minimum of -3 and a theoretical average of 0, but you never actually get 0, you can only get +/-3 or +/-1. And +/-3 is more than three times as common as with Fudge dice (1/8 for each versus 1/27).<br/><br/>I suspect that I should playtest my other changes with Fudge dice to see what they break, and then try it with binary dice, so I'm not wondering "Was it the underlying idea or was it the change of dice that made that not work?"                        </div>

                            It's interesting. For a while, I tried to do a live-action version of TSoY (many apologies) which used coin tossing. It didn't work, for other reasons, but the binary thing seemed as though it would work well.<br/><br/>Jason, I agree that the increased probability would cause a dramatic difference, but it might still work. An unskilled guy would get a Master result every 27 times: say, every two or three gaming sessions, depending on how dicey your game is. That does require a small downgrading of what a "Master" result means, sure - "My God! That just worked beautifully!" - but it's doable.<br/><br/>One potential problem is that sometimes (e.g. if you roll three dice) there's no way of getting a perfectly neutral result.<br/><br/>I like the card draw thing very much, by the way. But I'd be doing things like giving each player a hand of cards and then giving "drawn" cards to other players. That means that the winning cards go around in a sort of interesting way.<br/><br/>Graham<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Yes, the worst thing about the shift in probabilities to me is that you never actually get a result at your theoretical level if you use 3 binary dice. It's always a bit better, a bit worse, a lot better or a lot worse.                        </div>

                            OK, so I came up with another idea which uses five ordinary d6s and gives the same outcomes as rolling three Fudge dice, though not quite in the same proportions.<br/><br/>Two of the dice have a different appearance (size, colour etc.) from the other three and are the "Gate" dice. Between them they define what is a minus, a zero or a plus on the other three dice you roll.<br/><br/>A minus is any result below the result on the lower Gate die.<br/><br/>A plus is any result above the result on the higher Gate die.<br/><br/>A zero is anything between the two Gate dice (inclusive).<br/><br/>So if you roll, for example, a 2 and a 5 on your Gate dice, 1s are minuses, 2-5 are zeroes and 6s are pluses. If you roll two 4s on the Gate dice, 1-3 is a minus, 4 is a zero, 5-6 is a plus.<br/><br/>This gives about 50% zeroes (actually about 49%), rather than the 1/3 that Fudge dice give. You can make it almost even if you do a lot of fiddly stuff with "1s and 2s are minuses when they match the low die, 5s and 6s are pluses when they match the high die", but it would be easier then just to say "1-2 is minus, 3-4 is zero, 5-6 is plus" and be done with it.<br/><br/>I don't know if Gate dice are a useful idea in themselves but they gave me another thought. How about you have two numbers which are "pillars", and they move according to events in the game? If you roll under the low one it's a minus, above the high one it's a plus, in between it's a zero. A bit like the Trollbabe Number idea but with two numbers instead of one.<br/><br/>If you made them black and white and called them Jakin and Boaz you could use them in a Masonic-themed game, for example.                        </div>

                            OK, I came up with what may be a sensible way of using this for the Solar System. I think it simplifies the die mechanics, but you'd have to try it out and see.<br/><br/>You have an "injury level" and a "fatigue level". They begin at 1; 1 is good.<br/><br/>Harm increases injury - your injury level is your highest current "harm" level. It affects all three pools for 1-3 harm, but only the specific pool for 4-6 harm (as per basic Solar System). When harm "shakes out" at the end of Bringing Down the Pain, your injury level will probably drop accordingly.<br/><br/>Spending pool points increases fatigue. Each pool point <i>below</i> your maximum increases your fatigue by 1. This is always pool-specific, and operates regardless of what your maximum is.<br/><br/>On each task resolution, you roll 3d6 (or more if you have bonus/penalty dice applicable).<br/><br/>Any die result that is below both your Injury and your Fatigue (for the pool of the related ability) gives you -1 to your skill.<br/><br/>Any die result lying between Injury and Fatigue (inclusive) has no effect (0).<br/><br/>Any die result that is above both Injury and Fatigue gives +1.<br/><br/>You don't receive penalty dice for harm.<br/><br/>On the one hand, this increases the consequences of spending pool points considerably. On the other hand, it reduces the number of penalty dice in use, and increases the number of times that the dice rolled give zeroes and so have no effect on the success level - that is, your success level is your ability level. (The average result over the long term is always zero in any case.)                        </div>
