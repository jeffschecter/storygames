How about Costume Drama with Superheroes? or a Zombie Movie with Supernatural Horror elements?<br/>It's GMless, it takes about 2 and a half hours to play, and it's completely zero-prep.<br/>It plays a little like Fiasco, though it was originally inspired by Dogs In the Vineyard and Cuthulhu Dark - I don't think you'd really recognize those influences anymore, though.<br/><br/>So, if I may, your thoughts:<br/><br/>Does the game appeal to you?<br/>Does it strike you as something different?<br/>Are the rules easy to understand?<br/><br/>If anybody plays it, I'd frickin' love to hear about your game!<br/><br/>Hope this is something interesting for you!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410825/#Comment_410825" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-30T06:03:36+00:00" title="March 30, 2013  6:03AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 30, 2013 6:25AM by Graham.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a really slick rules presentation: one of the best I've seen.

I notice that the cards feature People, Places and Things but not many Events. For new/shy players, Events might drive the story forward more than simply introducing someone or something new. In all honesty, I would probable do some "house-ruling".

At first I was going to recommend making them larger to include more space for notes but then I thought a better idea might be to make them Avery label format, and reformatting them landscape so you can stick them at the top of an index card (if you don't have labels, print them on paper and get out the Pritt Stick - you could call this the Blue Peter round...).<br/><br/>Speaking as a boardgame veteran used to such terminology, for me it would be more clear if you said the game had three <i>phases</i> - character, story and epilogue - each of which has one or more rounds. The character "round" actually includes 3 rounds (ie complete sweeps around the table) - introduction, flashback and goal - and I struggled to make sense of the rules as written (this might be my own baggage, but I think games have developed more detailed breakdowns like that for good reasons).<br/><br/>Am I right in thinking that the cards you deal out at the start are the only cards used in the game? And that at the start of each story round, all the cards are shuffled and put into a pile? It isn't clear to me.<br/><br/>Turn order: it's always fun to have a silly rule at the start to say who should go first. I guess you've already considered how always going clockwise will tend to create one type of story as opposed to mixing it up each time. Either way, I think you should make turn order more explicit in the text.<br/><br/>Finally, I think you could do worse than to include a short list of things you can/are encouraged to do, eg. DO incorporate other player's characters, their flashbacks, etc. Otherwise, I think there's a risk that n00b players will start telling parallel stories and come unstuck.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Edmoo" title="Edmoo"><img alt="Edmoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Edmoo">Edmoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410912/#Comment_410912" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-31T07:11:15+00:00" title="March 31, 2013  7:11AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham: Thanks man, that's all dead positive! I've got plans to make some improvements to the rules video - just to ensure that it's INCREDIBLY clear how to play - but when I've got it right, I think it'll be an excellent way to put it across. I hope we get a chance to play sometime.<br/><br/>BiffBoff on Event Cards: Yeah, events is a great idea! There was a time in the game's development when the cards had events on them, but at the time it clashed with other rules - since then, however, events is totally feasible, and you're right, it's more accessible to the new player, which is Screenplay's mission statement.<br/><br/>BiffBoff on House Rules: What's the idea behind the dialogue cards? Sounds like a cool mechanic, just wondering what you think it would add. Is there something missing?<br/><br/>James on Avery Format: Interesting idea here. The game actually works fine if you just print the cards on paper - they'll easily be hardy enough. Perhaps it's worth making this clear, as people feeling they need card could be a barrier to play. In terms of landscape layout, I think it's pretty much an aesthetic matter. I might try trialing a landscape card set and see if it improves things.<br/><br/>James on Terminology: Damn you for making a brilliant point that would require re-shooting video :P. They totally should be called Phases - I don't know why I didn't see that. I'll take a look at how much effort that would be to revise.<br/><br/>James on Card Dealing: Cards are dealt at the start of the game, then never again. Does this ambiguity fail to come across in the video, or was it unclear in the text as well? Either way I'll fix it, I just want to know exactly what to fix. I'm planning to put some shots of the table-layout into the rules video - I think that might make everything clearer.<br/><br/>James on Turn Order: A lovely suggestion, I'll implement it pronto!<br/><br/>James on Play Advice: I've already written a list of good play skills and some notes on them, I just couldn't find where to fit them on the site.

Rules should be explained verbally in my opinion. The number of cards made me a little confused until I read the rules in text, because I first thought each player had their own cards.<br/><br/>The rules seems easy and I would gladly try them some time, but you say that it takes 2-3 hours to play this while I think it would take me a little more than an hour, including presentation of the rules. With seven scenes each (3 presentation rounds, 3 scenes, 1 epilogue), a game of five players would give each scene a two minute span. I got the feeling from the videos that presentation and playing out the scene is rather short. What is it that takes up the most time when you play the game?<br/><br/>I would actually like to have a ... not a full game, but an AP where the audience follows one story while you explain the rules as you go. This would give a better feel of how to play things out. Lets say that the video starts with four people around the table. It continues with you explaining the idea of the game and introducing the theme for this particular session. You lay out the cards while explaining why there are seven of them. Then cut to the presentation phase, go through each round with one player, pointing out the rules and that other players are taking their turn during the round before you move on. And so on. In the story phase, introduce more and more examples as you go, like that any other player may feel free to involve other characters in the story. Don't explain everything during the first round in the story phase.<br/><br/>This would give me a clearer view of how to play your game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Edmoo" title="Edmoo"><img alt="Edmoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Edmoo">Edmoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411160/#Comment_411160" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-03T02:23:54+00:00" title="April  3, 2013  2:23AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Rickard!<br/>I've been living in Liverpool for university, but I'm actually from Yorkshire. My accent is closer to a southern English accent than northern, though, for no apparent reason <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>.<br/><br/>The bulk of the game takes place in the Story Phase. In each player's turn, they begin the scene, then two other players each add a section of narration to end it. The epilogue and character rounds are relatively quick - but the story rounds take a longer.<br/>The game does run exceptionally quick though - it often runs at just over 2 hours, though it feels like a pretty full and intense roleplaying session.<br/><br/>I like your idea for the video a lot - I've come to the conclusion that the new video will need to show the game being played more - and you're plan is a lovely way of doing that. I'll be filming the new video tomorrow!<br/><br/>Cheers!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
