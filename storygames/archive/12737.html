Do the players get both?<br/><br/>Do Conditions have any mechanical effect?<br/><br/>Now I can't find where in the text this question arose, but I wrote down "How do you lose the use of a secret?".<br/><br/>thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steffen" title="Steffen"><img alt="Steffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steffen">Steffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286404/#Comment_286404" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-15T07:10:19+00:00" title="August 15, 2010  7:10AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Conditions do not have any direct mechanical effect.

We had a good adventure and a really great time, despite all being new to the game. <br/><br/>There was probably a bit too much piloting (says the guy who played Snargle). I felt like I was hogging the spotlight a little, but situations kept playing to my particular strengths. Conversely, the player running Naomi had a little less to do. I think for fewer players (we had three) it might be smart to take the lesser magic out of the engineer's sheet and give that character a bit more "kick ass," then taking Naomi out as an option. But keep in mind that this is just from one experience. In another game Snargle might have been irrelevant and Naomi hogged up all the action. <br/><br/>I liked the way the pool worked. I was afraid it would be a circle-jerk in the way FATE can sometimes be. In other words, I don't like systems were I use a resource to be awesome and then get that resource back for being awesome. But it worked just the opposite since getting back pool dice was tied to failure. So you could either be awesome but lose resources, or fail and gain resources. Very cool.<br/><br/>I don't know if the system would be satisfying for more than three sessions, but it might be. We didn't buy off any keys, for instance, which could really make one feel the character evolving. <br/><br/>Starting out in the brig confounded me for a moment until I decided Snargle would begin loudly complaining about how the Imperials were treating a citizen of the free worlds! So I used politics to get us out of the brig. How did others of you have played or run the game get out?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287357/#Comment_287357" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T17:41:27+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  5:41PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my PbF game, Snargle annoyed the guards until they got close to the bars of his cell to beat him, then beat the crap out of them with Goblin-Fu.  There seems to be a certain reciprocal tension between Naomi and the Owl's crew for who will be the dramatic center of the game, wacky smuggler hijinks or revenge and princesses and stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
