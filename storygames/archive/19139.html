While there have been some cool discussions on it, I think Praxis: Game Design ( <a href="http://www.story-games.com/praxis/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/praxis/</a> ) has reached the end of its lifecycle. There are some great resources and tools out there for building communities around game design (I've seen G+ communities work really well in a lot of different circumstances), and so I recommend those. <br/><br/>That said: if you are thinking: "James, what are you doing, game design forums are awesome and I could totally run one." then you should totally create one, and I will totally help you get the word out about it, and help point people there.<br/><br/>Current plan is that I'm going to turn the lights off in about a month, after taking one last database backup.

History time.<br/><br/>So, Praxis was meant to be a place to discuss this: "The ground-upwards creation of new games". So, if you were looking for a place to, say, post an ongoing journal of your new design's progress, or you wanted to suss out basic ideas about your game, it was what Praxis was made for.<br/><br/>"Make Stuff!" has always been the creation of materials (words or products) for existing games or tabletop experiences. Frex, "Achievement Cards for Any RPG", "New Moves for Hardholders", "Alternate Armor rules for D&amp;D", etc.<br/>"Game Design Help" was basically for nudges in the direction to completion. The idea is that if you didn't have at least a draft of your game, Praxis was the better place for that. But if you did have a draft or solid framework, and you were looking for an exacting, specific piece of advice or help somewhere, Game Design Help was for that. Ex "I have these new elves, and they are like this: (3 paragraphs of text). But I would like to add an etherial/magical ability. I have these three ideas. Which one sounds best?" or "I'm designing an adventure generator, but need another way to say X. Ideas?"<br/><br/>The reason is this: For about 2 years or so, posters would regularly post RPG design stuff, anything from "help me with this specific idea" to "Hey guys what do you think of this general game idea?" posts. Which was okay then, because it was about maybe 1/20th of the normal traffic, and didn't get in the way of the core competency of the site: Discussing Play, News, Games, Techniques. <br/><br/>When the Forge closed up shop for idle RPG discussion, we got a FLOOD of general game design discussion. Overnight, we went from 1/10th to 1/20th of the threads being about "Hey guys look at my new game design idea!" to 1/2 or more of the discussions being that. From new posters, who hadn't participated in the community, nor did they continue to participate in the community outside their bloggy game-discussion-live post. We went from applicant messages of "Hey, I want to talk about Dogs in the Vineyard" or "I heard about Game X" or "I saw Y's post on another forum and wanted to see more" (about 10-20 applicants a week), to nearly Every New Applicant joining with the message, "I'm working on a new RPG and want feedback". Not kidding when I say out of 10 new applicants, 9 of them would have that exact message or something nearly like it.<br/><br/>There was a real risk of S-G turning into The Forge's Runoff/Garbage Dump. The board was flooded with new people who had no interest in doing anything more than talking about their own game ideas without contributing much else. Praxis was an admittedly imperfect step to channel that to another area, so that S-G could remain a place to talk about Play, News, Games and Techniques. Still, it was something. For many months I too was an active participant. <br/><br/>So, that's sort of the origin story of Praxis: It started as a way to bail out S-G from being overrun with a horde of otherwise well-meaning people who heard somewhere, "Since the Forge closed its general game design forum, you can now just go to S-G and talk about your game design there!". <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">@Johnstone</a> - Unfortunately it couldn't work; the databases too unwieldy, it's now its own archive.

If someone has made a join request that hasn't been approved in a reasonable timeframe they should contact <a href="https://plus.google.com/+DanMaruschak" rel="nofollow">me</a> so we can resolve the situation. Right now I don't have any join requests pending, but human error in the approval process or G+ being weird are always possibilities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
