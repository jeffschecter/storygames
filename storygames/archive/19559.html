By putting narrative power into a rotating system?<br/><br/>Basically, what does the game do? And how does it do things differently? Like, what's the pitch?</blockquote>\nWell it's a cooperative story game. The players, or player narrators as they are called in the game, build the setting for the story they will be creating, they "vote" on the outcomes of various actions by adding coloured beads to the "challenge bag", and they are expected to voice their ideas or how the story might progress or what might happen in a particular scene. I wouldn't call it cinematic, but I wouldn't call it gritty or realistic either. The setting is low fantasy and the characters are for the most part pretty normal people. The game doesn't worry too much  about the characters' abilities. When a character succeeds at something its a matter luck and how the players voted. Abilities are pure flavour, a handy reminder as to how you might describe why your character failed or succeeded. As such it works best when characters have both strengths and weaknesses.<br/><br/>At the forefront of the game are the character's virtues. These are kind of like the emotional drive or motivation that guides the characters actions. When your character is faced with a problem, why he would choose to deal with it in a particular way is more important than how he does it. The how can be narrated after the action has been resolved. By choosing to have your character to be guided by a virtue such as anger, resentment or concern, you are telling the other players what has motivated your character's action. If the motives ring true to them and if your success will make the story more interesting, they'll vote in your favour. The other side of virtues is that they give you points which you can spend on drawing more beads after the other players have voted. Depending on how you made your character, some virtues will give you more points than others. The more beads you draw the more choices you have. You might be given the choice of success with a negative outcome or failure with a positive outcome, to name only two of the four possible results. In my own experience, people are not shy of choosing failure or negative outcomes. Things tend to get more interesting when things become messier and more complicated for the characters.<br/><br/>I wouldn't call it a cut-throat game of stakes-setting. It's definitely character driven, but its not melodramatic as I understand the term. There's a kind of psychological darkness to the game and I think that can be attributed to the setting, the game's focus on inner motives, the normality of the characters, and the impossible task ahead of them. I guess that there's a kind of tragic hopelessness to what the characters have to do, but there's often been elements of comedy in the sessions I have played. I'm not sure why this is. Maybe it had something to do with me or the groups I played with. But I do know that the those moments didn't contradict the feel of the game. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434800/#Comment_434800" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-03T12:42:42+00:00" title="July  3, 2014 12:42PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2014 12:47PM by Rickard.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> I think those are valid questions; they're basically "what's the pitch" divided into three parts.</blockquote>\nYeah, that was my intention with the questions. The game sounds interesting, but it doesn't hook me. The three questions I asked are the WHY, HOW, WHAT that I talked about <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/post/quote/18733/Comment_433056" rel="nofollow">in another thread</a>. When I mentioned these three on another forum, one person thought of The Big Three:\n<blockquote>* What's your game about? (WHY)<br/>* What do the characters do? (WHAT)<br/>* What do the players do? (HOW)</blockquote>\nI would say that my three questions are better directed, because the first question in The Big Three could render an answer like "It's about elves and dwarves and weapons" (=WHATs), when it should IMHO be about what makes the game interesting for anyone\u2014about WHY anyone would like to play that game.<br/><br/>The first one of my questions is answered in a way, over at the blog, that I have to guess what kind of feelings I get when I'm allowed to "...influence how the game progresses " and "... playing your character true their personality, by allowing their inner motives to direct the choices they make,". To make me guess doesn't really give me any satisfaction.\n<blockquote>1. What kind of experience do we get from playing your game?<br/>2. How do your game achieve that?<br/>3. What is the unique bit in your game?</blockquote><blockquote>CHESS<br/>This game is for you who likes to think ahead and enjoy the thrill of beating an opponent (1st question-WHY). Do smart maneuvers (HOW) by taking turns moving (2nd-HOW) pieces on a board (WHAT), where the possibilities of the outcome is almost limitless (3rd-WHAT).</blockquote>\nThat's a sales pitch. Yes, it's subjective but it's what I will use when I read your game. I will judge how well your WHY fits the game, I will have a starting knowledge about HOW to play your game, and I will look out for WHAT the game uses. I can confess that I'm bored with most concepts out there, and always seeking new ideas or applications, so the third question is based on that. So don't worry if your game isn't using anything unique, because it shouldn't be a general rule in designing games (I'm stealing most of my stuff, as an example).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham" title="MJGraham"><img alt="MJGraham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nEPVXFCEJAK2O.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham">MJGraham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434801/#Comment_434801" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-03T12:53:40+00:00" title="July  3, 2014 12:53PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, Rickard.

There is nothing wrong with that, and I found it appealing, but is this an intention of your or is it just me interpreting the text wrong?\n<blockquote> I guess that there's a kind of tragic hopelessness to what the characters have to do, but there's often been elements of comedy in the sessions I have played. I'm not sure why this is. Maybe it had something to do with me or the groups I played with.</blockquote>\nMy guess is that it's a combination of a defense mechanism and a roller coaster balance. The defense mechanism is about using jokes to distance yourself from the tragic, and you can see a roller coaster balance in a stand-up act. If someone is equally funny for 30 minutes, you will constantly raise your bar and be bored toward the end, even if it's the funniest thing you've ever seen. To balance this out, a stand-up comedian (according to my analyze anyway) got low moments inbetween the jokes, to balance out the peaks. You got the same thing in theater where you got a low point, build-up, climax, and finally aftereffects. Some say that this is a three act structure, but it's just wrong. You got a constant roller coaster balance of high and low points, because if the show would climax all the time, people would get used to it and raise the bar for what's interesting. TV series uses the same formula.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434808/#Comment_434808" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-03T14:43:34+00:00" title="July  3, 2014  2:43PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an interesting pitch, I'll check out that website.

It's a game of pure strategy, where two opponents try to out-think each other, and the player with the best ability to strategize and think a step ahead of his adversary will win. An intense intellectual competition, with no distractions, from as close to a perfectly level battleground as possible.<br/><br/>While it theoretically could be said to represent a battle between two nations, the game is abstract in nature - no outside knowledge (about, e.g. battles or political history) would influence gameplay.<br/><br/>Study of the game itself, however, is deep and rewarding, giving the player a potential advantage over her opponents.<br/><br/>Most people play the game with intense concentration, deliberating over each move.<br/><br/>2. There is no random element to gameplay; each player takes a single turn moving a piece on the board. A set of sixteen pieces per player governed by simple rules about movement give rise to a huge variety of positions and strategies. While the rules are simple, the emergent strategies (particularly long-term strategies) are many. Players can develop additional strategies by studying others' play, opening variations, and so forth.<br/><br/>There are no possibilities for deceit, bluffing, or negotiation built into the game, so the action takes place purely as an intellectual and strategic challenge.<br/><br/>3. (This is impossible to answer without looking at the historical context of the game, I think. But I'll take a wild guess as to what elements of the game may have been unusual at the time...) <br/><br/>The game is played on a white-and-black board of alternating squares, with each piece having its own available moves. To win the game, one must isolate and trap the opponent's "King" (which means the game may end well before you have removed your opponent's pieces from the board, even if her pieces outnumber yours).<br/><br/>The self-sacrificing nature and limited movement of the "Pawns" has suggestive connotations about the nature of tiered society.<br/><br/>The most powerful piece on the board is the "Queen" (especially compared to the impotent and cowardly "King") lending the game post-modern feminist credentials. :P<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434823/#Comment_434823" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-04T00:20:32+00:00" title="July  4, 2014 12:20AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do think that it matters if you're talking about relaxed, no-clock chess with your friends, tournament, timed chess with an hour per player per game, or speed chess with strangers on the corner for five bucks.<br/><br/>Buuuut, the image of chess outside chess is so weird anyway, there's no need for me to quibble.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham" title="MJGraham"><img alt="MJGraham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nEPVXFCEJAK2O.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham">MJGraham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434827/#Comment_434827" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-04T06:01:53+00:00" title="July  4, 2014  6:01AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 4, 2014 6:02AM by MJGraham.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The first one of my questions is answered in a way, over at the blog, that I have to guess what kind of feelings I get when I'm allowed to "...influence how the game progresses " and "... playing your character true their personality, by allowing their inner motives to direct the choices they make,". To make me guess doesn't really give me any satisfaction.</blockquote>\nI'm not sure I could pinpoint a single particular emotion to the experience of influencing how the game progresses. I guess it's kind of like gaining a greater degree of narrative control while still maintaining an element of unpredictability. I suppose that can be satisfying for some people. <br/><br/>You're very much working with the other players to make the most enjoyable story possible given everyone's expectations. That means that players will negotiate and share ideas. That is to say, narrative control is distributed, not always equally, but it is distributed. I think this spreads the burdens and pleasures of creating a story among the players. There is very much a feeling of this is our story, we're creating it together. We can't say for certain what will happen, but however it turns out, we will all have played a part in its creation.<br/><br/>I believe the game achieves this by keeping the plot character-driven while at the same time not expecting immersion. You can imagine imagine how your character would react and see the possible consequences of his action without imagining that you are your character. When you "vote" on a possible outcome for an action, you're trying to nudge the story in a particular direction, but so are the other players. Sometimes you agree and sometimes you don't. It's only when the player facing a challenge draws some beads that your table see how the "vote" went. When the player who made the draw is able to interpret the result of the draw, he gains more narrative control. He is no longer at the complete whim of how the "vote" went. He still has to abide by the draw, but there's more leeway in determining what the draw means. It's a bit like rolling  one d6 or rolling two d6s and choosing the result on one die. In both cases, the dice determine what can count as a result, but in the latter you can choose between results. Your choices are restricted in both cases, but there less restricted in the second one.<br/><br/>Okay, I'll try say more later.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434828/#Comment_434828" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-04T06:32:32+00:00" title="July  4, 2014  6:32AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 4, 2014 6:32AM by Rickard.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you actually said what I wanted to know, from my questions, in your previous post. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham" title="MJGraham"><img alt="MJGraham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nEPVXFCEJAK2O.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham">MJGraham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434835/#Comment_434835" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-04T09:24:48+00:00" title="July  4, 2014  9:24AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 4, 2014 9:26AM by MJGraham.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I think you actually said what I wanted to know, from my questions, in your previous post. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>\nI thought that maybe I hadn't answered them completely. I'm glad that I was wrong.\n<blockquote><blockquote>In my own experience, people are not shy of choosing failure or negative outcomes. Things tend to get more interesting when things become messier and more complicated for the characters.</blockquote>\nWhen I read this, I sense that that it can be a contradiction between "players as actors" and "players as authors", where the player's goal can contradict the characters. There is nothing wrong with that, and I found it appealing, but is this an intention of your or is it just me interpreting the text wrong?</blockquote>\nThat was an intention of how the game was designed. I wanted it to be character-driven, but I wanted the story to be more important than immersion.\n<blockquote><blockquote> I guess that there's a kind of tragic hopelessness to what the characters have to do, but there's often been elements of comedy in the sessions I have played. I'm not sure why this is. Maybe it had something to do with me or the groups I played with.</blockquote>\nMy guess is that it's a combination of a defense mechanism and a roller coaster balance. The defense mechanism is about using jokes to distance yourself from the tragic, and you can see a roller coaster balance in a stand-up act. If someone is equally funny for 30 minutes, you will constantly raise your bar and be bored toward the end, even if it's the funniest thing you've ever seen. To balance this out, a stand-up comedian (according to my analyze anyway) got low moments inbetween the jokes, to balance out the peaks. You got the same thing in theater where you got a low point, build-up, climax, and finally aftereffects. Some say that this is a three act structure, but it's just wrong. You got a constant roller coaster balance of high and low points, because if the show would climax all the time, people would get used to it and raise the bar for what's interesting. TV series uses the same formula.</blockquote>\nThat makes sense to me. I think you're probably right. I've seen comedians do exactly what you just said, and those that do it tend to be funnier in my opinion.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham" title="MJGraham"><img alt="MJGraham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nEPVXFCEJAK2O.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham">MJGraham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434836/#Comment_434836" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-04T09:27:07+00:00" title="July  4, 2014  9:27AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>That's an interesting pitch, I'll check out that website.
