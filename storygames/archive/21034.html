I'm a language worker/professional, you see.  I know that there are RPG communities all over the non-English speaking world, and of course there are designers on this board whose first language isn't English.  I'd be very interested in a discussion of non-English languages, language facts, linguistic ideologies, etc. in role-playing game play, and design.  Whether it's about translating or working with translators, adaptation, or anything else that's language-related: barriers to entry, linguistic-related design challenges, finding a space for your non-English game in the market-place, or any other anecdotes about language use, I'd be thankful if people would share their stories and their thoughts about RPGs and non-English languages.  <br/><br/>I will start things off with a few questions:<br/><br/>Sandra, without being too nosy, might I ask what local-language you are writing about RPG theory in?  Is it you first language? Have you had to develop a glossary to allow the discussion to proceed?  Or were the other discussants also role-players as well?  I'm interested about how you've built a framework for understanding.  RPG game design is loaded with a lot of domain specific terminology (especially since the Forge).

It's my mom's first language which my father speaks very brokenly. I guess this unnamed language is as close to I'll get to an L-1. I didn't learn English until I was ten and I can't speak my father's native language.\n<blockquote>Have you had to develop a glossary to allow the discussion to proceed?

I was lucky to get some exposure to French games 20 to 15 years ago, mostly designed by Croc, like <i>Bloodlust</i> (brutal, balls-to-the-wall Sword &amp; Sorcery), <i>In Nomine Satanis/Magna Veritas</i> (which inspired SJ's <i>In Nomine</i>), <i>Miles Christi</i> (you're part of a community of Templar Knights in the Levant, each Brother having a role in the monastery, and uses cards instead of dice)...<br/><br/>Tons of good stuff that never got across the language barrier. Such a pity. Some of these games would easily have been cherished classics outside of France if they had been published in English.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461587/#Comment_461587" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-02T14:02:04+00:00" title="April  2, 2017  2:02PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, the situation in Finnish is similar (although obviously less fruitful, being a smaller language area). I count about half a dozen Finnish rpgs that have international relevance, yet have never been translated.<br/><br/>One wonders: if there is about one international-quality game in existence per million non-English people in countries that have had a rpg culture since the last century, does that mean that there are like 500 relevant games out there, untranslated? That's about as many "international quality" games as there are in English, if not more. Quirky thought, even as the English games are obviously more historically important due to having been more accessible and therefore more influential worldwide.<br/><br/>I wouldn't be surprised if the Finnish numbers are skewed somewhat over the average, though; roleplaying is relatively popular here, it may be that we punch a little bit above our demographical weight class in the rpg arts. Still, we may nevertheless be talking of several hundred worthwhile games that even the more scholarly of us have never studied.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Perry" title="Peter_Perry"><img alt="Peter_Perry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Perry">Peter_Perry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461588/#Comment_461588" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-02T16:24:35+00:00" title="April  2, 2017  4:24PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 2, 2017 4:27PM by Peter_Perry.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I wouldn't be surprised if the Finnish numbers are skewed somewhat over the average, though; roleplaying is relatively popular here, it may be that we punch a little bit above our demographical weight class in the rpg arts. </blockquote>\nI think here in Finland we do produce an above average number of RPGs, either with international projection or for internal consumption. And a few have been published in English or translated, with some decent success. How many German or Spanish games have been translated or directly published in English? Can't think of many, and nevertheless those countries have huge populations compared with us. I have the impression that, per capita, we still produce more. Dunno, maybe I'm wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461669/#Comment_461669" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-04T16:00:04+00:00" title="April  4, 2017  4:00PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            English and some british games get translations into spanish usually after many years of their original launch, though the local communities consume the original products in their native language.

I am Czech and there are multiple Czech and Slovak (Czech and Slovak are mutually intelligible and we understand each other without difficulty, so both countries create sort of one pool of gamers, also communities are intertwined) discussion servers focused on RPGs, not mentioning discussions on FB and other media. There is solid market for RPGs and a lot of Czech and Slovak releplaying games (very few if any at all are translated into English, my <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19089/the-few-game-about-battle-of-britain" rel="nofollow">The Few</a> is one of the exceptions). Same goes for Poland (Polish is Slavic language, so I can understand it to a degree and I took interest in few Polish RPGs before), where there are again multiple discussion servers and a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_role-playing_games" rel="nofollow">RPGs in Polish</a>. In Germany, where I live now, it goes without saying - that is a huge market (between 90 and 100 million native speakers) and there are a lot of RPG discussions and really interesting games that are available only in German. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTCARC91yyw" rel="nofollow">DeGenesis</a> is an example of stunning German RPG that was also translated in English.<br/> <br/>About Eastern Europe - as far as I know, there was a big boom for RPGs in Russia like five years ago and there were serious considerations about translating RPGs for the growing Russian market. But Crimean crisis and trade embargos put mostly stop on these activities. Not sure how is situation right now, maybe someone here knows better.<br/>\n<blockquote>(I cast fireball against the orc!)</blockquote>\nLet's do this!

Words that people will get even if they haven't heard the word before.
