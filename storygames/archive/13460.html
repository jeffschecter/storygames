It posits that people often keep loosely to 'scripts'. So, if you're going on a date, you might use the "dinner-and-a-movie" script, which acts like a basic framework. Using the script means that you don't need to negotiate every detail with others; you just do the thing, improvising the details. In the theory, we use scripts all the damn time; vast swathes of our everyday lives are managed by a relatively small number of scripts that we either learned or built up over time.<br/><br/>So, maybe this is especially true, maybe it's less true. Whatever. But hold that thought.<br/><br/>Now, consider "standard marching order" and "standard camp setup" in RPGs that have adventures like that. Those are, well, something akin to the same subject. But we only use them in limited ways, as gamers. Would it be useful to have the players sit down and drum up the scripts for other stuff that "happens off camera"?<br/><br/>Equally, on the front that reads 'social mechanics', imagine telling your players that the Great Chamalun Ceremonial Gathering (or whatever) has a script - a list of what happens when and how, that isn't written down anywhere. Their social rolls will be used to gauge how much of the script they can follow, at low levels, and how much they can change it for everyone at high levels. A social master can lead a group through a unique Tea Ceremony that has novel overtones, without missing a beat or dropping a slacker. Which might be helpful to players navigating the Empire of the Petal Throne... But might also come off as stilted and rigid (Which might mean it would sing in your High Victorian game - but not your Frontier Badass game).<br/><br/>Or the things could get combined in group worldbuilding. Or handed out to players whose character would know them. Or whatever.<br/><br/>Anyway, there's this thing. It keeps coming up, in my head.

So, if you're into reading accessible philosophy books, then you might want to check it out. Though I don't agree with Velleman in a number of key ways, it's a thought provoking book and one pretty relevant to our hobby in interesting ways.<br/><br/>(Note: if you're allergic to contemporary Kantian morality, skip the last couple of chapters.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303634/#Comment_303634" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-07T22:36:23+00:00" title="December  7, 2010 10:36PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds related to "instincts" or whatever they're called in Burning Empires.

Cam's "six-stage procedure", totally.  I'd hesitate to call either a ritual, except in some very technical form of the word.<br/><br/>"Dinner and a Movie", too.  We don't have lines at the end of the "Dinner and a Movie" script, but we do know about the Goodnight Kiss scene, right?  And, I suspect, some have actually walked through that script in life.<br/><br/>On the other hand, codifying them just as if they were rituals might be exactly the ticket to making them useable in a game.

Better than procedure, actually, because it implies more flexibility (I have a cleaning routine that I do in whatever order makes sense on the day; I have a shower cleaning procedure to clean from top to bottom, so as not to "re-clean" stuff due to rinsed-off dirt).<br/><br/>Heh... it was just supposed to be marginalia, not the "semantic core" of the thread. But now were on it, there is a spectrum of "prescriptions about structured activity" that ranges through:<br/>Script - precise<br/>Ritual - less precise, often flexible in terms of timing and performance elements<br/>Procedure - a sequence of activities which may sometimes be juggled or contain irrelevancies for a specific application<br/>Routine - an "unordered list"; stuff that gets done, in no particular order, but STILL with a "formal" start and finish<br/>Activity - intentional plan to do Something, but no inherent timing, sequence, or even rules<br/><br/>Anyhow... I didn't want to derail; which is why I tried to speak more on-point. There's a ton to unpack around "social [script | ritual | procedure | routine] as you bring it into the thread. I found myself thinking of old Traveller character creation, with its tables that lead to more tables (that could lead to a dead PC before finishing chargen!). I likewise thought of DitV's initial challenge that's part of character creation--it's formalized in chargen but there's NOTHING specific about what it should be about (it's just a way to  "force" a tutorial on the basic conflict res system--another procedure). Then I thought of DitV Ceremony--clearly ritual, and as clearly very flexible (within the constraints of the system's rules). Which made me think of the old phrase "the dating ritual"... "marriage ceremonies"... "after-work routines"... you get the idea. CLOSELY related terms, but the connotations/distinctions are everything, both in terms of comprehension in communications AND in terms of how they'd be applied in RPGs, specifically.<br/><br/>NOT threadjacking... just hoping less vague terms would lead to more germane ideas for application.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303699/#Comment_303699" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-08T13:00:34+00:00" title="December  8, 2010  1:00PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Levi Kornelsen</cite>So, these were<i>actual</i>scripts, like, with lines?</blockquote>\nYep!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_303722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303722/#Comment_303722" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-08T15:59:34+00:00" title="December  8, 2010  3:59PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 8, 2010 4:00PM by TomasHVM.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: CamBanks</cite>I would love a whole book or chapter of these things.</blockquote>So would I.

What do you think you'll *do* with it?<br/><br/>The characters are in the process of learning what scripts the aliens in the planet the humans come to colonize use for..everything! The concept would be great to help players have a sense of what they are looking for, and also, once one is established, that would help the world feel more concrete and ordered. <br/><br/>There could also be method "scripts" that Earth gives the colonists to follow, eg "When making first contact be sure to use non-threatening body language, etc." Or, the colonists could be responsible for sending social scripts back to Earth. Which could be quite funny. <br/><br/>The other level it could be useful is giving the players a sense of what the rhythm should be in the game, since there's no single gm, but it's not a turn based game. A structure from which to improvise might be a good way to look at how they'll be ordering their play.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><cite>Posted By: CamBanks</cite>I would love a whole book or chapter of these things.</blockquote>So would I.

Having character background and story to work off of is a lot easier and, perhaps, leads to richer story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_303761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303761/#Comment_303761" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-09T03:30:50+00:00" title="December  9, 2010  3:30AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Emily Care</cite>The characters are in the process of learning what scripts the aliens in the planet the humans come to colonize use for..everything!</blockquote>I really like that one! Makes me ponder the possibilities of writing up such 'social scripts' for the various races in my fantasy-world; the man-eating trolls, the black orcs, the mystic gnomes ... and of course; the intelligent big-birds. <br/><br/>I believe GM's would find that very helpful ... and that it would do much for improving the interaction between player characters and non-player characters. Good stuff, this!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
