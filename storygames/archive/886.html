                    Seeing the number of comments on my post on <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=873&amp;page=1#Item_19" rel="nofollow">chaotic play</a> that were clogging up Andy's <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=873" rel="nofollow">"Reveal Your Current Game Ideas!" Thread: Summer</a>, I figured I'd take it here.  Andy's not asked us to yet, but if I gave into the temptation to start discussing it there, well...  Anyway, I've got some thoughts on the subject, I'm sure you do too.  Say what you want.<br/><br/>For those who somehow didn't read Andy's thread, and yet are still reading my own, here's a recap:
<blockquote>Sort of a cross between LARP and tabletop. Play groups can grow larger than a single table (into the dozens), and play can take place where any two players happen to have a chance to get together. (Almost?) no one knows everything that's going on, but everyone still contributes to shared context somewhere.</blockquote>
Here's the deal.  This is, as I said in the original thread, prompted by some of Tony's stuff on <i>Misery Bubblegum</i> (which is a way cooler name, so I'm going to use it; if you actually want to find the threads in question, you'll probably have to search for the lame new name <i>Dulcimer Hall</i>) and by some ideas spurred by Joshua BishopRoby's <i>Agora</i>.  Oh, and a huge heaping-helping of recent reading of online freeform archives (and some academic texts on fandom and fanfiction).<br/><br/>Over in that thread, Jeph says:
<blockquote>This could be incredibly cool... I think the only way it could work is that, during any given instance of play, the only things that could be affected are things controlled by those present. 'Cuz otherwise you get shit like, "Oh, you guys hired Leo to take out the half-owlbear mage? But Jess and I totally bound Leo's soul to a pentacle and incinerated his body last week!"<br/><br/>Unless you've got some way to deal with contradictions like that? 'Cuz that would rock.</blockquote>
It's an interesting conundrum, and one that I'm considering seriously.  I've got more than one model in the works, they may or may not end up combined.<br/><br/>1. Using online play as a model, it turns out that only using the stuff you control can be ridiculously powerful, so I'm not sure this counts as a problem.  You just have to schedule a time for you and the people you need in whatever planned scene you want to do to get together.  It might take you a couple of weeks, but hopefully you can manage it.  (Note, this solution assumes relative ease of contact.  You have to be able to get together with everyone else -- or at least the main people involved in your story arcs -- without huge amounts of work.)<br/><br/>2. Inspired by <i>Agora</i>, everything is recorded on cards, cards you can keep in your pocket (or somewhere on your person).  Whatever you're carrying, that's the stuff you control.  You write in changes as they happen, and you (hopefully) pass some of the cards at regular intervals.  Alternatively you utilize an online repository (similar to the one I'm using for my online <i>Agora</i> playtest), from which you can draw fictional 'items' as needed, and which can track changes to said items.<br/><br/>3. Inspired (again) by online freeform play, I may just end up working up something for pure online play.  Period.  At the moment I think a lot of the online techniques can be adapted to more 'traditional' face-to-face play, but I'm not entirely certain that this is the case.  There are some serious differences between the two mediums (article forthcoming this week, tell Jason Morningstar I haven't forgotten), and it's possible that those differences will simply make it impossible to take this as I'm currently envisioning it to our world.  That said, there <i>is</i> a lot here that we should be learning from, I'm just not sure what's applicable... yet.<br/><br/>So, thoughts?  Concerns?  This applies to everyone, but this is especially an appeal to people who play online freeform already...<br/><br/>Thomas                </div>

                            I really like the second idea: carrying around stuff on cards. That works.<br/><br/>We've talked about this before, though. Have a look at <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=652&amp;page=1#Item_96" rel="nofollow">How much should we get to see?</a> and also some of the discussion on Troy Costisick's game Hierachy.<br/><br/>One quick (patronising) comment on this: this is the kind of discussion which makes tabletop players go "Whoah! That's crazy. That's never been done. It's like totally splitting the SIS" and LARP players go "Yeah, we've been doing that for years".<br/><br/>Sorry, that was too patronising, but you know what I mean? To put it in a more positive light: LARP GMs do this stuff a lot, so it's worth learning from them.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Graham,<br/><br/>Yes on the link, that's one of the specific Tony threads I was thinking about, actually.  I just didn't want to go dig it up.  Oh, and I didn't mention it as a source, and later felt bad about it, but some of this thinking is rooted in Chris Lehrich's <i>Shadows in the Fog</i>, which I'm (again) too lazy to link.<br/><br/>Patronizing?  Nope, not much.  LARP is definitely something I was thinking about when I started looking at this.  While I'm not intimately familiar with it, I do have what I think is a pretty good working understanding of LARP, so I'd like to think I'm totally overlooking it.<br/><br/>That said, and with the caveat that there is likely plenty of cool LARP stuff that I don't know about, even LARP isn't doing what I'm thinking of here.  Two major differences, one tied to the other.  The first is that you still have a GM (or group of them) that act as gate-keepers and arbiters of game-canon.  They're in charge of keeping all the various plot balls juggled smoothly.  They act as gate-keepers to play (in a sense).  The second, which is probably very much due to the first, is that people tend to LARP within very specificly delineated times.  Probably because you have to have a GM there to let your stuff into the game.  (Feel free to correct me on either of these, if this isn't generally true in LARPs...)<br/><br/>(Aside, I wonder if gate-keeping is a worthwhile topic to pursue.  It seems that in traditional table-top play the entire group acts as gate-keepers, which might explain why we are often so hesitant to play without certain players...  Then again, maybe not.)<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

<code>Probably because you have to have a GM there to let your stuff into the game. (Feel free to correct me on either of these, if this isn't generally true in LARPs...)</code><br/><br/>This really isn't generally true in LARP, infact in the major fest style LARPs in the UK it is most definitely not the case.<br/><br/>Play is quite freeform, with few references to rules necessary in normal play.  If the players do something, then it happens even if there is no ref around.  Infact most of the game is conducted without the explicit presence or necessity of a ref.  Refs are only called for special instances or when rules arbitration is necessary.  And rules arbitration is rarely necessary as the system in these kind of games is designed to be as light and as easily enforced as possible.  So refs are rarely needed.  I could sum up the core of one system as follows:<br/><br/>"You pretend to be someone else by physically representing what they do.  Between the hours of 10am and 2am, for the duration of the weekend, anything you say and do is what your character says and does.  Your character will die after 2 minutes if someone hits you the player once in the head or chest with a weapon.  Don't do anything which would endanger the safety of another player, don't drop out of character and don't take the piss"<br/><br/>Essentially the role of the ref is to adjudicate rules questions on special cases, and to guard against cheating (primarily not taking hits, which is actually rarer than you'd think)  <br/><br/>The ref doesn't really control what "enters the game" in any real way.  They don't act as "gate-keepers to play" because play is <i>whatever happens between the players</i>.  If you the player say it, your character says it.  If you do it, your character does it.  The SIS is almost entirely equivolent to the physical reality of the players.<br/><br/>Now, there are obviously systems which function like you describe, but they are by no means universal, or even the norm.  Personally I don't enjoy them so much as it is very restrictive of play to have to continually need a ref to validate what has happened.<br/><br/>Drew                        </div>

What if when two facts contradict one another, there's a "Fact-Off" and players spend currency and roll dice to determine which fact survives. The other group has to go back and figure out how to "unfact" reality.<br/><br/>Bob: We hired Leo to take out the half-owlbear mage. <br/>Lisa: But Jess and I totally bound Leo's soul to a pentacle and incinerated his body last week!<br/>Bob: Fact-off!<br/>*Lisa and Bob roll dice and stuff.

                            You can avoid this, Adam, if only one person (who can only be at one table) has the half-owlbear mage at one time, as per my suggestion.<br/>

Otherwise...<br/>

What if the "other group" is no longer present, in its entirety?<br/>
<br/>
What if the other group is split up, playing at other tables?  Do you halt all play while you resolve the paradox?<br/>

                            Vax, that's an interesting idea.  I'll spare the long story of how I had an experience at a single-game mini-con that was cross tabletop and LARP, but here's how my brain fired off yours:<br/><br/>Small Con. Housecon, Meetup or a small event at an existing convention. Whole event is like 4-6 hours long, maybe an extra hour for beginning explanations and rules and the like.<br/><br/>People break into 3-4 tables for the hour play. When the alarm goes off and they reassemble, a generation has passed (or, maybe, 10 years).  Each table is a different land or region or something.  Maybe there's a GM at each table who is consistently there in each iteration.<br/><br/>That might lead to some cool play.                        </div>

                            Don't let me derail this really interesting line of reasoning, but do let me drop a quick contribution.  When I used the word 'tables' in my original proposal, I wasn't necessarily talking about physical tables that people play at.  I was using it as a unit of measure with each 'table' being the number of people you can comfortably play most roleplaying games with (3~6, probably).  Now, that said, I think some sort of table-swapping thing could be dang cool.<br/><br/>Oh, another thing, I was also thinking much less bounded.  Everything you need to play is carried with you, in your pocket or whatever.  You want to do a scene with characters X and Y, so you and the players of those characters go out to lunch (or whatever) and you've got everything you need with you, and you play there.  No need to be 'at the game' or anything.  One of the big things I'm looking at is making play easier to get into and out of.<br/><br/>All that said, I like Fred's idea too, especially with the time-skipping between table swaps. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

<p>Oh hey, ya'll know what makes this whole concept -- the 'chaotic play' thing -- really incredibly awesome? Cell phones. 'Cuz then, say, Steve and Dan run into each other waiting in line to see Narnia 2: Electric Boogaloo. Steve's like, "Hey Dan, remember how I've been wanting to take out that half-owlbear mage you control? Well I should totally hire Leo to do it!"</p>
<p>And Dan's like, "Totally! Leo's a perfect fit! Let's do it, right now, right here."</p>
<p>So Steve says, "Right on. Leo's one of Mitch's characters, right? So I'll just call Mitch and see if I can borrow Leo for a bit." And Steve takes out his cell and calls Mitch.</p>
<p>But mitch goes, "Sorry man! Leo'd be a perfect fit for that, what with his Spear of Spell Slicing and all, but Jeff and Jess totally bound his soul to a pentacle and incinerated his body last week!"</p>
<p>And thus Steve and Dan know that they'll need to find another way to resolve their conflict.</p>
<p>The point being, in this day and age, information is fucking <em>omnipresent</em>. We've got a bajillion ways of communicating with one another, and then some. So if you want to do a scene with an element that some other play controls, just give them a ring and make sure it's legit! Bam! No problem!</p>

                            Jeph,<br/><br/>Yep.  It might be worth mentioning that I'm really, really big into communication theory these days, so that's very much what I was thinking.  Combine this with other forms of quick contact like instant messaging and text messaging (which more and more people are always connected to) and you've got something extremely interesting going on.<br/><br/>I wonder if it would be possible to set up play-elements in such a way that they could be passed in non-physical form.  That is, could you call up Mitch and have him, purely verbally, pass on all the information you would need to use his playing piece?  Then, when you finished your scene, could you call him back and pass it back with whatever changes were mechanically codified?  I was thinking that you'd have to pass around these index cards, but if you could do it verbally, well, that would rock on toast.<br/><br/>Jason,<br/><br/>Smart mobs...  I hadn't thought of that, but that would be hot.  I'm not sure the technology is there yet (I don't think it's very easy to form a spontaneous one), but in another couple of years I bet you'll be able to either send a voice page to everyone who might be interested, or mass-text message them all, and whoever shows shows.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

In a few years it'll be ubiquitous web-enabled devices, and it'll be criminally simple to do all kinds of real-time information processing, maintaining a database of game objects being modified on the fly through play, etc.  And people can play from home, too.

Two people meet (via internet, in person, whatever) and play out a scene.  When a conflict happens, they send identical SMS messages to the server (for authentication) to authorize resolution.

                            Actually, my solution to the paradox thing is, simply stated: who cares?<br/><br/>From where I stand, chaotic play isn't about telling epic stories, it's about narratives.  Personal ones.  Continuity doesn't have to be a big deal if we don't want it to be.  We appropriate characters and situations to make points, to experience particular things.  Often we discard aspects of the things we appropriate because they do not contribute to what we are doing.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Why should we feel so constrained to include the fact that a character is dead when we don't feel constrained to hold to so many other things?<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

Traditionally we tell stories linearly, which means that you have to pick one or the other.  There's nothing wrong with that, but I think it's unneccessarily limiting.  Can't I do both?  Can't I be invested in the story in which he's dead just as much as I'm invested in the story in which he's still alive?

Only doing it will say.<br/>
<br/>
My own story, the one I am actually in, can only be linear because we humans are linear creatures.  We experience time one moment after another.  One event follows the one before, and the road not taken is, well, not taken.  As such, I cannot help but be invested in it... after all, that's the one where I invested myself!<br/>
<br/>
To do otherwise, it seems to me, would be difficult, would go against our natural tendencies.<br/>
<br/>
This seems to me to be even more radical than Capes.  As such, it's certainly worth trying! <br/>
<br/>
I expect that people will be loathe to contradict events that they see as pre-existing and worth preserving, and may very well seek out ways to avoid doing so.                        </div>

                            Thomas, I'm mostly with you. I'm not entirely convinced that certain discontinuities won't ruin the fun of the narrative. To borrow a line from Richard Bach (terribly out of context): "that idea does violence to my intuition." When a given player is in the midst of a cool story and some other player comes along and is all, like, "no, he's tied up in my basement," and there's no systematic way to resolve that between the players, will that do violence to the player's intuition about the story?<br/><br/>But offer a simple rule to resolve it -- flip a coin to see whose story wins, and the other must make up a story to explain why he <i>thought</i> his side was true -- and the violence turns into fun.                        </div>

                            In the interest of 'show don't tell', here's a very minor instance of what I'm talking about with choosing X and Y.  Understand that it's somewhat idiosynchratic to the game at hand (in this case Milliways), but it's a great demonstration nonetheless.<br/><br/><a href="http://community.livejournal.com/milliways_bar/13459547.html" rel="nofollow">This thread</a> on Milliways is pretty typical for that game.  Note how the first post is the starting point.  Then note each separate thread which branches off from it.  You could read all of each thread, but the first five or ten posts is probably sufficient to see what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>Specifically, each of the three threads branching threads is (to an admittedly minor degree in this instance) mutually exclusive.  These three conversations can't all be happening as each posits that an entirely different conversation comes from that single starting point.<br/><br/>And you know what?  It's no biggie.  Exploring the various ways things <i>could go</i> is no less natural (or at least no more jarring by necessity) than a strictly linear sotry.<br/><br/>Now, I admit that this specific example isn't a case of a major difference, but I'm not sure that bigger differences present insurmountable problems...<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

<p><code>Otherwise each person carries around his own personal version of everything, and all the interactions with other characters are shams.</code></p>
<p>Heh.  Yeah.  The cool thing is, real life (maybe) works this way, and it doesn't seem to stop anyone from interacting, because <em>the space within which we interact</em> is defined in a linguistic manner such that we maintain the compelling illusion that we're all inhabiting the same reality.</p>
<p>We're kept from realizing that because of how limited our interactions (of necessity) really are.  We can't transmit our own experiences mind to mind, and so when we look up at the sky we both say "Wow, that sure is blue," even if I'm experiencing what you would label "orange" or "cold" or "salty."  But I've learned (by watching others) that the sensation is "blue," just as you've learned it, and so we <em>can never discover</em> whether we perceive things the same way.</p>
<p>So ... yeah, it's going to be a <em>wierd</em> game if everyone has to keep all of the different narratives going on in their own head.  That'd be funky.  But that isn't an inevitable outgrowth of having multiple narratives.  What if each person is experiencing a different story, and their interactions are structured in such a way that they can <em>never</em> discover (at least in game) how their story varies from the stories of other people?  That's natural as breathing, isn't it?</p>

                            It's true that our lived experience <b>feels</b> like a linear narrative, but by some accounts that's only because we impose order on it in retrospect:  the linearity emerges as we look back and try to make sense of the trajectory of our lives and times.  There are in any given instance, alternative versions of the story: people sometimes have "epiphanies" in which they re-envision their identities, in a kind of Gestalt switch ("Hey!  I've been kidding myself!")<br/><br/>But Fred's other point is well-taken:  at what point does honest playfulness become dysfunctional dickery?                        </div>

                            Actually, this reminds me of our playtest of MarkV's <em>Heads of State: Nine Short Games About Tyrants</em>.  We played through all nine of the mini-games with a set of four or five tyrants that we'd sort of cycle through.  Each individual game had a slightly different set of players.  The events that happened in each individual game were, to a large or small extent, mutually exclusive of each other.<br/><br/>One tyrant, The Green Star of Freedom, was assassinated, exiled, tried for war crimes and sentenced to life imprisonment, the dictator of a made-up nation and also the dictator of Uruguay, the patron of a large rambly family or many generations and a single child who didn't know who his father was.  And yet, I wouldn't say that any of these versions were different characters; they were all the same guy, just with different stories told about him.  It was very cubist.  But the important part is that the 'conflicts' didn't really detract from anything we played out.                        </div>

<p>The whole nonlinear play thing sort of reminds me of The Shab Al-Hiri Roach, and how it's always cool to see what happened to Regina Sutton that time when those guys over there played, as compared to what <em>we</em> put her through.</p>
<p>Another thing chaotic play reminds me of is this british game called Perplex City.  It's ... a real life fake treasure hunt thingy. You buy these packs of cards, with puzzles on them. When you solve a puzzle, you enter the card's serial number and the solution into the web site. Then you get points. Points give you clues to find a <em>real life buried treasure</em>. Like, there's an actual real world object called the Receda Cube that the game company has buried <em>somewhere</em> on the planet. There's a $200,000 reward for digging the thing up and turning it in.</p>
<p>So you've got a whole bunch of people basically playing in the same scenario, with some having more info (particularly, as to the cube's whereabouts) than others, except it's sort of ... more real? ... than your traditional LARP or MMORPG or other massive SIS endeavor.</p>

                            Here's a potentially interesting thought on the subject...<br/><br/>What if the fundamental unit of play wasn't the 'game' or 'campaign', but rather the play group (or maybe 'the cast')?

                            The attraction is that the world is shared, no? Else why have the interaction and not just play with one group (as you now suggest)? If things can schizm constantly from the shared consensus, then nothing is really shared, is it? In which case, what's the point of having a shared, but not shared world? Isn't the idea of sharing the world to have this notion of actually playing in an alternate reality shared by many, many others? The MMORPG phenomenon? <br/>
<br/>
The whole UniWiki idea that I had was to create something like you're talking about. But that never really got going well, across several attempts. For a functional version of what you're talking about, ironically, see the D&amp;D solution with their "Living" campaigns. <br/>

                            Realize that I'm talking about some pretty far-out stuff here, and I'm not sure if it will actually be fun, but...<br/><br/>No, Mike, that's not quite what I'm talking about <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I mean, imagine a game (in the sense of the actual instances of play) in which people don't identify their play by plot-lines, but by their group.  So, when someone asks you 'So, what games are you in these days?', you don't respond with something like, 'I'm playing two games of D&amp;D, a really fun WGP game, and an every-so-often game of Universalis in which we keep adding stuff to the world', but rather with 'Well, there's a game with me, Bob, Sarah, and Frank.  Then there's the game with Janice, Frank, Billy, Wesley, and Meg.  Oh, and there's this totally sweet one...'  You get the idea, maybe.<br/><br/>Basically I'm suggesting that it might be useful to rearrange the way we conceptualize our gaming experience.  What if each group was its own game?  You're not playing multiple games with the same group...<br/><br/>I guess I'm trying to get at the idea that a linear plot is not the only, or even the best (though it's by far the most common), way to keep instances of play separate in your head.  Even in those experimental things where I've played the same characters through basically the same plot two or three times I've always classified each separate play-through as a different 'game' in my head.  But what if I didn't?  What if I had some other criteria for classification?<br/><br/>Yeah, I don't know either... but I bet it would be interesting...<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

I believe there's fertile middle ground between 100% shared and 0% shared.  If the world that you play in has important intersections with the worlds other people play in, what more do you really need?                        </div>

                            Thomas, I have no idea what you're tallking about any more. I mean, up at the top it looks like you're saying, "Hey, let's come up with a way that anybody can play a big game with anybody else whenever they get together." Now you seem to be saying, "Hey, let's think of the 'game' as whoever you're playing with." That seems totally contradictory to me. And the latter doesn't seem to have any of the attractiveness that the former has. <br/>
<br/>
I mean, from one perspective, Forgotten Realms satisfies your criteria. It's a world that lots of people use, but every group that plays in it has their own stuff happen. If it doesn't change, isn't altered for other groups by play, then what's the new part here? <br/>

                            Mike,<br/><br/>Really this is all me brainstorming around the edges of what I usually think of as a roleplaying game.  I, personally, have always had a strong hang-up of classifying play based on linear narratives.  Those linear narratives are the fundamental particle of play, so to speak.<br/><br/>I guess I think both of these are simply different aspects of that same issue: in the big play-whenever-you-can game, the fundamental particle of play is some sort of massive conglomerate of context.  Maybe it's all a single shared narrative, but then again maybe it's not (the whole discontinuity 'problem' discussed above).  This is something I think is cool and actively needs to be put together somehow.  The other thing, the who-you-play-with thing, that's me thinking about redefining the fundamental particle in a different way.<br/><br/>Let's break that second one open a bit more, and see if there's anything interesting there.  First of all, at least at this stage, I'm not talking about exhaustive listing.  So if Frank, Janice and I are in a group, and Frank misses a session, we're not playing a different 'game' since it's just me and Janice.  But, what if when Frank, Janice and I play, we play with the same ideas and characters and stuff no matter what system we play.  Maybe I play these three or four guys, and Janice has these other characters, and Frank has still another set.  And sometimes we use <i>Universalis</i> and play in the modern world, and sometimes we break out <i>Capes</i> and reinterpret our characters as super-powered people, and then to change things up we take our super-heroed characters and port them into <i>With Great Power</i>.<br/><br/>And all that stuff, we call it 'our game'.  We don't think of it in terms of 'when we played <i>Universalis</i> and then when we played some similar characters in <i>Capes</i>', instead we consider all of it one unit of play.  I don't even know exactly what this would look like, much less what implications it would offer, but I'm betting there's some interesting things to be found out there on the edges of how we classify units of play.<br/><br/>All that said, the big anyone-plays-whenever thing doesn't have to be that radical.  I'm sure it's going to have to be at least somewhat radical, since it has't been done before, but I suspect that the first couple of attempts will be remarkably traditional in a sense.  And there's nothing wrong with that.  I just enjoy thinking about and speculating on some of this really crazy stuff...<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Thomas, here's the thing that I don't buy: this breakdown doesn't fit with my experiences.  Even when I play with the same people, in different games and plotlines I and they play massively different characters dealing with very different themes.  Sure, there are some folks who always play the same character, and sure, we all have preferences, but I don't find this sort of reliable regularity in what thematic content I play being connected to who I am playing with at the time.  So while an intriguing proposition, I don't think organizing play by playgroup is actually going to afford us any insights into how we actually play.                        </div>

                            Josh,<br/><br/>Yeah, I agree.  I don't play that way either.  At the moment, though, at least when I'm playing out on the edges of stuff like this, I'm more concerned with how we <i>could</i> play than how we do.  So for me the question isn't, 'What does this tell us about how we play?', but rather 'What would it mean to play this way?  Would it be good, bad, neutral?  Is it worth pursuing this type of play?'  And at the moment, it's mostly just interesting, not compelling.  At least for me.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>
