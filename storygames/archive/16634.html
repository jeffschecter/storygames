We've used Scrum, we're doing Kanban. I am not an expert; I have no certifications or anything. I just try to apply the ideas and make things flow better.<br/><br/>There are a few principles we use that are relevant to roleplaying. Hooray! Here are some first thoughts; I'd love to hear more, from anyone. <br/><br/><b>Kaizen/continuous improvement</b><br/><br/>The idea of small, continuous improvements to the process. In Kanban, we usually have retrospectives every two or three weeks where we talk about how things have gone, and what we'd like to do different next time. It's pretty simple: Everyone says something that worked, something that didn't work, and something we'd like to change/focus on for the next interval. We make a list of change/focus suggestions, and everyone gets 3 votes. The things with the most votes get the focus. <br/><br/>In a roleplaying campaign, small improvements and experiments can be done every single session. Take each session as an opportunity to try something different, something new, or bring back something that was cool. See if you can make things better.<br/><br/><b>Flat structure</b><br/><br/>Many agile teams are based on the idea that anyone can step in and do anything. If the testers are too busy, a designer or developer can step in and do some testing. When a development task is ready for work, whichever developer is free should pick it and start working on it. It's more of an ideal than a description of the truth, IMO, but it helps focus on team responsibility.<br/><br/>In roleplaying, you could have on-the-fly GM responsibility. "We need a new encounter! Who's free to make one?" "Not me, I'm rolling up a new character." "I can do it! Give me two minutes to set up..."<br/><br/><b>Visualize workflow</b><br/><br/>Usually we use a kanban board - it's just three columns with ready, working and done (or similar) as headers. Everything that needs to be done is up on the board, and moves along when people work on it.<br/><br/>As I wrote in <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=15694" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>, you could have quests on the board, for instance - so that when the group was running out of quests, they'd pick some cool ideas from the GM's backlog of ideas, and he/she would prepare them for the next session.<br/><br/><b>No project manager</b><br/><br/>There's sometimes a facilitator or scrum master in an agile team. But there's no project manager - nobody says "you do this, you do that". It's very democratic.<br/><br/>Sounds to me like a GM-less campaign, right? You'd maybe have a facilitator to ask the right questions and remind everyone what the group has already agreed on - but no one person who said "this is how it must be!"                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380527/#Comment_380527" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-02T06:18:58+00:00" title="June  2, 2012  6:18AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm most fascinated by applying this to game design.

Start with <i>Apocalypse World</i> as a base, but with no PC moves. Just the MC stuff (also ditch Fronts / Threats / 1st Session guidelines).<br/><br/>2. Alter Agendas / Principles / Always Says / MC Moves to reflect the style of play you have in mind.<br/><br/>3. Recognize that this is a completely functional game. Consider playing it. Maybe the game is done now.<br/><br/>4. Distill categories of player actions into principled freeform moves (when you do x, it turns out like y).  Here's an example from a recent design conversation! Jason was talking about this Stasi-inspired hack he's working on and he said "My touchstone is <i>The Lives of Others</i>, so if violence happens it will be fast and stupid and inexplicable and tragic and final.\ufeff" Then John suggested this move:\n<blockquote><b>When you try to hurt someone,</b> it doesn't work out, for anybody. Choose one, some, or all:<br/>- It's sudden and final<br/>- It's tragic<br/>- It's inexplicable and stupid<br/>- It's horrific and traumatizing\ufeff</blockquote>\n5. Recognize that this is a completely functional game. Consider playing it. Maybe the game is done now.<br/><br/>6. Begin turning principled freeform moves into other types of moves if the moves are not fully satisfying (these can be AW-inspired moves but don't have to be; this is a general approach to design that could be used for all sorts of things). This is the most difficult and slowest part, since it may be one step forward and two steps back. Probably only do this a few moves at a time so that you can...<br/><br/>7. Test the moves in small batches by continuing to actually play the game. Sometimes one new move may render previously "finished" moves to be less perfect. Game design is hard. But the simpler and fewer your moves are (and the better thought-out they are) the easier it is to avoid these kinds of upsets. Sometimes it's necessary to shake the foundation, though. Or replace an established move with a principled freeform move and start over.<br/><br/>8. Eventually you can declare the game "done" or stop working on it. But your players and fans will probably continue the above process without you, either way.<br/><br/>Notice that <i>at no point in the design process is the game not completely playable</i>. This is critical. My advice: keep releasing playable drafts so other folks can enjoy your game while you continue to work on it.<br/><br/>Also: <i>you now have no excuse not to be playing your game</i>, if that's what you really want to be doing (and, really, why else design a game?). "It's not done yet" doesn't cut it anymore. If you don't like some things and can't think of anything better yet, just replace those portions with principled freeform moves until you get a new brainwave.<br/><br/>How does that interact with the things you've been thinking about, Matthijs?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt" title="Matt"><img alt="Matt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/6464691/920923"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt">Matt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380580/#Comment_380580" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-03T05:19:52+00:00" title="June  3, 2012  5:19AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, great ideas!<br/><br/>Related, you could take elements of behaviour driven development for RPGs.

However, two points:<br/>- In kanban, you don't aim for a perfect process somewhere in the future - you just keep changing it, always. To me, agile game design would be the same. There's no alpha, beta, and finished version; there's just the version we're using right now, and will change soon. Kanban would say "<b>Start with whatever game you're currently playing</b>. Describe clearly what you're <i>actually </i>doing (not what the rules say you should be doing, for instance). Formalize that - write it down. Keep doing it for a while, just the way you always have been, and then talk about what you'd like to change."<br/>- It would be interesting to have a simpler starting point. "1. Start with talking together about a fictional place, fictional people, fictional events. Recognize that you're already in a creative activity together." This isn't necessarily founded in agile principles, though, and might have nothing to do with what you're aiming for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380612/#Comment_380612" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-03T11:46:46+00:00" title="June  3, 2012 11:46AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, why start with Apocalypse World?
