I've been catching up on work since I took Friday off for Go Play Southeast.  I thought the event was a success.  There were a few bumps in the road but I sort of expected that since it was the first time.  The next Go Play Southeast will be better if only because I'll have the experience of having already organized one.  Here were my goals for the weekend:<br/><br/>1.) A relaxing weekend.  I didn't want there to be a big worry about food and cleaning and chores.  The biggest worries I wanted were who was running what game and how could we possibly fit all those games into 1 weekend.  I think we came pretty close to nailing this one.  The facilities certainly helped here.  Also, the fact that we only had 12 people kept any chores from getting out of hand.  Saturday lunch might have been something we would have had to work around but my wife volunteered to cook us all lunch, so that was taken care of.  Over all, not much stress on my part.  I hope everyone else had the same experience.<br/><br/>2.) Meet new people.  Some of the others will have to say how this one went.  I had only met Andy and the 3 guys from the area before.  Everyone else was new to me.  I had an awesome time making new friends.<br/><br/>3.) Play some new games.  Half the games I played were completely new to me.  I got to play Legends of Alyria and PTA for the first ime.  It seemed that in my groups there was always someone who was playing the game for the first time.  This is uber-cool.  Seeing how systems other than what I'm used to function stretches my perception of how things can be done.  I like it.<br/><br/>Anyway, these were my main goals and I think I hit them all.  Thanks to everyone who showed up and ran games.  You all rock.  Next time I will get to play a game with Jason Morningstar if I have to handcuff him to a table.<br/><br/>~Andrew                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82900/#Comment_82900" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-24T05:48:43+00:00" title="July 24, 2007  5:48AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks to Andrew for organizing everything, and to Hazel for a delicious lunch!  That was seriously excellent, and a total surprise.  <br/><br/>By way of debriefing, here are some lessons learned:<br/><br/>1.  If we're going out to eat, somebody local needs to have a game plan that makes sense.  Friday worked great, Saturday not so much.  I'd much prefer the Nerdly model where everybody kicks in more money and local guys buy a bunch of food, rather than eating out.<br/><br/>2.  Somehow I ended up running three games, which wasn't my plan at all.  Scheduling was a tiny headache.<br/><br/>3.  A "full service" venue (towels, kitchen, etc) is really nice.  Cleaning up Sunday morning was not a problem at all.  <br/><br/>Other thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_82903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will" title="Will"><img alt="Will" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayRound.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will">Will</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82903/#Comment_82903" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-24T06:20:37+00:00" title="July 24, 2007  6:20AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            GPSE was great!

In fact, I need to publicly thank (and apologize to) the NC group that came up to GPSE.  They carried the game running load.  Some of that had to do with them having the most experience with the games, I think but I should have done some more to mitigate that before the event started.  That was a failure to recognize a problem on my part.  I think the smaller group (12 at GPSE vs 60 at Nerdly) contributed to that some.  With more participants it is more likely that there are people experienced enough to run a game there so it doesn't always fall on the same small group.  Next year I will address this problem.<br/><br/>Thanks again to the NC bunch.  You guys made it work this year and I appreciate it.<br/><br/>As a side note about food.  I've got a friend who is going to school to be a chef.  Next year I think I'm going to calculate the cost and have her take care of all the food for us.  It'll add to the cost but will eliminate food worries, Walmart runs and any clean up.  I'm really wanting GPSE to be as close to a pampered gamer retreat as I can get it.  Andy was definitely into that kind of experience.  I noticed him enjoying the hot tub a few times.

I was realizing that, including the gaming in the car getting there and getting back (the "What happens in the car STAYS in the car - freeform D&amp;D LARP"), I did 6 times as much gaming at GPSE than I did at Camp Nerdly even.<br/><br/>I really had a good time. I loved the slow, relaxed atmosphere, the fact that we didn't have to do tons of food/cleaning organization, etc. I also loved the hot tub, it reminded me of onsen/hot springs trips in Japan, and I somehow found myself each night going to bed at 2AM or 4AM after a soak, then bolting up at 6:45-7:00, ready to take another soak.  I'd suggest that in future years a hot tub will not be a "Must Have", but it is definitely a draw point and very, very nice.<br/><br/>I took a day off afterwards to bask in the refreshing glow, and that really helped me adjust from the idyllic non-reality of the cabin, talking, gaming, and hanging out, and get back into "work/stress/go Go GO!" mode.<br/><br/>Also, yeah I agree with Jason: Everything was excellent (doubly so for Hazel's lunch. Hot damn that was good food), and I normally think like 5 steps ahead when it comes to time management/group outings, and somehow I never even considered the idea; "16 people trying to go to a sit-down dinner at 7:00 on a Saturday in the biggest tourist town in the state in the middle of the summer is probably a bad idea". It quickly worked out, though, so that was awesome.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>Finally, I posted to the GPSE list, but I have someone's small leather beige dice bag, which is filled mostly with opaque red/black dice of all types (with some other colors as well).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82910/#Comment_82910" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-24T07:14:23+00:00" title="July 24, 2007  7:14AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love to see some AP reports of the sessions I wasn't in.

In other words, I would have loved to play more with the latecomers.<br/><br/>I really had a lot of fun, and it was all due to you guys.
