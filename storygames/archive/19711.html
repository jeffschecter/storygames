I\u2019ve got a theory that the improvising mind will come up with some more over-the-line stuff than someone who\u2019s working off prep and tables. But that\u2019s a side topic)</small>.<br/><br/>The second the MC asked the group if we had any lines or veils. We hemmed and hawed, I guess we didn\u2019t really want to dig the depths of our psyches for stuff but after a while someone said \u201cOK, how about no violence against kids?\u201d Which we all thought was fine. But later the MC did introduce an element of that into the game. I almost thought this was on purpose, that I had missed some move on my readthroughs of AW, \u201cThrow their biggest fear back to them\u201d sort of thing. But a year later I asked him and he said \u201cWow, I didn\u2019t even think of that, did I really do that? If so, I apologize\u201d.<br/><br/>The third time it was me who had a line. I said \u201cNo sexual violence\u201d. But soon after, one of the other characters based his whole character concept on being a victim of that.<br/><br/>So I thought nothing of this. But recently while I was looking for something else, I found this concept on Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_suppression" rel="nofollow">thought suppression</a>.\n<blockquote>When an individual tries to suppress thoughts under a high cognitive load, the frequency of those thoughts increases and becomes more accessible than before. Evidence shows that people can prevent their thoughts from being translated into behavior when self-monitoring is high; this does not apply to automatic behaviors though(e.g. the skinhead scenario) and may result in latent, unconscious actions). This phenomenon is made paradoxically worse by increasing the amount of distractions a person has[.]</blockquote>\nIs this a real issue when it comes to the concept of explicitly discussing lines and veils?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437694/#Comment_437694" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-25T05:50:47+00:00" title="August 25, 2014  5:50AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Before I go on; is this particular line of argument a discussion that\u2019s already been had to death?

I actually had a conversation about precisely this point at a con here in the UK a year or so ago, when were about to start a game about families, in which I thought it highly likely that flags of one sort or another would come up. One of the players made the same observation as in the OP, albeit expressed in a less scientific way (no intended slight on your phraseology above). I've recently concluded that, as many of the other posters here have said, the X-card is the best technique for resolving this issue, although I want to give a shout out here to Microscope's palette: each player gets to pick up to two things they definitely DON'T want to have happen in the game, and up to two things they definitely DO want. <br/><br/>P.S. I've made it a policy to include in all my high-emotion games a section that I call <i>Word of warning</i>, where I discuss the problem of trigger topics, and suggest four possible solutions. FWIW, <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44973653/WTHI.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>'s a link to one of those games (the <i>Word of warning</i> section is on p2).

Maybe you don't realize it, maybe you don't think that it's going to show up in a game like this. It's a good way to handle that without carpet-bombing the game with restrictions ahead of time.

Plus: In an ad-hoc storyline, there's no particular way to know where you're going until you're almost there.

Sometimes, it's not the <i>topic</i> but <i>how it's handled.</i> Like, I can almost always handle drug use in games and it doesn't bother me at all, but occasionally we hit a place that I don't want to go. But I don't want to bring this up at a table with people who I'm not super close with. I don't wanna say "no drugs because I'm in recovery," before we play because usually the topic is fine. I just want to be able to say in the moment "can we not do this?" and know that it's an option, without having to tell a bunch of strangers about my problems.<br/><br/>X CARD FOR LIFE                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437710/#Comment_437710" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-25T12:19:24+00:00" title="August 25, 2014 12:19PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2014 12:21PM by 2097.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seems like it\u2019s pro\u2013X-card all the way.

It is a clumsy method (yet pretty common for some reason - maybe it's the most obvious way that people can think of for introducing this theoretical concept in practical play?) that suffers from the same issues that you get with artificial flagging: people lie, people don't know what they want, and people ignore what others want. Besides, in reality everything depends on the context, so the only reasonable answer to this question preplay is anyway going to be "I'm cool with anything, provided I like the way its done". This being the case, I am not the least surprised if line and veil discussions prove ineffective.<br/><br/>(Hey, I can actually name a game that does explicit preplay lines and veils in a major way: in <i>Capes</i> the players write a "Comics Code" at the beginning of the campaign to coordinate the lines and veils. I give Capes some points for the fact that the Comics Code discussion has the potential to clarify a literary genre for the group, but the supposed lines and veils function is just as useless as in any other game.)<br/><br/>The right way (or let's say, best practices way according to me) to go about this matter is to a) communicate clearly about your enjoyment and comfort during play, and b) pay attention to the enjoyment and comfort of others. It is here where the payoff for "lines and veils" theory resides: you realize that there is a difference between including something and depicting it, and you realize that you actually have the choice of not doing one or both if that is the correct choice for this group, right here and now. The point of thinking about lines and veils is to realize that people sometimes want lines and veils, not to try the near-impossible feat of divining them in advance.<br/><br/>Besides, it would feel very icky to me to, like, list atrocities at the beginning of play in an attempt to create some sort of explicit social contract of what's OK and what's not. It's a very geeky, socially clumsy idea in my eyes that you could get some sort of social protection from caused offense or hurt by pointing at a pregame contract and claiming that you were allowed to do thing X, because it was not listed among the disallowed things in advance. I can't imagine anybody outside various censorship bureaucracies and American geek folklore thinking like that.<br/><br/>Finally, <i>Microscope</i>'s palette is a very clever mechanic.

You expect active listening, compassion and thoughtfulness. In my experience, playing with tables full of strangers, simply articulating this expectation goes a long way toward obviating the need for the tool later on. I always have it on the table when I play with new people and it rarely gets used, but when it does it's really important.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437714/#Comment_437714" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-25T12:45:02+00:00" title="August 25, 2014 12:45PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>My experience with similar policies so far has been that I didn\u2019t dare to speak up <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/><br/>If it\u2019s a physical card that I could just tap and be encouraged to tap... it might be better.</blockquote>\nAnd yes, I was considering taking up this aspect of the matter: there are different table cultures among various traditions of roleplaying, and at least around here many of them have cultural taboos about frank and immediate discussion of what you like and what you don't. An example I'm particularly familiar with is trad GM-plotted games, where players are expected to primarily deal with the content of play in a state of focused concentration. It's simply not part of that culture to express your internal reactions to anything much, because you got to be quiet when it's not your turn, and when it is your turn you've got to be all thespian with your character. The theory is that you give feedback after the session, but we all know that the only correct answer is "the GMing was fine, let's play more next week" <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>I've developed a willfully open table manner myself over the years very much consciously, because I believe that immersive focus and passive reception is <i>not</i> the ideal state for the players to be at the table. Rather, you should laugh or frown, and give immediate feedback: this thing her was funny, I really appreciated the clever idea there, and so on. Also negative feedback: I'm bored and what exactly are we trying to accomplish here. Mindfulness, paying attention to what is actually happening moment to moment, and helping others see it as well. Everybody pays more attention to each other when you actually communicate.<br/><br/>This pertains to the lines and veils issue in exactly the way Sandra notes: it is not easy to dare to speak up about something that makes you uncomfortable if the communication standard at the table is that nobody communicates anything about how they feel. In that kind of social context any complaint at all, no matter how minor or harmless, takes on the visage of major creative crisis. In a way the lines and veils "technique" makes this worse by mystifying the entire thing: doing something in the game that upsets another player becomes this huge social contract break instead of a minor misstep that can be corrected with the flex of the wrist.<br/><br/>I should say that I have nothing against the X-card or similar symbolic rituals as a solution, I just haven't ever felt the need for them myself. I'm sure it's a good way to open a hole in the wall of silence. For a group that appreciates the silence, a ritualized interruption is probably even better: I've noticed that immersionist gamers tend to like having specific gestures and such to separate "in-game" and "out-of-game" from each other.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437715/#Comment_437715" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-25T12:51:06+00:00" title="August 25, 2014 12:51PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><i>Microscope</i>'s palette is a very clever mechanic.

I don't totally condemn lines and veils as a safety tool but is problematic tool with limited use. But it still a place in the tool box, if you are aware of the limitations.<br/><br/>The thing is not just about thought suppression. When you list your lines and veils things you tend to mention things you feel conflicted about. In BDSM circles people tend to joke that if you say you never do X that exactly will be doing in 6 months. Because if X was something you really had no interest in exploring what so ever, you wouldn't feel the need to mention it. You wouldn't feel a need to draw a line there.<br/><br/>The same way you don't feel a need to say "I will never hit myself in the head with a hammer." You don't need to draw a line about hitting yourself in the head with a hammer. Because of course you wont. You have no interest in hitting yourself in the head with a hammer what to ever.<br/><br/>But you might say "I will never go sky diving". Because in that case you are some level drawn to sky diving, at the same way you feel scared by it. That is why you draw a line there. Because you have conflicted emotions about the subject.<br/><br/>Sometimes when you draw a line at some things is actually because you are a bit curious about it. At the same time as you are repelled by it. That way a player might say "I don't like graphic description of eye being mutilated. I'm drawing a line there" and then the same player describe exactly such a scene 30 minutes later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437760/#Comment_437760" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-26T02:29:54+00:00" title="August 26, 2014  2:29AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps you need to face your sky diving demons eventually but you don\u2019t want to do it at the gaming table with a group of people you don\u2019t really know.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437761/#Comment_437761" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-26T02:44:12+00:00" title="August 26, 2014  2:44AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree.

The set up went great, and this is people I have played with for a long time. People that I had all sort of discussions about roleplaying games, sensitive subjects, lines and veils, safe words etc with. We usually play boldly and let ourselves be vulnerable. We have played games that touched on all sort of difficult subjects.<br/><br/>Today something hit a nerve by mistake. Suddenly a subject that usually don't  (And to avoid hitting anyone else nerves I going to mention that the post will touch on the subject of child abuse)<br/><br/>In the game the godis new wife, Vigdis, was of an age with the godis oldest daughter Gudrin. There was a power struggle going on over which one of them was in change of the household. Vigdis also had a small child, Bera, and the thrall Sigrid took care of Bera.<br/><br/>There was a conflict in a scene about if Sigrid would take care of Bera as Vigdis had ordered her, or clean the house as Gudrin bid her. The conflict escalated into a situation where the small child Bera was punished by Gudrin. The punishment of Bera clearly passed the line to child abuse, because Gudrin was angry at Vigdis. None of the players where OOC playing in a malicious way. Things just escalated bit by bit in that direction.<br/><br/>The child abuse scene hit a nerve for me. I think it was because:<br/><br/>1. I worked with a disabled child that as the same age as Bera for a long time, and the child passed away at young age.<br/>2. I wasn't mentally prepared that for a game where child abuse might come up.<br/>3. I was playing the Godi as a good father and Bera was his favorite child. Bleed happened.<br/><br/>It became to much for me. It really hit a nerve. During the scene where the child abuse was played I was fine, but perhaps 10 minutes later I felt sick to my stomach and chose to call it and tell people that I wasn't feeling comfortable. And we stopped playing, talked a little and decided to not to continue the session and had some dinner instead.<br/><br/>While child abuse is sensitive topic that need to be treated with respect, I never reacted strongly emotionally to it before when games touched upon the subject. I have no expedience of child abuse, I don't have any regular contact with children, and I have no particular problem with seeing it in movies or described in books.<br/><br/>But this time, because of the reason listed above I reacted strongly to it in a way I didn't expect.\ufeff<br/><br/>I have a lovely game group and know that I would be respected if I spoke up about being uncomfortable. Sometimes things like this happen. Theme comes up in way you didn't plan for, and you react in ways you didn't expect too. For me, that is okay. It okay to be uncomfortable and it okay to speak up of you uncomfortable, and it okay if something hits a nerve by mistake at times.\ufeff</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437771/#Comment_437771" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-26T07:21:22+00:00" title="August 26, 2014  7:21AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Every time I read a discussion about Lines and Veils, I get the mental image of "gaming culture" as a sort of mindless juggernaut that always goes to the wrong road, no matter what you say or do (it's not an image limited to "lines and veils" discussion, that image come up really often ever in other topics, but with l&amp;V it's not "often", it's "always")<br/><br/>Lines and Veils were proposed in "Sex and Sorcery" as a mean to talk about delicate issues at the table. During the game. It was a way to tell people that they could, at any moment, during a game, "veil" some content or draw a line, and saying "I would prefer to use a veil here" is much easier than stopping the game and explain the whole thing.<br/><br/>They were NEVER intended to be used for a pre-play list of things to avoid or veils! That is a really bad way to use them, exactly for the reasons cited in the opening post, and many more.<br/><br/>I have explained this thing at least....  twnty times, I think, in different forums and communities, and I have read the same thing explained by others I don't know how many times.  <b>but it never takes</b>.  It's like there is a force that pushes people's brain to think "lines... veils... I have to make a list of things to avoid before the game... ". Even if the proposal and description of the technique goes totally in another direction.<br/><br/>Yes, there are a lot of different techniques that could be used, not only lines and veils. The "x-cards" for example. But to judge a techniques, it should be used as intended. But with lines and veils, it's always a case of <a href="http://xprogramming.com/articles/jatbaseball" rel="nofollow">"I tried Baseball and it didn't work</a><br/><br/>At this point, I simply think that the "lines and veils" technique should be abandoned. There is something in gamer's brain or social environment that can't accept the concept and ALWAYS turn them in that abomination of a pre-game list. This doesn't happen with the x-cards (there is no space on the card for the list, maybe, or the card is more associated in gamer's brain with "use during the game", and don't conflict with the "talk only in character" pressure), so the x-cards is much more fool-proof in a gaming environment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437772/#Comment_437772" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-26T07:28:26+00:00" title="August 26, 2014  7:28AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I said this at several other places on this forum, but not in the actual X-card thread: I've been implementing the X-card in any game that can have sensible and controversial topics, and I do tour around on conventions to set up different kinds of games to play with strangers.<br/><br/>I have never ever seen the X-card being used in play, but here's my thought about that: it's because "the power of saying no" gives you control to stop what's happening at any time.

Now, if, not having mentioned it beforehand, it came up during the game, a person with that phobia would be quite likely to become, at the very least, somewhat uncomfortable, so what's wrong with him or her being able to bring it up pre-game?                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437777/#Comment_437777" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-26T07:55:17+00:00" title="August 26, 2014  7:55AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>...I get the mental image of "gaming culture" as a sort of mindless juggernaut that always goes to the wrong road, no matter what you say or do</blockquote>\nLike the term "story game".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437779/#Comment_437779" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-26T08:04:51+00:00" title="August 26, 2014  8:04AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, that's a good point.

If you're the one with the phobia, trust me, it's every bit as problematic, but I don't want to debate this with you, so I'll let you have the last word <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437787/#Comment_437787" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-26T09:43:23+00:00" title="August 26, 2014  9:43AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've found both pre-game discussion and during-game outs like the X-card to be useful.

In that case it made a ton of sense because the content of the game would tend to lend itself to the use of slurs, so specifically calling it out as something she didn't want was probably necessary or at least wise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437795/#Comment_437795" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-26T11:08:57+00:00" title="August 26, 2014 11:08AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/catty_big">@catty_big</a>, it seems that you have taken from what I wrote the exact opposite of what I was saying.<br/><br/>Lines and veils should not have to be justified. Ever. They don't need a phobia, a trauma, ANYTHING: they can simply be a creative choice. "I think that the scene should be veiled at this point, guys, I don't want to describe a sexual intercourse in detail" (the last part of this phrase would not be said, really, because you don't need to say it Nobody does.  I added it here because in these discussion it seems we need extra details to understand what we are saying. In practice, at the table, it would be simply "and now let's draw a veil". Stop.<br/><br/>How can they works like this if you need to explain it before playing? "sorry, guys, but if, in this game of D&amp;D, there will be a scene where someone touch my pee-vee with sexual intentions, the veil should be drawn exactly at the moment the first finger will touch it. If instead we have a BDSM scene, it should be drawn like this. If during the game i have to go to the bathroom, the veil should be drawn exactly at the moment I will unzip..." and on an on and on an on and on and on for anything, in the universe, in all literature and life, that could be veiled. A list 200 pages-long every single session.<br/>You see how it's insane? How can someone even imagine this could ever work, it's beyond me.  It was always clear, for me, how it really worked, so I was never able to understand the mindset of the people who always think that it should be a pre-game list of "no-no"s.<br/><br/>Now, let's imagine that I am playing with someone who was abused sexually. If I know it, you think the he/she would have to tell me, every single session, for my entire life "for this session, I want to draw this veil, and this one, and this one, and this one..."?<br/>I think that there would be no need to write me the list not even once, because I would already know to avoid the topic. So, even in this case, the "initial list at the beginning of the session"  would be harmful, reminding every time everybody and forcing him/her to say it again and again.<br/><br/>What if I don't know him/her and it's the first time we play together? Well, the pre-game list is still the worst way to do it. If the player want to talk about it before playing, the best way to do it is when we talks about what we want to play. Different games have different risks. And before playing it's better to have a <b>conversation</b>, not a list.<br/><br/>Do you know the worse aspect of the list idea? That it allow things acritically. If you say at the beginning that intercourse was to be veiled but petting was okay... what if during the game you want to draw a line (not even a veil) about a simple kiss, for any reason? Do you risk the social "shame" of negating what you said, or not? Don't you see how you are instead free if there is no list, if you can simply say "no, ugh!" when you want?<br/><br/>Let's return to the case of someone who was abused. Let's say that the game is D&amp;D,that we are in a situation where we don't know each other enough (or that simply the player is keeping the fact a secret from anybody). The player is used to D&amp;D games, with his/her regular group, where there no sex, ever, in D&amp;D. So he/she sign up for the game thinking to be secure. And then during the game, he/she realize that someone is bringing sexual content to the game.<br/>If they use lines and veil in the manner they should be used, all he/she has to say is "sorry, guys, could we please draw a line to any kind of sexual content tonight?" and he/she has not to say anything private, has not to reveal anything, <br/><br/>It's not perfect, people can be in social situations were they are still afraid to ask for lines and veils...  but I really don't see any advantage in saying to these people "hey, if you are not comfortable enough asking for a veil during the game... you should <i>make a list every time</i> of anything you don't ever want to think about during the game!<br/><br/>I don't know exactly what Avery MacDaldno says to players before the game, but I am rather sure that, if it works, it's a conversation between human beings about what they want to play, not a simple list of things that should not ever be talked about in the game, because the simple existence of the list would defeat the purpose.<br/><br/>Because at the end, "lines" and "veils" (and x-cards and "ratings" and "pitches" and all the other things used) are parts of the conversation, useful for specific uses and not others.  What is useful during a game (a simple "stop, veil!") is not what is useful before playing (where a conversation about what to play would be much more useful that saying "sex, yes, bondage, no, eating meat no, killing of animals not apart from reptiles....").<br/><br/>(maybe that is the issue: in many gamer's mindset, probably lines and veils are seen as a way to AVOID talking about what to play...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437800/#Comment_437800" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-26T13:23:21+00:00" title="August 26, 2014  1:23PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good post, Moreno.
