My co-author and I are currently in the fairly early stages of putting together an RPG (I won't bore you with pages of details) and right now we're putting some thought into how we'd like social combat to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe following problems crop up a lot with social combat systems in RPGs:<br/>\n<br/>\nMother May I?<br/>\nPlayer: I've got the diplomacy skill coming out of my ass, I can convince the jailer to give me the key, pleeeeeeeeeeeeeese?<br/>\nGM: No, he ignores you so you don't get to make a roll.<br/>\nPlayer: Fuck.<br/>\n<br/>\nDiplomancer<br/>\nGM: And what do you say to the guard to convince him to give you the key?<br/>\nPlayer: 31 on my diplomacy check! Booo yeah!<br/>\nGM: And what do you say?<br/>\nPlayer: I got a 31, he damn well better give me the key.<br/>\n<br/>\nFreestyle:<br/>\nGM: Nobody gets any social skills, just roleplay it out and I'll make the NPCs do whatever I think is realistic.<br/>\nPlayer: But I want to play a character who's much more witty and charming than I am.<br/>\nGM: Too bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeterministic:<br/>\nGM: You failed your greed check and reach for the coins.<br/>\nPlayers: Its obviously a trap, I don't touch any!<br/>\nGM: Too bad, you failed your greed check, now roll to dodge the trap.<br/>\nPlayer: Grrrrr.<br/>\n<br/>\nDualistic:<br/>\nPlayer 1: Thanks my my high social skills soon he will be putty in my heads. Mwaaa ha ha.<br/>\nPlayer 2: This is boring, I'm going to smack him upside the head with my club.<br/>\nGM: You miss and now the NPC attacks Player 1.<br/>\nPlayer 1: Fuck, will all of my successful social rolls against him help me at all in combat against him?<br/>\nGM: Nope.<br/>\n<br/>\nPC Aura:<br/>\nGM: And the beautiful maiden impores you to rescue her brother with honeyed words and promises you a monogramed handkerchief as a token of her affection.<br/>\nPlayer: *yawn* Diplomacy doesn't work on PCs, if she wants us to get off our asses she damn well give us something that's worth more money thank a hanky.<br/>\n<br/>\nAsshole:<br/>\nPlayer: You mean I can get Shiny Points that make me more powerful by acting like an asshole in ways that annoy the rest of the party.<br/>\nGM: Yup.<br/>\nPlayer: Cool, now do I get more Shiny Points if my character also has Tourette syndrome?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we're trying to do is make a social combat system that avoids all of those pitfalls, which is easier said than done. Any suggestions/vague brainstorms about how to do about this would be greatly appreciated, as would recommendations of RPGs that would be good to mine for social combat ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur basic outline of stuff that we're looking to implement is:<br/>\n1. The same rules apply to PCs and NPCs and these rules are solid rules not just GM fiat.<br/>\n2. Good social skills are not mind control, they can't force PCs or NPCs to ever do what they really don't want to do. PCs retain free will at all times unless there is some kind of magical mind control element at work. <br/>\n3. Social Combat has meaningful mechanical effects.<br/>\n4. There's plenty of synergy between social combat and brute force skills.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109513/#Comment_109513" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-24T21:43:22+00:00" title="November 24, 2007  9:43PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First off, I love your layout.  I think that really covers a lot of "theory" ground actually!  I love the "Freestyle" one. Between that, Mother May I and Diplomancer I think we see a lot of the problem areas that we see in games like D&amp;D or other "just a few social rules" games where (and only where) the GM/DM is a dick, or Just Does Not Know How to Roll With the Punches or Change the Story. <br/><br/>It's gonna be hard to override the GM being a dick. Or the players being dicks. But you can certainly, I dunno, make a few cool tricks so that social moves are as interesting as other traditional things (like combat). <br/><br/>Here's some advice:<br/><br/>1) In your writing, no matter what system you go with, friggin outline all that stuff up there in your first post, in that book. Put it in the readers' faces. Tell them that This Is Wrong, and give them suggestions as to ways to stop it, get around it, deal with it, and just not fall back on that behavior. Give little play examples, like how the Mother May I GM might have not gone the cockblocking route, etc.<br/><br/>2) Why make the system equal for PCs as NPCs?  PCs, the players' characters, are probably the only ones that matter. Perhaps make two different systems. Hold their standards apart. Perhaps make rules that NPCs can never "make PCs believe stuff", but they can give them a Happy Point or something.<br/><br/>Otherwise, perhaps do something like this:<br/>(incidentally, this is a side rule for Tenra Bansho English edition): PCs can "be convinced" (by losing a Diplomacy roll-off or something) like they convince NPCs. In other words, if their leader told them to betray someone, they'll do it. They won't believe in it, but they'll at least go through the motions. However, if the player wants to resist, maybe there's a box they can check off, called "Belief". It's like the "Death Box" in games that have that box. Basically, if you check that box off you get to wave the damage you just received, and get some extra Social Hit Points or something. But if you then go to zero, not only are you convinced to do whatever, but you believe it is the right thing to do too (even grudgingly), and will seek to do it unless overridden by another later followup roll or something. Maybe.<br/><br/>Or<br/><br/>Again, make Social Combat dynamic.  I had a dream of a game (this was before BW's Duel of Wits) where social combat took place on a battle mat, where you had three social resources to balance, and all sorts of points, roll abilities, and tricks like flanking, etc. And physical combat? Oh, that was just hand-waved based on the description the players gave. In other words, the exact polar opposite of how we normally see it go down in a normal RPG. Just a fantasy, but might be worth pursuing.

Good social skills are not mind control, they can't force PCs or NPCs to ever do what they really don't want to do. PCs retain free will at all times unless there is some kind of magical mind control element at work.</blockquote>\nWhat about games that handle this with stakes setting? If you're PC just doesn't want to do it, don't agree to the stakes. My problem with saying that social skills are not mind control is that if the social combat is not going to force a behavior, why do it? Just hit him with a tree. I've been thinking about the PCs role in a social combat. Here's my thoughts: The players behind the characters are actually engaged in a negotiation about the story their going to tell. Let's say I'm playing a cop and you're playing a mob boss. Your mob boss wants to bribe my cop to work for him. I could just decide to take the bribe or I could decide not to. Let's assume I decide that the cop is torn between his greed and his sense of duty. We decide that a social combat is in order to see if you can convince the cop to turn or if the cop resists temptation. Assuming we both find that conflict interesting, we're cool. Hopefully we find something of interest in either outcome. We verbally spar and you win. I take the bribe. I agreed that my PC would take the bribe if you won the conflict. This is now the story in which my cop took a bribe. I can't just change my mind or roll a will check and say "Nah, I steel up my resolve and throw the bribe in your face."  Later, something might change and we might agree that I'm having second thoughts and want to back out of the deal, but I gotta take that bribe or it was all a waste of time. So in my thinking, players retain freewill. PCs are fictional characters and have no such thing. They do what players decide they do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109523/#Comment_109523" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-25T00:29:37+00:00" title="November 25, 2007 12:29AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>Uh, so, there're a lot of things to<em>avoid</em>up there, but I don't see any goals.

But did post some rough design goals.\n<blockquote><br/>David, I'm curious if you've played any of the games that do social combat and what your experiences have been.<br/></blockquote>\nWell I've done some one-shots but the only real campaign-length game I've played was a simplified SotC one (the GM cut out some of the more complicated Fate point economy stuff). I loved it silly, it was a real eye-opening experience for me. Previously I thought of Roleplaying as doing stuff that is stupid tactically in order to make the game more fun, with SotC I didn't have to do that at all. What I'm shooting for in social combat is something along the lines of how SotC aspects work, you never HAVE to do along with them but if you don't you loose a Fate point. Basically if you lose in social combat you shouldn't have to do what someone says, but you should pay some kind of mechanical cost (kind of like spending a Fate point) if you don't. There's some things about SotC social combat that I don't like so much, but that bit is just inspired.<br/><br/>Most of what I'm doing now is reading as much game design info as I can so that I can avoid re-inventing wheels, but I haven't been able to do as much playing of Indie games as I would like. Will hopefully be able to play more next year when I move into the center of Seoul and will be able to do weekday games...\n<blockquote><br/>What about games that handle this with stakes setting? If you're PC just doesn't want to do it, don't agree to the stakes.<br/></blockquote>\nHaven't gotten to play any stakes setting games. Will have to give some a shot, but that way of doing things is probably a touch more free-form then what I'm shooting for. Dunno, will have to do some more reading and try to play more different games.\n<blockquote><br/>My problem with saying that social skills are not mind control is that if the social combat is not going to force a behavior, why do it? Just hit him with a tree. <br/></blockquote>\nExactly, making social combat meaningful without it being mind control is HARD. What I'm kind of grasping towards is more "you lost social combat now do what he says or get hit by X mechanical penalty" instead of "you lost social combat now do what he says" But its working out the details that is hard.\n<blockquote>So in my thinking, players retain freewill. PCs are fictional characters and have no such thing. They do what players decide they do.</blockquote>\nRight, that's taking a step back from the action and getting a bit meta.

Yeah and that's where I start getting problems with the "you lost social combat now do what he says or get hit by X mechanical penalty" idea. It would be hard to apply to NPCs in which the GM doesn't really care if they get hit by a mechanical penalty. But what I really want to move away from is X skill check REQUIRES Y reaction.<br/>3. Ya, am grasping at that direction. I think a lot of the game we're cooking up is sort of BW ends accomplished with SotC means, if that makes any sense.<br/>4. Sort of what I mean is that if you've had a long session of social combat with someone that should have a mechanical impact that matters if a fight then breaks out. Sort of social combat being a way to soften up the spirits of the opposition even if you know that a fight is going to be inevitable.<br/><br/>Thanks for the feedback all!<br/>Sorry about the three posts but the forum software doesn't seem to take kindly to verbosity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109538/#Comment_109538" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-25T07:17:19+00:00" title="November 25, 2007  7:17AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daztur, in order to get what you want I think you need to have cases where the PCs lose a social conflict and have their behavior determined for them.

At the heart of it, this is about the distribution of authority in your game. Who gets to decide what, and when and how do they do that. You say you don't want mind control. So what exactly do you want? What part of the fiction are players determining, and how is this resolved?<br/><br/>First, you want player characters, with resources of authority tied to them. That alone is a big step, but because it's the traditional way most people don't recognize it as such. Most of the players (except the GM) affect the fiction through one character, and their ability to affect it is tied to the character. It doesn't have to be this way--the players' ability to affect the fiction could be independent of their characters' fictional abilities.<br/><br/>Now, the second big step you're making is to hand over authority over the character's "inner" workings, their psychology, to the owning player, while placing the "outer" workings (such as taking damage) within the determination of the resolution system. That, too, is a step with vast consequences. I've played in many games where both inner and outer workings were up to me, i.e, if you shoot a gun at my character, I get to say whether you hit and what kind of damage you do. Every time, no exceptions. <br/><br/>There are games that don't completely do this; see Call of Cthulu's sanity, KULT's shock system, or Das Schwarze Auge's negative attributes. Some games give the option of giving some of that authority away through drawbacks/flaws. So if you want social skills to matter, you need to figure out what exactly the exceptions to the total control of inner workings are that you're handing to the resolution system. I can't tell you how to implement social combat if I don't know what in the fiction can be affected by it. But this doesn't have to be mind control, if the fictional facts are simply "you're afraid" or "you have doubts." They can leave the final decision of character actions still up to the player.<br/><br/>With the things that are completely within the players' control, you might want to use incentives instead of direct authority. Make it a temptation, like FATE's aspects. If you choose to let your character believe the NPC's lies, gain a resource point you can use to your advantage in some other way. This can be powerful if the entire system is set up around it (like I <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=15040.0" rel="nofollow">suggested here</a> a little while ago).<br/><br/>Alternatively, you can implement penalties for not following the impetus of the social skill used. If your thief lies to the guards successfully and they still try to catch him, they get a -5 penalty because they're confused, or have doubts, etc. They can also work like Oaths in Agon, in that you can call on them at certain points.<br/><br/>Finally, social skills can place conditions on other characters that have predetermined effects. These can be penalties, but they can also be other effects. Having a predetermined "Scared" effect (D&amp;D has a few of those) that you can inflict on others with your Intimidate skill is a good example. But "In Love" could be another effect. Also see aspect tagging in Spirit of the Century for a very broad, undifferentiated type of condition. I've got a game called <a href="http://docs.google.com/View?docID=dg5qr5st_3dz2ftb&amp;revision=_latest" rel="nofollow">Pentripolis</a> in the works that was based on using conditions for all types of conflicts, including combat and social attacks.<br/><br/>In summary, with your basic setup of player characters with related resources and fundamental player control of the inner workings, you can:<br/><br/>1) Give clearly defined exceptions to the authority to the resolution system; <br/>2) Use incentives to give weight to social skills;<br/>3) Use penalties for going against the outcome of a social conflict; or<br/>4) Allow social skills to inflict specific conditions on other characters.<br/><br/>This is probably a non-exhaustive list <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109552/#Comment_109552" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-25T09:26:55+00:00" title="November 25, 2007  9:26AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On inflicting conditions, see also: Vincent's <i>Afraid</i> and my <i>Geiger Counter</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109553/#Comment_109553" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-25T09:59:21+00:00" title="November 25, 2007  9:59AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 25, 2007 9:59AM by Max Higley.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Daztur</cite>Player 1: Thanks my my high social skills soon he will be <b>putty in my heads</b>.

Sometimes the end goal is to convince someone, but sometimes it's something else -- like getting a key, ruining someone's reputation, securing a promotion, and so forth.  In all of these cases, potentially many someones have to be convinced of certain things.  You could either focus on the immediate goal of convincing or the end result that is sought, and there are different ways to resolve those two approaches.  Stakes setting is one way to focus on the end goal rather than the internal state.

Good social skills are not mind control, they can't force PCs or NPCs to ever do what they really don't want to do. PCs retain free will at all times unless there is some kind of magical mind control element at work.</blockquote>\nHere's a question about #2: how important is it that PCs be unable to force NPCs to do things they don't really want to do? Is it a really strong consideration for you, i.e., "<i>no one</i> should be able to force anyone else to do something with these social rules" or is it more "I don't want NPCs to be able to force PCs to do stuff and since I want PCs and NPCs to play by the same rules that means PCs can't force NPCs either"?<br/><br/>Because the problem I'm seeing is that if you don't want <i>anyone</i>, PC or NPC, able to be forced into something, then it's still all going to come down to GM fiat. All the GM has to do is arbitrarily decide "OK, no, this NPC <i>really</i> doesn't want to do that, so you can't make him" and no matter how good your social mechanics are at that point, they become essentially meaningless.<br/><br/>If you decide it's cool for PCs to be able to force NPCs to do things but you want players to always remain in control of their character's actions, an easy solution would be to just say that NPCs aren't <i>allowed</i> to initiate social conflicts. Like, the king can say "I demand you end your quest for the Mystical MacGuffin <i>right now</i> and marry my ugly daughter instead", but he can't actually start the process of dice rolling to make that happen. Only the <i>player</i> can say, "Oh, <i>hell</i> no! My guy's <i>totally</i> going to talk his way out of this!" and pick up the dice. If he wins, he gets what he wants: the king changes his mind. If he loses, he <i>doesn't</i> get what he wants, and he has to decide whether his character will give in and marry the princess or refuse and accept the consequences. But either way, he remains in control of his character's decisions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109567/#Comment_109567" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-25T11:32:06+00:00" title="November 25, 2007 11:32AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Daztur</cite>"you lost social combat now do what he says or get hit by X mechanical penalty" instead of "you lost social combat now do what he says" But its working out the details that is hard.</blockquote>\nA lot of games do this sort of thing with resources.

In a nutshell something like this (we're working on some more complicated stuff that will work a bit like SotC aspect tagging):<br/><br/>1. You have Will points.<br/>2. Will points can be used for a variety of things like ignoring wounds, pushing yourself to the limit, etc.<br/>3. Social Combat will be all about placing what I'm calling "Compulsions" on your opponent, which would work a lot like doing a maneuver to place an aspect on someone in SotC. For example a Compulsion could be simple like "run away!" or something like "you believe that I am telling the truth about my brother's suspicious death." The main difference between this an SotC is that there is no way to be "taken out" Socially and no stress track.<br/>4. Any time that a character doesn't obey one of their Compulsions they lose a Will Point and the Compulsion disappears.<br/>5. Will Points would be regained in a variety of ways, the main way we're thinking of doing this is by having the players do things that relate to their core beliefs/aspects (basically a lot like how BITs work in Burning Wheel or how aspects work in SotC). We've got some ideas about how to make these things work, but I'll skip that in the interest of brevity.<br/>6. If you run out of Will Points then you go into negative will points. Will have to think up some nasty mechanical penalty for being in negative Will Points.<br/>7. If a character has negative Will Points then the GM can give him a penalty on any action and give him a Will Point back (if you have negative will points your will to fight has been sapped).<br/><br/>Or to summarize: if you lose social combat you can either go along with what your enemy wants or have your character's will sapped. <br/><br/>The problem with this is that while I think it would work well for PCs, it might run into problems with NPCs since if the players are meeting an NPC just one then it doesn't really make any difference if the NPCs will gets sapped or not. Will have to think about that. Any ideas?\n<blockquote>You say you don't want mind control. So what exactly do you want? What part of the fiction are players determining, and how is this resolved?</blockquote>\nExcellent question, that is REALLY something I need to think about. To use GNS ideas, I think what I'm sort of trying to do is use a lot of the cool ideas from Story Games to make something that's much more Simulationist than most Indie games.<br/><br/>"A Simulationist game in which simulating the way that character development and emotions function in the sort of novels that I like is prioritized over the sort of things that Simulationist games usually focus on. In order to do this I will use a lot of mechanics that are primarily used in Narrativist games while preserving the old school boundary of the GM having absolute control over all of the choices that NPCs make and PCs having absolute control over the choices that the PCs make. However, while the players are free to make whatever choices they want to make, there are always consequences and the consequences will be as much emotional as physical."<br/><br/>Think that's a decent mission statement, if a bit theory-heavy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daztur" title="Daztur"><img alt="Daztur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daztur">Daztur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109607/#Comment_109607" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-25T23:27:41+00:00" title="November 25, 2007 11:27PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It doesn't have to be this way--the players' ability to affect the fiction could be independent of their characters' fictional abilities.</blockquote>\nRight, its a question of how much metagame authority to give to the players.

I'm kind of trying to have my cake and eat it do by giving the players authority over the character's "inner" workings while at the same time applying game mechanics to the character's "inner" workings.<br/><br/>I think how I'm going to try to pull this off is what you suggest when you say "they can leave the final decision of character actions still up to the player" but allow the mechanics do dictate stuff like "you're afraid" or "you have doubts." So basically mechanics dictate a lot of the emotions that a character feels but they always have the free will to go against their emtions, but doing so will have a real mechanical cost. A lot of the game, if designed right, will be the players wrestling with their emotions...\n<blockquote>Make it a temptation, like FATE's aspects. If you choose to let your character believe the NPC's lies, gain a resource point you can use to your advantage in some other way. </blockquote>\nYup, very Faustian. That's exactly the sort of thing that I'm shooting for, although I was thinking of doing it the other way round mechanically (lose resources if you don't believe the lies).\n<blockquote><br/>1) Give clearly defined exceptions to the authority to the resolution system; <br/>2) Use incentives to give weight to social skills;<br/>3) Use penalties for going against the outcome of a social conflict; or<br/>4) Allow social skills to inflict specific conditions on other characters.<br/></blockquote>\nYes, that states very clearly what I'm trying to do, more clearly than I was saying it.

I'm trying to think up something that would work as well for long-term mental manipulation as it would for making a good first impression...\n<blockquote>Because the problem I'm seeing is that if you don't want anyone, PC or NPC, able to be forced into something, then it's still all going to come down to GM fiat.

If I make Social Combat all about "do what I want or you will lose a Willpower Point" and its possible to go deep into negative Willpower, then what happens if the GM has the NPCs just eat all of the Willpower loses and never do what the PCs say? The PCs will sometimes go along with what NPCs want since going down into negative Willpower would be painful to them, but if the PCs are talking to an NPC that they'll never see again then the PCs don't gain anything but sucking away their Willpower Points.<br/><br/>Hmmmmmmmmmmm.\n<blockquote>A lot of games do this sort of thing with resources. Its "do what he says" or spend a fate point (or whatever) if you really want to avoid doing it. I think this works nicely, but it can become "do what he says" when you run out of fate points.</blockquote>\nRight, I'm trying to do just that but let people go into negative fate points so that people never HAVE to "do what he says." I think that that works great for PCs, but what doing the same thing for NPCs seems to open the door for control freak GMs who never let the PCs push around their NPCs.

Like, if you're at -3 going into a conflict, the other guy gets 3 points right then and there. That'd give everyone a strong motivation to stay on the positive side <i>and</i> help temper the control freak GM -- if he <i>really</i> wants to protect his pet NPC or whatever he can do so only at the cost of giving away control in some future conflict.<br/><br/>But do you <i>really</i> want to spend your time trying to keep control freak GMs in their place? I mean, I have a bad habit of slipping into control freak GM mode myself on occasion, so I appreciate systems that help me curb that impulse.

That sort of bribery is supposed to work for players, so what's good for the goose etc. That means that the offered currency must be a scarce resource for both the GM and the players.<br/><br/>I think that sort of system might eventually come down to a zero-sum economy: if the players pay out to get their way, the GM gets paid. If the GM pays out to get his way, the player(s) get(s) paid. But since not everyone can get their way every time, you might either have to have a way to outbid each other, or have some method outside the economy thats equitable between all participants. <br/><br/>Once you've gotten to <i>that</i> point, you run up against the basic question of whether all participants are equal within the system. Unless you've given an experienced GM a damned good argument in favor of being an equal participant (i.e. it's "more fun" than their current process), that rule will get ignored and/or be treated as "broken" and get houseruled. Etc. ad nauseam.<br/><br/>In the end, it might come down to setting playstyle expectations in your (non-rules) text, and setting up an in-play economy that supports that expectation. If the player breaks one side or the other of the equation, the whole house of cards comes down. I'm not sure there's a more logically elegant solution possible.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109715/#Comment_109715" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-26T16:33:11+00:00" title="November 26, 2007  4:33PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The problem I'm personally seeing here -- the sense of "it's all or nothing" -- is handled rather well by things like Burning Wheel's Duel of Wits system.  There is a winning and losing side, but how far down the winning side is brought determines the sort of compromise that much be done.  Real life isn't a series of absolute victories/defeats, like the phrase "social combat" would suggest.<br/><br/>I've seen the "you lost, submit or be penalized" sort of technique used, and have even fiddled with it myself, but in truth it's as uninteresting as "you list, submit."  The Willpower or whatever just becomes ablative armor for your character's freedom.  You still get to say "no," just like if you didn't resort to mechanics, until you're forced to say "yes."  Sure, there's the fallback of "save your willpower for the big arguments" or other such comments, but look at how players tend to react when control of their character is removed from them.<br/><br/>(Aside:  we're talking about roleplaying games with traditional player-GM roles.  The player-character is the player's only anchor to the world, so when that is wrenched outside of his control, then you disconnect the player from the game.  Look at folks who call bullshit on that sort of play and stonewall the game -- they admit they're out of control, and regain control by acting against the game.  Look at folks who accept their character's predicament and play it to the hilt -- they admit that their character didn't get his way, but they're regaining control by playing it out.  The heart of this issue is only of an outside element controlling the only force the player typically gets to control -- his character.)<br/><br/>Okay, maybe that's not much of an aside.  Look at BW's Duel of Wits again -- if you as a PC lose an argument, you can still propose a compromise (a disastrous victory not withstanding, but those don't seem common).  That's how you as the player get to retain some control, and thus keep the player-game connection going.<br/><br/>So, taking this idea back to the "you lost, submit or spend a willpower to say 'no'" idea, this isn't a reasonable player choice because there's only one good answer.  If you make the idea <em>keeping</em> willpower interesting, by perhaps making willpower (or whatever currency you deem suitable) useful for another mechanic -- and not just as a sort of armor, but to actually <em>do something</em> -- then the choice is between "do I use this currency to defy this loss" or "do I submit, but keep this currency for later because it's also handy for these two other things that I like doing"?<br/><br/>Of course, there are many, many different ways to present reasonable player choice in a game system, and getting players to accept choosing the bad thing is a difficult, but I think rewarding, quest.  That needs to be kept in mind when trying to build a social conflict system that doesn't suck.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109720/#Comment_109720" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-26T17:02:12+00:00" title="November 26, 2007  5:02PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the things I like about the Burning Wheel Duel of Wits is concessions.

Often, I find that there's a big distinction to draw between a change in a character's <i>actions</i> and a change in their <i>convictions</i>. <br/><br/>Like, take an example that could happen in any Dogs game: Brother Artax finds out that one of the townsfolk has acquired the habit of filling himself up with drink and coming over to Artax's sister's house and paying her unwanted "visits", but because he's so high-profile and well-connected in the town, she hasn't said anything about it. He storms out into the night with his gun at his side to go put some bullets in the bastard.<br/><br/>Another player's Dog is on watch, and stops Artax in the street, saying, "Don't do this. We serve the King's justice, not your own. You have to take your feelings out of this. Don't make me force you." It's been well-established that the Dog on watch is the physical badass of the group, and has a lot of traits like "I'm a big scary mofo 1d8" and whatnot.<br/><br/>Assume that Artax's player loses or Gives in that conflict. What does it mean? Practically speaking, only that Artax won't follow through with his plans in that fashion, <i>in that moment</i>. It doesn't mean that the other Dog convinced Artax that he's in error, and it doesn't mean that his attitudes or beliefs have suddenly shifted. For all we know, the follow-up conflict to that is Artax trying to sneak past the Dog on watch to go do the same deed. Or, Artax might stage an "accident" later, or whatever.<br/><br/>A lot of uses of social skills work the same way. Losing to a seduction attempt doesn't magically make you emotionally attached to someone. You might wake up the next day and be horrified by what you've done. Being convinced to help someone in the middle of duress doesn't make you loyal to them - in fact, you could grow to resent them later.<br/><br/>Take your PC Aura example, for instance: Suppose the maiden does handily charm the living crap out of a PC. All that means is that right there, right now, the PC will agree. That has nothing to do with whether or not that PC will end up actually doing it, once all the details come out.<br/><br/>Making this kind of thing clear is a big key to making a social combat system work well, IMO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daztur" title="Daztur"><img alt="Daztur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daztur">Daztur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109738/#Comment_109738" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-26T21:00:33+00:00" title="November 26, 2007  9:00PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Do you know Weapons of the Gods?

He has a pool of Will points (replenished how? I'll let you figure that out) that he can use for any NPC that doesn't have their own.

If he runs out of Will points, then apply somSociae of the same penalties to ALL minor NPCs the same as you would a PC going into negatives. </blockquote>\nThat could work, sounds like a cool way of having social combat mook rules. Now I've got to go and figure out how to deal with Social Combat that deals with bunches of people all arguing, a lot of other games social combat rules don't deal well with that, primarily because it seems pretty hard to do...\n<blockquote>At the beginning of this thread, I was going to suggest checking out Burning Wheel for it's DoW, and was also going to mention my own ongoing project, where I made the Social Combat system essentially identical to the Physical Combat system, with social damage that mirrored physical, but it sounds like you've got something going that'll work for you, once you figure out how to overcome the final snags. </blockquote>\nYeah, my co-designer is very into having Social Combat rules mirror Physical Combat rules as closely as possible. A lot of the ideas I've been posting about on this thread I haven't gotten a chance to run past him yet and he's probably going to modify a bunch of them to try to make Social and Physical Combat rules more similar than a lot of what I've been saying. What sort of things have you been doing along these lines?\n<blockquote>Doesn't SotC also treat any and all conflicts as fundamentally the same? Including the ability to maneuver and inflict aspects, fully defend, etc.? </blockquote>\nSort of. The game we're designing started out as a Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice and Fire (the wonderful George R. R. Martin fantasy series) mod for SotC and as we came up with more and more ideas it has became progressively less SotC-ish, (especially when he decided to throw out the FUDGE dice) but there's a lot of SotC stuff still there. Basically what we're doing differently from SotC is:<br/>-No Social taking out (this is the main thing). <br/>-Getting rid of Social consequences and stress boxes and just sticking with inflicting aspects.<br/>-Making what happens in Social Combat ever more relevant in Physical Combat, primarily by having Social Combat be the best way to drain the enemy Fate/Willpower points.<br/>-Getting rid of the more complicated elements of the Fate point economy.<br/><br/>So basically SotC with a twist. I'm trying very hard to not waste my time reinvented wheels.\n<blockquote> If the GM wants to ignore a diplomancy attack from a player, the player GAINS a fate point. Give fate points a use in battles and you have a tie-over. </blockquote>\nHmmm, that could work as well. Depends on how much metagame mechanics we want built into the system. \n<blockquote>But do you really want to spend your time trying to keep control freak GMs in their place? I mean, I have a bad habit of slipping into control freak GM mode myself on occasion, so I appreciate systems that help me curb that impulse. But if I was the kind of GM who wanted to be a control freak, a system that tried to stop me isn't one I'd be likely to pick up in the first place. </blockquote>\nRight. What I'm shooting for is for there to be about the same amount of GM fiat involved in Social Combat situations as in Physical Combat situations. Having a lot of or a little GM control can both be good, I just don't think its a good thing to have a lot of GM control in one half of the game and much less in another part of the game, it makes players focus their characters on whichever part of the GM the GM has less fiat control over (usually the combat half).\n<blockquote>What if once you went into the negatives, your opponents gained fate points in conflicts against you?

Basically I'm trying to have my cake and eat it too by making social combat powerful without ever forcing the PCs to say "yes." Letting PCs sink down into negative willpower points and penalize them for that was my idea for getting around that problem. Maybe a bit clumsy though...\n<blockquote>So, taking this idea back to the "you lost, submit or spend a willpower to say 'no'" idea, this isn't a reasonable player choice because there's only one good answer. If you make the idea keeping willpower interesting, by perhaps making willpower (or whatever currency you deem suitable) useful for another mechanic -- and not just as a sort of armor, but to actually do something -- then the choice is between "do I use this currency to defy this loss" or "do I submit, but keep this currency for later because it's also handy for these two other things that I like doing"?</blockquote>\nRight, that what I'm aiming for. Basically I'm planning on makeing Willpower:<br/>1. Do a lot of the stuff that Fate points do in SotC.<br/>2. Be the social of social armor that you're talking about.<br/><br/>So social combat will often be about either:<br/>1. Hitting the enemy with stuff you KNOW that they'll reject in order to sap their willpower and keep them from doing all of the things that Fate points allow you to do in combat or whatever in SotC.<br/>2. Hitting the enemy (or a friend) with things that don't ask to much and don't seem worth spending a willpoint to reject to subtly influence their behavior.\n<blockquote>1 fate point, but have to make a major concession/consequence.

I think I'll do something along these lines:<br/>1. Character kicks other character's ass in Social combat, lays a compulsion of "sleep with me or spend two willpower points" on the loser.<br/>2. Character who loses the social combat doesn't want to spend all of his willpower points (they're useful in combat and whatnot) but he also doesn't want his character getting seduced, so he decideds to spend one fate point and downgrade the compulsion to a kiss or something and goes along with that.\n<blockquote>Which is an inherent problem when you get into subjects that (a) aren't just binary and (b) cannot otherwise simply by quantified &amp; calculated. </blockquote>\nRight, but I think its doable if done in the right way.\n<blockquote>Another thing you have to keep in mind is how much the consequences of a social conflict "stick".

We've cooked up another whole sub-system for personality and personality change (in very simplified SotC terms: reject a compell of your aspect too many times and you aspet changes). Need to do more work to wire together the personality and social mechanics. I think that the line I want to draw is that social combat can mess with a character's emotions, but not alter the character's convictions (but can put the player in a position where altering their convictions becomes tempting).<br/><br/>Thanks for the good ideas about how to handle PC vs. NPC Social Combat, I'm a lot shakier on that than about NPC vs. PC social combat and now I've got a lot of potential mechanics I can consider <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109748/#Comment_109748" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-26T23:16:32+00:00" title="November 26, 2007 11:16PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>EXACTLY.

Justification is important. In that sense, SotC has more of an issue of your "Mother May I?" weakness than anything else, really - if you have a conflict scene where one person's goal is "intimidate you into leaving the bar", and you go with that, you're assenting on some level that such a result is possible and potentially plausible. <br/><br/>If the other person in that scene has aspects like "Veteran Lawman" and "The Line of Duty" and is extremely combat-capable, however, then you might decide it's unlikely that such a conflict could even occur - you're just not going to scare that guy away. You still have mechanical options, like using Intimidation as a maneuver to place a "Startled" aspect on the lawman, but the conflict's going to have to take place in another arena.<br/><br/>This is also an oblique addition of feedback to this thread - while SotC handles this issue mostly through social contract, you might want to take a more explicit route.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daztur" title="Daztur"><img alt="Daztur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daztur">Daztur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109761/#Comment_109761" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-27T00:44:56+00:00" title="November 27, 2007 12:44AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, I'm not trying to say anything bad about SotC (it's the game that made me realize how cool Indie games could be), just that I'm shooting for something different.

I meant what I said in my last paragraph; hence, you bring up good issues for consideration in the design of your system. SotC mostly trusts negotiation and out-of-game interaction to parse out the problems you bring up, which you might consider a feature or a bug, depending on your tastes. I consider it a feature, but having helped design it, my bias is evident and so my input should be considered in a biased context. Please do consider it that way - I'm totally all for my biases not working out for you.<br/><br/>What I'm curious to know is how you might consider parsing out issues like the one I bring up - suppose you have a lawman going into a bar to rescue a hostage, and the villain's chief lieutenant waiting for him. The chief lieutenant rises to his full height and the player says, "Physical intimidation is what I do. I try and scare him into leaving the bar." (Note I'm not talking PC or NPC in this example, because I'm not convinced it's relevant.)<br/><br/>As soon as that happens, basically we're talking about a few options:<br/><br/>* There's a process of determining if conflict stakes are valid, and people decide this conflict just couldn't happen.<br/>* The lawman character is built so that he can brush aside the intimidation, be it with Willpower or whatever.<br/>* There's a degree of flexibility regarding goal fulfillment, so that the lawman can lose the conflict but not give the lieutenant everything he wants.<br/><br/>So, ideally speaking, how will your system handle that, and why?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109832/#Comment_109832" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-27T10:01:01+00:00" title="November 27, 2007 10:01AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Daztur</cite>Which is an inherent problem when you get into subjects that (a) aren't just binary and (b) cannot otherwise simply by quantified &amp; calculated.</blockquote>\nRight, but I think its doable if done in the right way.<br/>But not necessarily mechanically.  For something like this, you'd do well to focus the text on advice for this situation, rather than try to mechanically state "this is a small compromise and this is a big compromise" or whathaveyou.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Daztur</cite>Right, that what I'm aiming for.

And depending on how like Fate points you're going, they already serve a purpose to reduce issues in social conflicts by altering the roll that brings them to the situation in the first place.  Since Fate points can already mitigate situations, I don't see how your social armor element actually adds value to the concept.  Granted, I don't see how you're planning on implementing the idea, but here's what I was mentally toying with after I wrote my last post:<br/><br/>Say you have a fantasy game with fighters &amp; wizards -- pretty stock-issue, simple stuff.  Willpower is useful for both: fighters can use it to push past the pain of his wounds to continue fighting, and wizards use their force of will to make magic happen.  This stat is truly <em>useful</em>, in that it is directly linked to their schitcks &amp; talents.  Add to that the option of being social armor, and then you have the following choice:  "Do I give in and keep being a badass fighter/wizard, or do I block the results of the conflict at the cost of being so badass in the near future?"<br/><br/>The former, with Fate point-style things and whatnot, is just using a bail-out system in another, similar way.  If you hand someone a bail-out system, they're going to use it, so it's not an interesting choice.  The latter is turning a useful element into a bail-out system for crucial situations, if you don't mind that by doing diminishes your strength as a protagonist.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109837/#Comment_109837" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-27T10:17:09+00:00" title="November 27, 2007 10:17AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Hmmm, that could work as well.

If the GM can just ignore arguments and hand out points, no amount of morale points will have meaning unless they have uses where their effects can not be waived.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110051/#Comment_110051" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-28T11:13:40+00:00" title="November 28, 2007 11:13AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...so, what if they weren't morale points but experience points?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110061/#Comment_110061" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-28T11:37:17+00:00" title="November 28, 2007 11:37AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>...so, what if they weren't morale points but experience points?</blockquote>\nOh, that's hot.

I thought it'd be fun to see how it holds up against your pitfalls, both to validate my design and to validate the pitfall theory.\n<blockquote><br/>Our basic outline of stuff that we're looking to implement is:<br/>1. The same rules apply to PCs and NPCs and these rules are solid rules not just GM fiat.<br/>2. Good social skills are not mind control, they can't force PCs or NPCs to ever do what they really don't want to do. PCs retain free will at all times unless there is some kind of magical mind control element at work.<br/>3. Social Combat has meaningful mechanical effects.<br/>4. There's plenty of synergy between social combat and brute force skills.<br/></blockquote>\n1. Yes, the same rules apply to PCs and NPCs. The rules don't say it explicitly but it's implied by the analogy to combat (which is the same for PCs and NPCs).<br/><br/>2. I think I've nailed this. The rules need to make this more clear. Essentially, you keep taking social damage until you make it stop. The effects of that damage might be embarrassment or loss of resolve but nowhere does it say that damage (or losing all your social points) will make you do something against your will. You can essentially <i>choose to give</i> to avoid the social damage. So if I want to coerce you to sleep with me, I can lower your SP till you're socially weak, but it's your choice whether you go to bed with me or not. Doing so will obviously stop my social attacks.<br/><br/>3. I think the Damage by Attack Type table covers meaningful mechanical effects.<br/><br/>4. I don't think there's any synergy between social combat and brute force skills. There's "room" for it, if I was inclined to add it. I can see the value.<br/><br/><br/>On to the specific pitfalls now. In general, my system totally fails to account for Diplomacy and Intimidate and other social skills. Crap. I could slide them in as bonuses to social attack and defense rolls, I think. Let's look at the pitfalls using a different interpretation of "skill" as the Base Social Attack/Defense Bonus that each character has.<br/><br/><b>Mother May I?</b><br/>No, the GM has to use the social combat system. The jailer doesn't get to ignore you. But is there any incentive for the GM to "give" and have the jailer give you the key to avoid social pain? Not really.<br/><br/><b>Diplomancer</b><br/>The rules say that you must describe what your character is doing, but it doesn't require you to be silver-tongued. In other words, you have to at least describe what your character is doing. I think I narrowly avoid this pitfall.<br/><br/><b>Freestyle</b><br/>Did I avoid this one? You can't make anyone do anything, but you can give them encouragement by threatening them socially.<br/><br/><b>Deterministic</b><br/>I don't understand why "greed" uses a social mechanic. It seems more of an internal emotional thing. But let's say that, instead of making a greed check to avoid reaching for the trapped coins, you are making a love check to avoid falling for the king's daughter (who is actively trying to seduce you). This is a social thing. She wants you to do something and you don't wanna. Handle it via the social combat system. If you "give," then you fall in love with her.  Pitfall avoided.<br/><br/><b>Dualistic</b><br/>I still run afoul of this pitfall. There's no integration between physical combat and social combat. <br/><br/><b>PC Aura</b><br/>Avoided. Social combat works on PCs but doesn't force them to do anything.<br/><br/><b>Asshole</b><br/>Avoided. Being an asshole doesn't help you in social combat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daztur" title="Daztur"><img alt="Daztur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daztur">Daztur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110174/#Comment_110174" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-28T17:47:54+00:00" title="November 28, 2007  5:47PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>SotC mostly trusts negotiation and out-of-game interaction to parse out the problems you bring up, which you might consider a feature or a bug, depending on your tastes.</blockquote>\nYeah, I think the game I'll end up with will be a bit less meta than SotC.\n<blockquote><br/>* There's a process of determining if conflict stakes are valid, and people decide this conflict just couldn't happen.<br/>* The lawman character is built so that he can brush aside the intimidation, be it with Willpower or whatever.<br/>* There's a degree of flexibility regarding goal fulfillment, so that the lawman can lose the conflict but not give the lieutenant everything he wants.<br/><br/>So, ideally speaking, how will your system handle that, and why? </blockquote>\nWell there's a lot of stuff I want to run by my co-developer, (Dean Baker, he posts some on the Fate listserv) he's hellishly busy ATM but I'll be able to run by all the stuff that's been brought up on this thread by him soon...<br/>1. Don't think I'm going to use a DitV-style stake-setting system.<br/>2. Will probably be easy to build a lawman whose Resolve (to use the SotC equivalent) will be high enough to do so without spending willpower. We'll probably have around 15 skills and then players will have a couple shticks that would function a bit like SotC aspects but would be free to invoke and represent things that characters are good at that cut across skills and represent things that are more specific than skills. For example "Fearless Lawman" would be a great schtick. <br/>3. Think I'll go a version of noclue's idea there. I like it a lot.\n<blockquote>But not necessarily mechanically. For something like this, you'd do well to focus the text on advice for this situation, rather than try to mechanically state "this is a small compromise and this is a big compromise" or whathaveyou.</blockquote>\nYeah, this would require a good bit of GM calls.\n<blockquote>Say you have a fantasy game with fighters &amp; wizards -- pretty stock-issue, simple stuff. Willpower is useful for both: fighters can use it to push past the pain of his wounds to continue fighting, and wizards use their force of will to make magic happen. This stat is truly useful, in that it is directly linked to their schitcks &amp; talents. Add to that the option of being social armor, and then you have the following choice: "Do I give in and keep being a badass fighter/wizard, or do I block the results of the conflict at the cost of being so badass in the near future?"</blockquote>\nThis. This is exaclty what we're shooting for. Hopefully it will work out well.\n<blockquote>Player: I attack with Diplomacy. My net attack roll is 25. Does that beat his will defense?<br/>GM: Yup, roll damage.<br/>Player: Ok did 10 morale damage<br/>GM: OK, despite your crushing argument, the Duke does not concede to your request. You are filled with righteous indignation.

But it is nicely un-meta, which I'm shooting for...\n<blockquote>...so, what if they weren't morale points but experience points? </blockquote>\nSort of like Starwars d6 letting you use skill points for a one-time boost?\n<blockquote>I wrote a Social Conflict system for D20 System a month ago.</blockquote>\nOoooooh BaB for social stuff, I do like.
