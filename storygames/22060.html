It’s not the only problem with my proposal but that’s a big one.</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Rafu" rel="nofollow">Rafu</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I’d personally be much happier houseruling all damage to flat, fixed numbers, perhaps adjusted up or down for high or low margins on attack rolls.</p></div></blockquote><p>I can’t change that much or it’s no longer 5e; if I were to allow myself to make such changes I would’ve made them even <i>more</i> radical. But, as a thought experiment of doing what you propose (make a change bigger than I <b>can</b> do but smaller than I’d <b>want</b> to do) I’d rather house rule away the to-hit-roll, since that’s not really differentiated between classes, whereas damage is; fighters get more attacks, thieves get extra damage on sneak attack etc.</p><p>Like, if attacks are (unpredictably large) ticks on “death clock” until it’s time to strike, why this two-step process? Why so many zero rounds? 0, 0, 8, 0, 12, 23, 24, 0, 0, 4, 23… so weird. And, if that’s what I <i>wanted</i>, I could do that more easily by having a damage threshold; i.e. damage is counted as “max(0, roll-DT)”. The <abbr title="\">DT</abbr> could even be different for each pair of combatants, from some formula or table of defensive power vs offensive power. I don’t know… or maybe I wouldn’t make it a “death clock” mechanic at all, I’d resolve fights in some other way completely. More akin to the War Machine system in the Rule Cyclopedia; take fortune at the end to its extreme: put a bunch a factors in (through a narrative &amp; interesting process full of description &amp; detail &amp; interaction back and forth between SIS and rules) and then one roll to see who lives or dies, and if the survivor is left with any wounds.</p><p>But… back to 5e:</p><p>Sorry to be such a mindless follower / misinterpreter of <a href="/forums/profile/lumpley">@lumpley</a> but… I think the solution might be to find out better mappings of “dice” events to “cloud” events, and I’m hopeful since I stumbled on the idea of providing a “do you kill her?” prompt outside the normal turn order.</p><p>If we could find semantics for the “hits” vs “misses” that isn’t wounding/killing; such as “staggered”, “shocked”, etc… uh… I’m not good at coming up with good things. Not to add rules consequences to those semantics beyond what’s currently there: <abbr title="hit point">HP</abbr> loss.</p><p>Yeah, that’s what this is… me trying to keep the game’s original mechanics but changing the mapping between ‘dice’ and ‘cloud’. Not sure I’m doing a great job…</p><p>to start over; and unmap everything… here is the components we have here by the drawing board.</p><h2 id="dice-events">Dice events</h2><ul><li>Spending actions</li><li>Making attacks</li><li>Making many attacks (fighter)</li><li>Making attacks with high damage (rogue)</li><li>Rolling under the enemy’s AC</li><li>Rolling high or low damage</li><li>Rolling a natural 20</li><li>Enemy dies</li><li>Self dies</li></ul><h2 id="cloud-events">Cloud events</h2><ul><li>Time passes</li><li>Making attacks</li><li>Making many attacks (fighter)</li><li>Making focused and “particular” attacks (rogue)</li><li>Enemy is unfazed</li><li>Enemy is rattled</li><li>Enemy is wounded</li><li>Enemy dies</li><li>Self is wounded</li><li>Self dies</li></ul><h2 id="overloaded-troublesome-words">Overloaded / troublesome words</h2><ul><li>Hit</li><li>Miss</li><li>Damage</li></ul><p>I haven’t pitched my “Oh, Injury!” suggestion (posted above) to the group yet; and next session is probably going to be on on Saturday (our scheduled main day is Tuesday the 14th but we were talking about putting in some extra sessions on Saturday and Monday). So we still have some time to fix this.</p><p>The introduction of a new “prompt” seems great; such prompts are great tools for more control over the granularity (whether we want to tune it to be finer or coarser) of the mapping without messing with the turn order. The equivalent of “how do you want to do this?” in Critical Role. The introduction of a wound threshold, if I end up going that direction, is a bigger intrusion, especially with the Fate inspired “one time use of advantage” idea.</p><p>We can see right away that what we have in those two lists, “Dice events” and “Cloud events”, don’t map up well;<br/>it’s difficult to describe the dice events in a clear and interesting way and that isn’t inconsistent from player to player.</p><p>Ideally I’d want a carrot (how about a translucent dangling carrot) that affords/conveys a good mapping; the “wound” prompt bonus (adv/disadv) was my first attempt at that.</p><p>It doesn’t necessarily have to be the mapping that I originally proposed, it just has to be a mapping (of the existing mechanics, we can’t stop playing D&amp;D in the middle of the campaign) to something that does make more <em>sense</em> in the SIS.</p> </div>

<p>Reading the relevant chapter in Anima Prime rn. I found a 2011 CC edition of the game.</p><p><b>Edit:</b> Yeah, I want a similar flow; it’s all maneuvering until the final couple of strikes.</p><p>Their design tools aren’t the best; for example, reading the section on “Maneuver Descriptions”: rules for how you can and cannot describe. “Correct description” is something that I want the game to <i>create</i> rather than <i>rely on</i>.</p><p>Unfortunately, we can’t be too high&amp;mighty about that since we only have even weaker design tools available so far. We don’t even have a separate move list of maneuvering moves vs striking moves.

All that is not "hit, miss, damage,  apply effect", is bond to be maneuvering. It is fluff in a way, but no less important, because it is also fictional positioning. It is also a place for player mastery.

What I fear is that 5e already has a bazillion of disarms, parry, and shenaniganesque maneuvers and effects that will trouble the broth on top of it all.<br/><br/> </div>

                            Maybe there is a way of converting a spell in HP currency ("threat level" or something), so that the Ice ray could be used to frame an opponent the same way a martial maneuver would (substracting HP). That is totally what a "generic system" would do. That means one more number prepared on the sheet. <br/>With this abstraction in place, only in applying the effect would the nature of the attack matter. So that naming the proper effect (I chop him with my axe, pound her with my club, freeze it with my ray, etc.) could be enough to communicate the time when the player wishes to apply the effect. <br/><br/>I don't know about D&amp;D mechanics, maneuvering may not be as straight forward as piling up attacks. I suspect you need it because HP can go obscenely high. Maybe find a precedent in D&amp;D literature, maybe try with finer increments, maybe tolerate 3 misses before the player can't add anymore to the attack - so that missed rolls add to the dramaturgy of the fight. By all means, make the maneuvers benefit from teamwork. Maybe have a different system for ordinary skirmish and for boss fight.                        </div>

                            D&amp;D has always had this weird confusion/duality about what hit points mean: on one hand, it's an abstract "death clock", but, at the same time, it's supposed to represent physical toughness (e.g. wizards and small creatures have fewer hit points). This means that hitting someone with a bigger knife causes more "damage", but hitting someone with a poisoned knife means they make a saving throw or suffer a condition.<br/><br/>That's always going to cause problems, in my opinion, when aiming for a consistent handling of how this maps to the fiction. (As you point out yourself, the to-hit roll doesn't necessarily mean that anyone was hit or missed - a "miss" could be a strike that "didn't matter", especially when it missed because of heavy armour being worn, and a "hit" could be a missed blow that caused them to lose their balance... and the same goes for a damage roll - it could mean anything, with a rolled "1" killing your opponent and a rolled "32" just rattling them for a moment.)<br/><br/>One issue with your approach here is that there are, quite simply, fewer "blows landing" in this new revised vision of D&amp;D combat. Most D&amp;D groups take the opposite approach, where each successful attack roll IS some kind of strike that lands, making D&amp;D combat much more like a superhero fight than like a lightsaber duel. It seems that you're going for the latter, instead.<br/><br/>That means that all your enemies will feel like swift, skilled, hard-to-hit combatants, instead of like "tanks", and that doesn't always match what the game is trying to represent or recreate. That could be bad for drama, as well - I think of Boromir's death scene in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, for example: that kind of moment would never happen under this interpretation of the rules.<br/><br/>Since I know you watch <i>Critical Role</i>, I think it's a good example of what a "every blow lands" interpretation of D&amp;D looks like. Sometimes the mounting injuries can get a little unrealistic, but it's dramatic and memorable, as well.<br/><br/>What, in your mind, is the main drawback of this more "typical" interpretation of "mounting injuries"?<br/><br/>Another potential issue is a stance mismatch - for me, for instance, I wouldn't enjoy casting fireball and then choosing which three enemies die. It's anti-gloracular (to use your favourite term <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> ), choosing instead of finding out.<br/><br/>I really like the "wound threshold + temporary condition" effect; that's nice. It will give the players another advantage in fights, though, as you suggest. But that's a nice effect, and gives some depth to gameplay and the imagined fiction, which I dig.                        </div>

Indeed, in <i>Critical Role</i> (as in most D&amp;D games I've seen), every "hit" is considered a "hit" in the fiction, as well. Mercer tends to grimance and grunt when portraying the monsters, adding sound effects, describing gruesome wounds, and so forth. You would get the sense of it after 5-10 mins of watching a combat, if you want to see what I mean.<br/><br/>That works well for most people, but it's quite different stylistically from what you're describing. Not an obvious puzzle!

True - that's why I said it's only a "potential" issue. It might not come up very often, depending on how you want to handle it! <br/><br/>(In other words, I understand your intent in outlining the rules, it just runs the risk of feeling different in play, especially if I'm imagining swinging my sword at the monster's neck, then roll well enough to wound it, and my friend says, "Hey, it would be great to halve its movement rate right now...", so I end up trying to re-envision the whole scene so that I'm swinging at its leg. It's a subtle effect, though, maybe not bothersome for you.)

First of all, have you written about your mechanics for scheduling games? I'd love to see that! Always a challenge to get people together. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Second, you might want to reread my HP rule in your "fainting buffer" thread; they handle the specifics of HP and injury - exactly the way you suggest, with mostly misses and parries until the target gets down to their last quarter or so hit points - quite nicely, I think, and the fiction is always crystal clear.                        </div>

                            Ah, great! Yeah, we’re on the same page. (And I’ll come back to fix those quotes, thanks and sorry!) In the case of my suggested rule, not spending HP means you’re hit and you die, so you’d never WANT to do that; it happens only once you’re outmaneuvered.<br/><br/> The tiny tiny tiny issue I’m describing with these rules here is just what they used to call an IIEE thing back at the Forge - where does the dice roll happen relative to narration?<br/><br/>I’d have to train myself not to fully imagine the action my character is taking until after I’ve rolled to hit and damage, right? Not a huge deal at all, but just slightly different than all the more “Fortune at the End” rules in D&amp;D. <br/><br/>Or am I misunderstanding? It seems to me that I go “I roll to hit”, then roll damage, and the GM informs me that I hit well enough to wound, so NOW I decide that I’m chopping its leg. <br/><br/>D&amp;D has other rules that work this way, too, and sometimes I might have been imagining the swing just the way I wanted before I rolled, anyway. So it’s not a big deal at all. However, all of these rules for ammo expenditure and such tend to shift this dynamic in this very subtle way.<br/><br/>In comparison, other games with the “maneuver-maneuver-maneuver-strike” tend to have you decide WHEN you want to go for the strike before rolling the dice. That feels more like the character’s perspective to me, although admittedly it’s hardly that different. The other approach is to have the defender tell you whether you hit them or not (like in Dogs in the Vineyard), which is smooth and cool, and that’s what I was borrowing for my optional rule. (In this case I ALWAYS imagine my character swinging to kill, and the defender tells me if my blow lands or not, based on their remaining ability to get out of the way.)<br/><br/>I very much agree with your critique of FATE; it’s a similar subtle thing which might not matter to some people but could make a difference to others. This thread has made me realize why I also feel a little funny about the “shields be splintered” rules sometimes, so thank you for that!                        </div>

As I understand it... not quite like that. It's "Yes, And". You bludgeon your enemy "rolling to-hit", you do damage, the GM informs you that you hit well enough to wound so you get a free new extra bonus-plus action right now which you spend to do one of several things, so now you follow up your bludgeoning with chopping its leg while it's off balance so that it becomes slowed.                        </div>

                            Ah, yeah. That’s a good way to reconceptualize it - a sort of extra bonus action. It still “feels” funny to me, in a D&amp;D context, but that’s better. It might feel more in line with the other rules, perhaps, if it was written to be similar to the “coup de grace” rules:<br/><br/>“When you have an enemy at your mercy for a moment, you can choose to wound them for free. When you have an enemy completely at your mercy, you can deal a deadly blow, making them suffer a missed death check automatically.”<br/><br/>“An enemy who drops below their wound threshold is temporarily at the mercy of their attacker, due to being forced back or being thrown off guard.”<br/><br/>Or something with better wording, but bundled like that for consistency.<br/><br/>I kind of like the implication that you could let a teammate take the free action, instead, perhaps.                        </div>

The average chance of a non-undead/non-construct monster in the 5e SRD to make its morale roll (which means it keeps fighting) is 64% (I.e. selecting the “drive off” reward whiffs most of the time). With disadv, it’s 41%; still not great… but maybe making it easier than that to drive them off would leave 5e RAW too much.

It’s that weird hybrid of task- &amp; conflict- resolution that Torchbearer has. Not into it! (I use the “clarity” time scale zooming model instead.

The basic idea is simple:<br/><br/>The attacker makes a threatening move against the defender. The damage (measured in points) tells us how hard it is to avoid.<br/><br/>The defender now must decide what to do. They have to spend hit points if they don't want to die. <br/><br/>The way they spend them determines what happens in the fiction - they get hit but avoid most of the damage, they block/parry, or they daintily step out of the way. <br/><br/>This is my favourite part: tremendous clarity! We know exactly what to imagine and how that impacts the strategy and the fiction for the next move. <br/><br/>You say, "I swing at your head! 2 damage!". I say, "Ha! Easy. I spend 4 points, ducking and stepping to the side - I have advantage on my next attack now." <br/><br/>But later in the fight, , you roll better (and I have few hit points left), so you say, "I swing at your head again, but this time I've got the measure of you! 12 damage!" <br/><br/>That's bad for me - I only have 8 hit points left, so I can't block or avoid. But I can say, "I'll spend half that to take a minor injury - you leave a bleeding gash across my neck that will need tending later, and now I'm off-balance, at disadvantage, as I give ground." (All those things get interesting - if I'm at the edge of a cliff, maybe it means I fall off, hoping the fall won't kill me as surely as your sword. Or if your sword had some magic ability or poison, that would have been the wrong choice - it's a "soul stealing" sword, so it touching me activates that power, for instance.)<br/><br/>But even if I don't fall off a cliff or have my soul sucked out, I'm in trouble - I only have 4 points left, so the next time you attack me for 8 or more points, I'm dead. This time you'll chop my head off (or whatever 0 hp means at our particular table).<br/><br/>Does that help?

Oh, I think you have - it's right here, below. (But the target area doesn't matter - it's just colour, since this is D&amp;D. But we can chat about for fun fight choreography - "I swing at you, for 8 points!" - "Ooh, I think I can block that. Are you swinging down low, or coming down from above, like this?")<br/><br/>Anyway, the weirdness:

D&amp;D has this weird thing built-in where rolling to hit and rolling to damage is pretty redundant. So when you and I try to monkey with the process, it comes to the forefront: why are we bothering with a procedure which tends to create pointless/eventless empty "pacing" rounds?<br/><br/>It has to do with hit points serving double duty as a pacing mechanic and as "meat points" (representing physical injury). Ugh.<br/><br/>I think a good modern game shouldn't have that issue, but if we're working with D&amp;D, we have to grapple with that. In both mine and your alternate suggested rules, we get this redundancy and some pointless rolling, because of the underlying D&amp;D chassis.<br/><br/>You remember my "resist harm" move for Dungeon World? The idea was to have the same dynamic but without needing damage numbers for the attack - the idea is that it would be a similar dynamic, but with just a declaration of the attack/damage and then the roll/spend. (I never got to try it in a real game, though.)

Yeah! I like that with the Fudge dice - elegant. But you'd still have pacing rounds when you missed, wouldn't you? Probably best in an opposed-roll-winner-hits-loser kind of setup.<br/><br/>As for HP preventing you from being immediately ganked, that's true, but there are many other ways to do it! I got into a discussion with Vincent Baker once about how Apocalypse World needed to have hit points to give the PCs a "free hit" before they went down. So I designed a hit point-less system which still preserves that effect:<br/><br/><a href="http://ihousenews.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/63408904/Apocalypse%20harm.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://ihousenews.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/63408904/Apocalypse harm.pdf</a>

<p>So one of my design observations that I need to re-remember, maybe it’s not a big problem re this or maybe it needs some adjustment, but it’s the “clarity” principle: we tend to zoom in / out to whatever timescale, level of detail, level of description that’s the necessary to give us the answer strictly need.

In it, you start with 20 life; just like D&amp;D it’s a mix of meat point &amp; mind points &amp; maneuverability; in fact, spending HP is one of the only ways you yourself physically can fight. “I attack with four 3/3 mammoths” “I have a 4/4 boar… so you must have a trick up your sleeve, I’ll rather spend 12 to take the mammoths on myself, than risk my precious boar”</li><li>what I really love with this take is that high HP is another vector for competence, just like high AC is. Instead of “OK, you are staggered for 15 hp”, you can pay 15 hp to parry/avoid/clang etc.</li></ul><p>Some bad things:</p><ul><li>I don’t like the “haha you miss easily” double point spend; I want heroes and monsters to be competent; I want them to be able to feint &amp; be patient &amp; perceptive &amp; then… STRIKE!</li><li>one of the things you’re saying, Paul, is “You can choose to take an injury to halve the amount of HP you lose that round”, this bings us back to splintered shields &amp; stress-track consequences, which we didn’t really want, remember? (and yes, just like in those games, I get that you’d only do this when you more or less have to [if the injuries are harsh enough])</li><li>unless we have a co-DM, there’s no way to find out what the monsters would choose</li><li>the “spend various amounts of points” moves pretty far from the RAW / “balance”</li><li>when they have 4 and you deal 8, they go to zero; they’re not really spending anything; I get that in your game “they died with 4hp remaining” which isn’t wrong but requires a lot of tweaks to dying&amp;deathsaving rules over here [not unpossible, but listed among the cons]</li></ul> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>All those things get interesting - if I’m at the edge of a cliff, maybe it means I fall off, hoping the fall won’t kill me as surely as your sword.

<p>I still have two days to tinker &amp; tweak until next playtest, Tuesday, but just as a snapshot of where the work-in-progress stands this second:</p><ul><li>No spending double or half as per Paul’s system.</li><li>HP is lost/spent according to the normal resistances &amp; vulnerabilities in 5e</li><li>As per “Oh, Injury!”, but HP-loss can be described as spending HP to negate the attack</li><li>If being able to inflict wound effects is the carrot,</li><li>having the HP spend negation reflect the attack in the SIS is the stick.</li></ul><p>Maneuver, be careful, aim, look for or create openings, and then you are rewarded with opportunities to bring the ever-lovin’ ruckus. Chop wildly &amp; prematurely and the monsters will spend HP to counter.</p><p>uh<br/>I just thought of something.</p><p>This is something I can start doing:</p><p>“Alice, the four tomb dwarves has their crossbows aimed <em>right at you</em>, what do you do?”<br/>“I shoot one of them!”<br/>“You don’t try to defend yourself? Roll a lingering injury as the arrows fly toward you.”</p><p>I can’t believe I never realized this before in my past attempts to look at AW/DW. Inflict harm! <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23cruella&amp;Mode=like">#cruella</a></p><p>“Alice, the four tomb dwarves has their crossbows aimed <em>right at you</em>, what do you do?”<br/>“Oh, I hold up my shield!”<br/>“Make eight defense rolls DC 14, six damage each”<br/>“I made three of the rolls, but I can afford six”<br/>“You see that the arrows glisten of poison; there’s also a con save DC 10 for 1d4.”<br/>“I made the save”<br/>“OK, they’re holding steady but they don’t see a window past your shield, what do you do?”</p><p>“Alice, the tomb dwarves has that crossbow aimed <em>right at you</em>, what do you do?”<br/>“Oh, I hold up my shield!”<br/>“Make eight defense rolls DC 14, six damage”<br/>“Eight? They have multiattack? I’m definitely dodging.” <em>[taking the Dodge action]</em><br/>“They see that they can’t get a clear shot in and shift their bows over to you, Bob. What do you do?” <em>[DM turned to Bob]</em></p><p>Also, when the players prematurely attack someone that has “first strike” on them, I need to start going:</p><p>“I attack the Full Metal Frankenstein with my short sword!”<br/>“Oh, he’s definitely ready for you, Alice, swiping your sword to the side and pulling his fist back; you’re staring right into his white knucks, what do you do?”</p><p>(without the player even getting to make an attack roll, don’t worry, my “keeping track of the action econ” system will ensure that the player will get to make all the attacks [and other actions] that are due to them.)</p><p>Cary my hero♥♥♥</p><p>This is gonna be awesome</p><p>And all of this makes “maneuvering” and “aiming” <em>super</em> valuable in the SIS. Uh, as “super” valuable as something can be while having zero mechanical impact or zero impact on the outcome of the conflict as a whole. Only how it’s colored. Which, uh… bringing it back to the first paragraph of this post might mean that it starts to fall away <img alt=":bawling:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/bawling.png" title=":bawling:"/><br/>We’ll see!</p><p>Btw here is the “maneuvering” take on the exact same action exchange:</p><p>“I’m eying that Full Metal Frankenstein, trying to circle him”<br/>“In the flickering light of Bob’s lantern it’s pretty clear to you, Alice, that he’ll smash you to bits if you even come close; what do you do?”</p><p>Exact same mechanical outcome: the player will have to defend before attacking [at the same numbers&amp;consequences]; but the second hobo comes across as as cool, calculating, controlled, where the first hobo came across as making a mistake.</p><p>Hold on, it’s <em>not</em> the exact same mechanical outcome; it’s better; because if Bob joins up and they go over there together and Bob has control over where the lantern shines, they can get in the first swing! (It’s possible that they come up with that plan in either scenario <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23playerskill&amp;Mode=like">#playerskill</a> or it’s possible that they even with the second narration don’t come up with the plan, but the second narration makes it <em>slightly</em> more likely, rewarding them for “maneuvering”.</p><p>That wasn’t even me trying for that intentionally. That’s just the life-changing magic of fictional positioning in the <abbr title="shared imagined space">sis</abbr>.</p><p>I really haven’t been taking advantage of the “action counting” to the extent that I could!</p> </div>

My posts are attempts at strong arguments for discovering what and how Mythic Bricolage/Semiotic Jazz works in role-play and while attempting to legitimizing said modes of play as a legitimate CA.<br/><br/>That you want to take it apart and find what works or doesn't work for <i>you</i> is totally awesome!  Our game got to where it is doing the same thing.  To be honest it's still under "development" right now.  FREX - as the west coast group has played long enough that a fair number of players have a fair number of high level characters in our folders the DM is concerned that these high level characters have it too easy.  He didn't have any data points before, but now...<br/><br/>The one thing he doesn't seem to take into account, because he hasn't played in about 20 or so years, is that when a high level character commits to combat the stakes for the player are way higher than with a low level character.  It can take a decade or more or play to get to 10th level.  That's a lot of emotional investment.  My high level character might be more effective in combat on the whole but there are always those lurking "1's" and arrows are the great levelers.  Arrows (and knives) by pass stamina and do straight PBP which means a high level character is just as vulnerable as a low level character when hit by such weapons.  Granted a high level character is harder to hit but being hit by such a weapon is just as deadly to either high or low level character - except with the high level character we as players have 10+ years of real world time riding on the line.  So the discussion goes on.<br/><br/>Apologies if I derailed your thread.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            Pretty much.  Our exact term of art is "Personal Body Points" but I find your phrasing closer to the actual idea.  The idea is that while Stamina goes up with level PBP is the character's physicality which does not change.<br/><br/>If I recall the story properly the DM wanted to make certain events deadly and scary for the players no matter how good their character is.  Arrows are LETHAL.  Knife fights are LETHAL.  Fall off a cliff, don't care if you are 1st or 20th level those rocks below are going to be LETHAL.<br/><br/>EDIT - The cliff example was so that high level characters couldn't exploit the HP system and jump off a cliff, take a 100 HP's, dust themselves off and walk away thus avoiding something worse or just getting around an obstacle (the cliff) in a manner that clashed with how the Setting worked.<br/><br/>That kind of stuff.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            Ah, I see! I read your double post, and bits of it make total sense (for instance, removing half and double HP spend, if speed is the goal), and others confuse me. (I can go through them, if you want!) Mostly, I agree, though, if I'm understanding you correctly.<br/><br/>I'll throw out a few examples, anyway:
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>Some bad things:</p><ul><li>I don’t like the “haha you miss easily” double point spend; I want heroes and monsters to be competent; I want them to be able to feint &amp; be patient &amp; perceptive &amp; then… STRIKE!</li></ul></div></blockquote>
Most of your issues and points here (both good and bad) really come down to how you narrate the actions, not the mechanics themselves. For instance, in this case it's not a problem if you simply describe it differently. It's not "haha you miss easily", it's "you do your best, but you just can't get past his guard. Moments later, the tempo has shifted, he's forcing you back on your heels, and you can tell you're now on the defensive. What are you going to do now?"<br/><br/>This can work the same way regardless of whether you're describing actual attacks or maneuvering, as I'll describe below.<br/><br/>When you say "I want heroes and monsters to be competent", unless you're talking about literally describing things that happen as being stupid or mistakes (which, you know - just don't do that!), I think you're making a logical error. There's no way to make both sides seem cool and competent at all times - one contradicts the other. Someone has to be better now and then, which makes their opponent seem less competent. This shows up in many of your examples, by the way!<br/><br/>For instance:
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Also, when the players prematurely attack someone that has “first strike” on them, I need to start going:<br/><br/>“I attack the Full Metal Frankenstein with my short sword!”<br/>“Oh, he’s definitely ready for you, Alice, swiping your sword to the side and pulling his fist back; you’re staring right into his white knucks, what do you do?”<br/><br/>(without the player even getting to make an attack roll, don’t worry, my “keeping track of the action econ” system will ensure that the player will get to make all the attacks [and other actions] that are due to them.)<br/><br/>Cary my hero♥♥♥<br/><br/>This is gonna be awesome</p></div></blockquote>
That's a cool narration, but definitely makes the PC look less-than-competent, right (at least by your definition)?<br/><br/>I've never had a problem with this, because it's the monster's competence which is highlighted, not the PC's incompetence. It's narrations like "you go to strike the beast, swing, and stick your sword into the ground" which make you feel like an idiot (and a lot of people do this when they play D&amp;D). On the other hand, "you come in swinging, quick as lightning, but the monster's even faster than you are!" just makes me feel like, "wow, this enemy is badass! Better rethink my strategy". I don't think that makes the "hobo" (your vocabulary is catchy!) look like a fool at all. <br/><br/>There is no way to make a monster seem really scary and intimidating without making the hobos seem a little less competent.<br/><br/>Another example:
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>“I’m eying that Full Metal Frankenstein, trying to circle him”<br/>“In the flickering light of Bob’s lantern it’s pretty clear to you, Alice, that he’ll smash you to bits if you even come close; what do you do?”<br/><br/>Exact same mechanical outcome: the player will have to defend before attacking [at the same numbers&amp;consequences]; but the second hobo comes across as as cool, calculating, controlled, where the first hobo came across as making a mistake.<br/><br/>Hold on, it’s not the exact same mechanical outcome; it’s better; because if Bob joins up and they go over there together and Bob has control over where the lantern shines, they can get in the first swing! (It’s possible that they come up with that plan in either scenario <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23playerskill&amp;Mode=like">#playerskill</a> or it’s possible that they even with the second narration don’t come up with the plan, but the second narration makes it slightly more likely, rewarding them for “maneuvering”.<br/><br/>That wasn’t even me trying for that intentionally. That’s just the life-changing magic of fictional positioning in the sis.</p></div></blockquote>
It's definitely better, agreed. The difference, though, has nothing to do with "attacking vs. maneuvering". It's two entirely unrelated things:<br/><br/>1. It's simple IIEE. In the first example, the player is forced to commit to their action before they know about the "first strike". In this second example, you tell her (I think you're talking to Alice!) about the "first strike" and <i>only then</i> ask her if she wants to reconsider her action. That's why she comes across like she's making a mistake in the first example, but not the second example - you're given her more information before she makes the decision (after the first "I" instead of the second "I", in other words).<br/><br/><small>It's kind of weird, because you're also then going to be giving them another action later (and the dice don't get rolled just yet), but either way, the <i>fictional</i> description has them committing to something while being unaware of an important piece of information.</small><br/><br/>2. The thing about the lantern light, similarly, has nothing to do with maneuvering vs. attacking. In the first example, you don't mention it at all. In the second, you explicitly say that it's the reason for the "first strike", giving the players a chance to attempt a strategy in reaction.<br/><br/>If I rewrite your example like so, you can see that it's your GMing that makes the difference, not what the rules are doing or how the player is announcing her action:
<blockquote>“I attack the Full Metal Frankenstein with my short sword!”<br/>“In the flickering light of Bob’s lantern it’s pretty clear to you, Alice, that he’ll smash you to bits if you even come close; are you sure that's what you want to do?”</blockquote>
Same thing - the player isn't making a mistake, and they can strategize about the lantern now, if they want.<br/><br/>Similarly:
<blockquote>“I’m eying that Full Metal Frankenstein, trying to circle him”<br/>“Oh, you circle him but he’s definitely ready for you, Alice, swiping your sword to the side and pulling his fist back; you’re staring right into his white knucks, what do you do?”</blockquote>
The player is caught off-guard, their character made an error, and they know nothing about the lantern. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>In AW terms, you're making different MC moves. In the first case, it's all "tell them the consequences and ask", and in the second it's "announce future badness".                         </div>

You're absolutely right! That's a challenge. I guess you could simplify the system for them (they always "choose" the same thing), and leave the choices to the players. But it sounds like you're going to leave the choices out altogether , so it's probably not an issue. I support that, for speed and simplicity! Good idea, most likely.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>Normal soul stealing swords in 5e worx like this:</p><p>if they crit against someone with 100 hp or less, they have to con save (dc 15) or die (unless they are construct or undead)</p></div></blockquote>
That's exactly the sort of contrived rule D&amp;D needs to have to get around the nature of abstract hit points (it's basically mandating that yes, you do get hit any time there's a critical, so long as you have fewer than 100 HP, which means the hit points no longer work as "death clock" under those exceptional circumstances, breaking down their purpose - and does this generalize to other attacks? No idea... no clarity). <br/><br/>Having a system like I'm describing, though, obviates the need for such complex rules! Now "I don't have enough hit points left to avoid the attack" is the only way you get soul-drained, and we no longer need a special case of a rule about critical rolls and how many HP you have left - it's a natural outcome of the basic system, instead. <br/><br/>What's even better is that it becomes a tactical consideration, making the game more interesting for the players: now it makes a big difference whether you know about the sword's abilities or not! You have to decide whether to risk having it touch you.  In regular D&amp;D, you have no choice to make; it's just about the d20 roll, which decides for you. You knowing that it exists or not basically doesn't change your combat options at all. <br/><br/>Under something like these rules, though, being more scared of the sword makes a dramatic difference, which I think is really cool. (Because I'll want to spend more HP to stay safe from it.) I benefit from my improved knowledge in a clearer and easier way.<br/><br/>Now you don't need any special rules for poison or soul-stealing any more: it's reflected in the way players spend their HP to avoid that attack! Very elegant. Much more elegant than "if they crit against someone with 100 hp or less, they have to con save (dc 15) or die (unless they are construct or undead)" - instead, it's "if the thing touches you, make a Con save (DC 15) or die", which is both more intuitive and more interesting, as well as easier to remember and adjudicate. (In "normal" D&amp;D, what the hell happens if you just let the attacker stab you with the soul-stealing sword, but they don't get to roll at all, or they roll but don't roll a crit, or a rule indicates that they hit automatically, for instance? Not obvious.)<br/><br/><small>(I mentioned this in the other thread, but in case it's been forgotten: I don't think the numbers I came up with, especially the 1/2 and x2, are actually right for this. It was just a proof of concept. Realistically it should be something more like [damage -1 per die to take a minor flesh wound/graze], [straight damage to block or parry], and [damage +1 per die to avoid the attack altogether]. But even that isn't right, because D&amp;D isn't consistent with how it determines damage - similar weapons could be rated 1d10+1 or 2d6, for example - and it depends on the edition being used. It would take some thinking. The idea is just that you spend more HP to avoid attacks you're particularly scared of - that's the basic principle - and can try to spend less when you're confident you're going to win, but you risk being overconfident and falling prey to poison, magical effects, losing ground or position, suffering disadvantage, or whatever else we want to highlight tactically.</small>

An idea: you could fix all three things easily. Here's a good "middle ground" between your rules and my proto-idea:<br/><br/>You no longer choose. Instead, if just happens when you go below your "wound limit" (or "fainting limit", or whatever you were calling it). You take a wound and if there was poison or soul-stealing or whatever, that's when it happens! <br/><br/>So:<br/><br/>* Someone attacks you or maneuvers for an opening (again, it doesn't matter). Describe the attack/maneuver and the amount of damage/threat points.<br/>* If you can spend that number of points, you've avoided the attack. You're safe, but you're getting tired/worn down (or whatever you think HP loss represents, if anything).<br/>* If you can spend that number of points, but it takes you below your "wound limit", you've been physically hit by the attack, but it's nothing too serious. It's a light wound/flesh wound/scratch/graze/minor non-lethal injury. [Apply poison/magical effects here, collect Inspiration, etc - and you could remove your "lingering injuries" rule here, since activating those effects could be sufficiently bad to encourage people to keep their "limit" low. But I like the idea that someone who often gets "bloodied" in combat and risks getting poisoned gets Inspiration!]<br/>* If you can't spend that many points, it's a mortal/lethal wound (use normal rules here).<br/>* A mortally wounded character has 0 HP, by definition (since they can't defend themselves).<br/> <br/>That's pretty elegant, I think! And it gives us that clarity I like. <br/><br/><small>Some fun stuff with this ruleset:<br/><br/>We can now have a "to first blood" duel in D&amp;D! That's nifty. (And risky, because, just like in real life, you can try all you want, but it's still possible you'll kill your opponent by accident.)<br/><br/>If you like the idea of being Wolverine - the guy who ends the battle with five arrows sticking out of him - you can give yourself a high wound limit and rake in the Inspiration!<br/><br/>If you want to incentivize high "wound limits" further: when a character with 0 HP is revived, wakes up, comes to consciousness, or whatever, they immediately go to their "wound limit". So, if my "wound limit" is 4 and yours is 1, if we both fall, wounded, but make our death saves and get back up, I get up with 4 HP and you get up with 1 HP. I kinda like that distinction!</small><br/><br/>What this really does is <i>move the decision point for when you get hit from the moment of combat all the way back to character creation</i>. (But gives us the advantage of simplicity and speed, in return.)                        </div>

I'm not sure I understand! Why are "empty rounds" necessary in task resolution? Something like "both sides roll to hit, winner hits loser" is task resolution but doesn't have any empty rounds.                        </div>

It turns it from a shopping list of options into <em>one action</em> (avoiding badness) that happens to cost a variable amount of points depending on the level of that badness.</p><h2 id="poison">Poison</h2><p>Like it or not <small>(and if not, we have 0e where it’s all 1d6 all the time [before supplements], which was great but too big of a change for what I can do rn)</small>, a longbow arrow costs 1d8+3 points to “avoid” and a sling bullet costs 1d4+3 points to avoid; and the different damage types means that your resistances or vulnerabilities matter; a sling bullet is much more dangerous to a skeleton (b/c bludg vuln) than a longbow arrow is!. Sling bullets certainly aren’t any <em>easier</em> to avoid than arrows (the ease of avoidance being based, instead, on both your armor and your dexterity, both of which combine into the defense roll we use); it’s just that it costs more to avoid more dangerous things!</p><p>Hit points being some kind of, uh, divine luck points or, well, “death clock”. You hang around arrows &amp; poisons &amp; flame and stuff, well, death clock gonna tick faster than if you lead a quiet life only having to dodge the occasional sling bullet.</p><p>Therefore, a poison arrow costs 1d8+3+1d4 HP to avoid; the poison 1d4 you can ignore if you are good enough at making DC 10 con saves so that the poison wouldn’t be dangerous to you anyway.</p><h2 id="iiee">IIEE</h2> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>It’s simple IIEE.</p></div></blockquote><p>It’s IIEE.

                            Ok. I think I followed about half of that. Part of the problem is that I don’t know if you’re describing “they way things are” or “the way I want/plan to do things” (like with that diagram, which I’m tempted to say I disagree with entirely). I seem to be assuming one, and then you respond that it’s the other. That makes this tricky.<br/><br/>What I *did* get is that you want to formalize responding to a maneuver with “here’s some more description and maybe an opportunity or a question” and a “brash” “attack” with “the monster strikes back”.<br/><br/>(I pointed out that you don’t have to do it that way, and you responded with, “yeah, but that’s how I want to do it.” Ok! Why not.)<br/><br/>If that’s what you’re doing, why would I ever describe making an attack? Mechanically they’re identical, if I understand correctly, but one gets a much nicer response from the GM and no danger to me.<br/><br/>I could see it working, perhaps, if I had to *save up* all that damage and it only got applied when I made an actual attack. (So if I spend three rounds maneuvering and then I get knocked unconscious, the monster is still at full HP.) but I’m pretty sure that’s not at all what you’re suggesting.<br/> </div>

The “aim point” / “charge point” system from a few weeks ago did work more similar to that, but this system doesn’t.<br/>That system was cool but created <em>more</em> conflation between “death clock points” and “meat points”.</p><p>It also had another big problem:</p><p>Since some battles in D&amp;D are team affairs, you’d want to be able to team up several people to make maneuver vs an enemy until it could be wounded and killed!</p><p>Maybe Alice, Bob and Carol harry the monster from the the front making it so that Ted stab its legs from the back, wounding it!</p><p>(Some monsters could have the keyword “Behemoth” [this isn’t a RAW 5e thing, just an idea] where they had several wound thresholds so they could be hurt many times.

Festering wounds can also be treated over ten successful Wisdom checks (once chance per day). (That’s difficult, but since any healing magic also does the trick, that wound type isn’t so bad.)

<p>Clarification on the Wolverine thing:</p><p>The trigger is when you cross the treshold, not when you move further down when already under the threshold.</p><p>So you’re a bad-ass when having a high <abbr title="wound threshold">WT</abbr> because you <em>can stay up and fight</em> longer after you’ve been hurt.

If the wound limit is high, chances are that you can stay under it for a while and not rack up new wounds.</li></ul> </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> You are totally reinventing my game : fiction fiction fiction, only, at the end player dead or not. So they can take advantage of the interim to build and mold the way they're going to die or kill. Makes lots of room for aesthetic vision and "expression" (Princess playing), lots of anti-absurdum control.<br/><br/>No amount of rules can prevent people from going "I kill the sheriff". <br/><br/>The "Not yet !" rule in Capes prevents sudden Sherrif death. Note that you can also teach it a la Capes : the adversary seemed to hurt, but finds some energy to... or it was a feint and ... As you see, this goes into narrative territory. You'll still have to teach that. But chances are you're going to get something better than the atrocious dance of "mother may I begin to Intend ?"

                            Sandra,<br/><br/>Don't worry! I'm not annoyed or anything. I just got very confused by all the tangents and mixture of "current rules" with hypothesizing and so forth. I couldn't tell what was you explaining things and what was you suggesting possibilities and what was you pointing out issues with my suggestions. For instance, now I finally understand why you were talking about carrots and sticks - it's about player behaviour, not diegetics or game mechanics. Now I get it! It seems I was a bit dense. :P<br/><br/>Hilarious how I ended up sort of reproducing your system. Ha! Sorry about that.<br/><br/>I still find it odd that you're so concerned with the PCs "not looking dumb" but willing to use a "stick" when a player describes an attack. (I understand that it's the player, in the second case, who made the "error", not the character, but it's still the character who ends looking "dumb" or at least "slow" in the fiction - and, in my opinion, worse - dumber, in other words - than in the standard case of "the monster parried your attack".)<br/><br/>Anyway, it sounds like you've settled on something, so that's good.<br/><br/>I have a few minor comments, and then I'll leave it at that:<br/><br/>1. I think D&amp;D shoots itself in the foot with the way attacks, hit points, and special abilities all interface. It just roughly holds together in the "standard" interpretation (all hits are actual "hits" in the fiction - bam! pow!), which is kind of like a superhero fight: lots of brutal powers and attacks landing, but no one actually gets killed or seriously hurt (until the end, anyway). As you start to remap those things, the flaws and problems come out, as they are doing here.<br/><br/>If you use the "wound limit = hit, but not lethally" and "0 HP = lethally wounded" rules, the ideal solution would be to rewrite all those powers, spells, and effects so they interface with that.<br/><br/>Basically, casting a spell or breathing fire or any of those things threaten to finish the fight (just like swinging your sword), but someone with HP remaining can avoid that fate.<br/><br/>Therefore, any such ability or power should have a "damage". For instance, you cast Mind Control on your foe, it "does" "20 damage". Pay that many hit points, and you shrug it off.<br/><br/>However, each power also has an effect at "wounded" and another at "dead". Mind Control, perhaps, imposes disadvantage on everything you do until you make a saving throw (if it gets to your wound limit), or makes you a puppet of your opponent (at 0 HP). Stuff like that.<br/><br/>For weapons, it's "lingering injury" at the wound limit and "mortally wounded" at 0 HP. For other abilities and powers, it's "minor effect" and "full effect", for that ability.<br/><br/>So those attacks, as befits the "genre", can be fired off and get shrugged off, over and over, until the final one or two end the fight. (The "fainting buffer" gives the opponent a chance to surrender before they're done for good.)<br/><br/>2. I prefer my variation on the wound limit, where you can take multiple wounds. More dramatic and more interesting! Some people love to play Wolverine, and it adds cool tension to fights, too. (But it does depend on what rules you're using for those wounds; I'd be fine with them just being cosmetic, too.)<br/><br/>3. Interesting to see that "lingering wounds" table. I can't say I love it, but the minor risk of serious injury is at least potentially intriguing. The idea of gaining Inspiration just to spend <i>on the injury roll</i> itself is kind of lame, though, in my opinion. For anyone who has tokens piled up, it just means it drains their stockpile, for instance, and it has no effect on the fight itself. <br/><br/>Hard to pass up that 12.5%-ish chance difference on losing a limb! I don't know. Maybe you're already using it and it's working out great in play...<br/><br/>Also, isn't getting Inspiration part of the reason you'd want to have a high wound limit? In that case, it needs to be good for something other than avoiding the wound you've just signed up to suffer...<br/><br/>4. You occasionally use the acronym DSF - I have no idea what that is!<br/><br/>5. I like your technique of looking for diegetic responses to "incorrect declarations" as opposed to just saying it's "wrong". That's a smart thing to look for, and I understand what you're going for now.<br/><br/>6.

This is very insightful! A good analysis.<br/><br/>7. Overall, I like a lot of this, but the "roll to maneuver" business sounds like it would be awkward and un-fun to me. Of course, I'd have to try it, and maybe some people will love it, but that's my hunch. For instance, some things that could feel funny:<br/><br/>For starters, now instead of "rolling to swing a sword at your enemy" you're "rolling to get the GM to tell you that you get to hurt the monster now". Killing the monster is cool and all, but "well done, you get to hurt the monster now, just not kill it" feels a little like a "mother may I" interaction. <br/><br/>The timing of dice and rolls seems to place the suspense/tension and the fictional causes in the wrong places sometimes.<br/><br/>For example, I've never seen an action movie where the Orcs draw their bows, point them at one enemy, then see they can't get a shot, so they point them at another enemy, and repeat. Are they just standing there, aiming (and could be for many rounds)? No, we've got arrows flying and bouncing of peoples' shields and everyone is screaming! <br/><br/>Same thing when two swordsmen are fighting - all those blows are potentially killing ones, they just can't get through defenses. <br/><br/>It's no different in "calmer" fiction (e.g. Tolkien's fight/battle scenes, at the opposite extreme of the spectrum from an action flick).<br/><br/>(Sidenote: perhaps it would work well if there were different *types* of maneuvers which matteres - maneuvering for position vs. trying to drive your opponent back, stuff like that.)<br/><br/>As another example, this is weird:<br/><br/>"The Orcs draw their bows but don't fire yet. 14 damage, including the poison you can see. Roll a Con save."<br/>-&gt; Strange that PC knows about the poison already (dramatically speaking, a wasted opportunity - no suspense or uncertainty; similarly, it's knowledge that would normally affect future decisions - am I worried about the poison - but, instead, it's already in the past mechanically even though nothing has happened yet diegetically).<br/>-&gt; Strange that the PC now makes a Con save - what does this even represent? They're feeling super healthy today, so now they're not as scared of the arrows... even though they haven't even left the bows yet? On a failure, they have a... future sense that the poison will be bad for them if the Orcs do fire?<br/><br/>And what if I'm a 'berserker' raging into battle, or a desperate warrior trying to save their dying child, acting all irrational? Or I'm fighting a horde of zombies or a swarm of bees? Or trying desperately to swing at an invisible foe? Surely none of those are going to be all "here I am, maneuvering, trying to line up the perfect shot"?<br/><br/>None of it is terrible or game-breaking, but a lot of the details sound strained and odd to me. Overall, not convinced it's better than D&amp;D as-is (with all the awkwardness that has).<br/><br/>Definitely worth trying and reporting back on, however! It's been a pretty fascinating conversation and I think it's great stuff to be thinking about and experimenting with.                        </div>

We’re brash, we take risks!</p><p>By saying “OK I do a shortsword attack” they mean “I want to dance with deeeaaaath!!!!”</p><p>By saying “I shoot with my bow” they mean “I don’t mind if I waste arrows or if I miss”</p><p>Instead of me trying to be the hobo’s mom and take care of them and make them always look competent… I can go wild! “The skeleton can pay 4 hp easily and the arrow just slides straight through the ribcage hitting the dungeon wall behind”.</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>I think D&amp;D shoots itself in the foot with the way attacks, hit points, and special abilities all interface. It just roughly holds together in the “standard” interpretation (all hits are actual “hits” in the fiction - bam! pow!), which is kind of like a superhero fight: lots of brutal powers and attacks landing, but no one actually gets killed or seriously hurt (until the end, anyway). As you start to remap those things, the flaws and problems come out, as they are doing here.</p></div></blockquote><p>Right, or my previous example with a slasher movie with bloody stab after bloody stab.

There’s also three other adjacent &amp; appealing uses: fighting the enemy, defending against the enemy, or on the (probably impending if you have a low wound threshold) death save.

                            Looks good to me, Sandra. <br/><br/>Two things:<br/><br/>1. One of the reasons I was trying to build some choice into HP spend was to make it less of an “empty” beat. Otherwise, it’s easier to just subtract the points and move on. (But maybe that’s ok!)<br/><br/>2. There is no real meaningful difference between a successful defense roll and an HP spend in this system. But that’s not your fault! That’s what D&amp;D does already. <br/><br/>E.g. “I hit you for 10 damage!” “I spend 10 HP, which means I step out of range at the last minute. You never hit me after all!”<br/><br/>Vs.<br/><br/>“I missed my attack roll, darn.” “Yeah, but you missed because of my high AC, which is from my armour, so that means you did actually hit me - clang!”<br/><br/>Silly; but that’s how the game is set up.                        </div>

Not saying there can’t be other reasons, if they are I’ll deal with them as I find them. #CasualGödel</p><p>So to start with, the intended normal response from me to Alice saying “I step back and avoid its spear” is to either demand a defense roll or an HP spend. That’s the baseline.</p><h1 id="when-they-dont-have-enough-actions-to-do-it">When they don’t have enough actions to do it</h1><p>Unlike <a href="https://www.urverkspel.com/kutulu" rel="nofollow">Kutulu</a>, in <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/introducing-late-night-fighting/" rel="nofollow">Introducing late night fighting</a>, defending doesn’t cost actions in the tally. So for this one, let’s use another example: Alice says “I step forward and jam my spear into it” when they don’t have enough actions in the “dice” to trigger an attack roll. That’s my queue to be the Time Master and make things go quickly and either narrate how other monsters act, or prompt other hobos to act, before Alice has the time to do so. (This is gonna be super difficult! Why do I make rules that are difficult to use <img alt=":bawling:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/bawling.png" title=":bawling:"/>)</p><p>I say:</p><p>“Faster than lightning he grabs ahold of your spear and holds it with his left hand as he slashes his <em>[turn to Bob]</em> sword at Bob; Bob, what do you do?”</p><h1 id="when-they-dont-have-enough-hp-to-do-it">When they don’t have enough HP to do it</h1><p>I say:</p><p>“Make an injury roll.”</p><p>Let’s say it comes up arm, I then say:</p><p>“You avoid the first stab but she makes another stab and this one gashes deep into your arm and you drop your sword as the arm goes numb. It’s almost eerily painless and the first thing you see is…. why is this spear so <em>red</em>.<i>[Turn to Carol]</i> Carol, you see the door open and…”</p><h1 id="when-they-dont-roll-well-enough-to-do-it">When they don’t roll well enough to do it</h1><p>Negate the orig defense, initate/offer a chance to do the “second line” defense (spending HP).</p><p>I say:</p><p>“Step back?

Narrating a single step back ain’t nothing so let’s use the example:</p><p>“I swing my sword as hard as I ever-lovin’ can, tryna knock it’s sword out of its hand”</p><p>This triggers Disarm: monster defends with strexterity instead of AC.<br/>I say:</p><p>“Roll an attack roll, vs 12 instead of the normal 13.”</p><h1 id="when-they-are-encrouching-on-a-codified-move-in-the-game-that-they-cant-do">When they are encrouching on a codified move in the game (that they <em>can’t</em> do)</h1><p>Just narrate them failing it. Narrating a single step back ain’t nothing so let’s use the example:</p><p>“I run up on the wall and run along the wall to get to the other goblin”</p><p>Running on the wall is reserved for monks level 9 or higher, or “Spider Climb” spell.</p><p>Just let them fail. I say:</p><p>“You take one step and then you fall prone on your back. The skeleton is over you, and her sword is coming down hard and fast, what do you do?”</p><h1 id="when-their-description-triggers-another-codified-move-in-the-game">When their description triggers another codified move in the game</h1><p>Just trigger it. Normally a single step back would be just color but let’s say I’m interpreting it as actually moving out of the reach of the skeleton. That triggers <abbr title="opportunity attack">OA</abbr> so I’d say</p><p>“When you move that far back, the skeleton can stab at you again without having to fear your sword; his spear is lunging towards you again, what do you do?”</p><h1 id="when-the-specific-unusual-circumstances-in-the-sis-preventing-them">When the specific unusual circumstances in the SIS prevents them</h1><p>If there’s like a precipice or a wall behind them, incorporate that into the answer. I can respond to their description in a negating (it doesn’t work for their intented action [in this case, defending against a spear] or in an affirming way [it works to defend the spear, but it has other consequences]. I’m going to have to decide on which I should try to primarily use.</p><p>Here is what the negating answer would look like in the wall variant:</p><p>“SLAM! The wall was closer to you than you thought and you can’t get back as far as you thought; the spear is just about to skewer you, what do you do?”</p><p>Both the wall &amp; the precipice variants can handle the affirming answer, here’s the wall variant first:</p><p>“Bump, you hit the wall behind you and slide slightly to the side, narrowly avoiding the spear. <em>[Turn to Carol]</em> Meanwhile, Carol, you…</p><p>And the precipice variant:</p><p>“You take a step back and you avoid the spear but you suddenly feel no ground under your foot, what do you do?”</p><p>Leading into a dex save if they try to keep their balance or a strength save to see they can hold on. The principle “precede every unestablished roll with a soft move + ‘what do you do’” is new, we’ll see how it works. I’m gonna have to retrain myself (and my beloved dork crew) that instead of saying “Make a dex save”, say the Initatiation and ask what they do.</p><p><small>(Sidebar: the “affirming” variant of the wall bump is actually more blocking in some ways; it changed what they said that they were trying to do. I think instead of looking at it as negating/affirming, I should just say what happens in the <abbr title="shared imagined space">SIS</abbr>.)</small></p><h1 id="when-its-something-they-just-cant-do">When it’s something they just can’t do</h1><p>Like, if they describe super powers they just don’t have.</p><p>Just narrate them failing it.

It’s much more solid than you expected. Make an injury roll.” <em>[skipping over “the three gates” since she didn’t defend herself properly]</em></p> </div>

<p>First of all, <i>great</i>! I didn’t think it’d get this good this fast! (BTW you were absolutely right that many maneuvers are&amp;shouldbe actually direct tries to murder right then and there!!) Having the flexibility to choose actually ended up good!</p><p>So we have ran into…</p><h1 id="a-few-snags">a few snags!</h1><h2 id="do-you-kill-it">Do you kill it?</h2><p>“Uh yeah I already cast a fucking thunderwave at it that more do you want?”</p><p>Our new rule: If the intent is <em>obviously</em> murderous &amp; already sufficient, DM please just describe it.</p><p>We ran into a counter snag because if they aren’t killed, just hurt, I need to know “where you aimed”</p><p>I also had to be super clear that the killing prompt can be you doing a “re-hit”, or following through with your action, whatever makes sense in the diegesis (at our table we usually say diegesis rather than say spell ess-eye-ess or say “sis” like sister].</p><h2 id="are-we-being-cheated-out-of-actions">Are we being cheated out of actions?</h2><p>No but… if you <em>feel</em> that you’re being cheated out of actions you lose buy-in. Which is why I invented “transparency of method” in the first place back in the day.</p><p>Need to figure out a way to reassure players that everything is on the level. I had to go over to one of the players with “the fight book” where and show the action tally. Having it writ large on a wall or something might work. Then the player started saying “and then you could write an app and it could be digital and we could connect into it” and I kinda, uh, not into that. <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23luddite2097&amp;Mode=like">#luddite2097</a></p><p>But putting it up on the wall might be good. For a few sessions at least, so that there is some trust being built for this partic player to feel comf. Which is important♥</p><p>This player also is one of our three rules masters; but it’s all cloud←dice with them. Decisions start &amp; live among the dice but then the “cloud” is sort of a shadow realm reflecting the dice action. But with the new system the diegesis actually have some… uh… it leads into things! Fictional positioning mattered af!</p><h2 id="eww-is-this-like-mortal-kombat">Eww is this like Mortal Kombat?</h2><p>Yeah, kinda <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/></p><p>Honey I get it, it became kinda scary. One player really NOT into it at least at first. Violence has been veiled at our table up until now.</p><p>It’s way better than MC because it’s not bloody slash after bloody slash, the pretties are spending hp to negate attacks, but sure there was a bit of a “finish him” vibe at first.</p><h1 id="a-bunch-of-good-things">a bunch of good things!</h1><p>As I said in the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/483400/#Comment_483400" rel="nofollow">What did you play this week?</a>, the hit point spending worked really well! Nice to finally know unambiguously what hit points are.

I didn’t get my…</li><li>Ted: more of a “rolling all his [technically multiple] attacks together to describe all of the damage into one big diegetic strike” kind of guy!</li></ul><h1 id="stray-observations">Stray observations</h1><p>All five of them were awesome by the way!</p><p>Even the ones that had reservations did a really good describing things!!!</p><p>I really really pushed on the “you do <em>not</em> need variety, you do <em>not</em> need to be clever etc”.</p><p>This isn’t Exaulted/Wushu where you describe things first, it’s coolness judged, translated into bonus dice making your mechanical roll more effective.</p><p>This isn’t Feng Shui where you roll first, its mechanical impact judged, you given extreme liberties to turn that impact into narration.</p><p>This is kinda like AW/DW though. Has some similarities, some differences.</p><p>And like AW/DW what matters is what do you actually do in the SIS because I need to know that when describing how the monsters spend their HP.</p><p>There’s still a risk that it just falls away, even though that <em>definitely</em> didn’t happen today. The new words “they spend 14 hp to XYZ” might devolve to “they spend 14 hp to defend”. Anytime we almost fell into old habits, our inability to then describe the next action was an immediate wakeup call. “It… wait, how did you defend?” “Oh, yeah, I this-and-that!”</p> </div>

                            I don't know if this helps, not being a game designer myself, but perhaps you can do a walk through scenario for the purpose of explaining the whats and whys while soliciting questions from your players about where they are having problems or missing the mark.<br/><br/>Maybe there are problems within the system design and maybe the players just aren't grokking to the system or a combo of both.

That's right; that's why I lost my temper with them. At first I expressed strong gratitude for the feedback and then I started walking through it in detail, following along with their comments. And then the next day they were like "cool story but why can't we try it my way?" and I lost it because I had just thrown so many pearls before them<br/> </div>

                            So I'm kinda already tired of all the description. It's so boring and it's the same monster types all the time and everyone has their goto moves.<br/><br/>They LOVED having the board up so they could see HP and everything but the pen crapped out halfway through the session.                        </div>

The big difference was <b>the board up on the wall</b>.<br/><br/>We <b>ditched the murder prompts</b>. But my prediction that the system "needs" the other description (<b>IIEE, teeth etc</b>) still held up; the only skippable line is ironically the last one, the killing blow, and I just had to be disciplined to do those.<br/><br/>In one of the fights the hobos had trapped some gargoyles using a spell so that they <b>couldn't do anything</b>. And I was like "ok you can just kill them scratch some arrows" and then one player got confused and I said "OK we'll just roll it out yahtzee style"; when the monster's can't make moves there's no need for description.<br/><br/>But then later we had a more detailed fight again because, uh, not to keep on harping but the system really does force the description out (in order to select between the diegetically different but dice-level-equal monster moves). <b>It's just a not fun to describe the same types of hits and moves over and over again</b>. I use my shield ok you block its mouth with your shield etc.<br/><br/>An interesting side effect is that the increased focus on the diegetics lead to all of us <b>remembering to do all kinds of other moves</b> like shove, grapple etc. The room's features, balconies, ledges, bottomless slime pits etc all mattered way more as well.                        </div>

You need to say "I hit with shield", "I parry with morningstar", "I thrust with sword", "I slash with sword", "I try to klonk it with the shoulder of my armor" etc. These are all meaningfully different but once you've heard "I try to klonk it with the shoulder of my armor" nine times you get sick of it                        </div>

                            I'm still not seeing it, sorry. How is "I thrust with sword" different from "I slash with sword", under these rules? It seems to me that the only difference is that the responder will take your description into account.<br/><br/>If it really did matter, in a more important sense than that, I don't think people would be repeating descriptions.<br/><br/>So... I'm probably missing something in this system. <br/><br/>For example, "how exactly do you try to find the trap", in a Finchian trap-finding situation, really matters. You can say, "I do the same thing as last time," no problem, but you saying that still determines whether you find the trap or not (in other words, your description from "last time" is still meaningfully important - the actual action). When I say, "I spend 4 points to parry, ducking low", or "I'm ducking low - can I spend the 4 points now?", I don't think saying I'm ducking to the left, instead, matters at all, and, if it did, people wouldn't simply repeat their descriptions.                        </div>

I *think* we're actually exactly on the same page, then. The descriptions aren't (usually) changing the "dice" level of the game, but they're interactive in that they build on each other and create an exciting choreography of combat.<br/><br/>If you're starting to interface with that more, by "handing out adv/disadv like candy", then that changes this dramatically, of course! I didn't think you'd do that, it being somewhat against the RAW (depending on how you read the rules). That would definitely give the descriptions more teeth! You could even make it Blades-like by implementing your <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/22065/blades-position-effect-advantage-disadvantage-translator" rel="nofollow">"Blades position translator"</a>, which is what I'm imagining you starting to do here. That sounds like fun!

Thank you! I really appreciate. I'm working at this relatively "blind", compared to you.<br/><br/>I have to remind myself, in turn, that you're moving to this from a nearly "dice-only" form of D&amp;D combat, which is probably an <i>enormous</i> change in style, whereas *I'm* imagining starting from a highly detailed, descriptive combat (Critical Role is pretty close to how I've usually seen people play D&amp;D, in that sense), from which this change would (I think!) be very, very minor.                        </div>

It turned out really well today (third sesh). Couldn't really do any candy adv/disadv <small>(my name for referee adjudicated—albeit as impartially as possible—as opposed to wholly gloracular adv/disadv)</small> today because they were so good at using things like fire sensitivity, prone conditions, grappling etc to keep the Full Metal Francis Bride on lock down.<br/><br/>Also she (Francis that is) grappled a dork and tossed him into a death pit but he still had wildshapes left so he turned into a bat &amp; flew up. <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23CoDzilla&amp;Mode=like">#CoDzilla</a><br/><br/>The whole <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/483367/#Comment_483367" rel="nofollow">"going into codified moves"</a> thing is so great.

<i>Dar</i>ling that was in <i>pri</i>vate<br/><br/>but I'll provide some context for the entire class to enjoy.<br/><br/>In our fights before this new HP spending that <del>Paul invented</del> I am claiming 100% credit for, our flow had been very much "here are the dice rules; choose your action". This was something that it had gradually devolved into; new players are much more willing to just say a diegetical move and have us translate it into new and exciting positions.<br/><br/><i>For fights</i>. And, after a while, for another hyper-dice-alized situation, wilderness/hexcrawling procedures.<br/><br/>In other contexts we do it all Finchian &amp; Lawsian with only the very rare check.<br/><br/>BTW we really need to cook up a new name for 'dice'. Sorry <a href="/forums/profile/lumpley">@lumpley</a> but it's just confusing at this point.<img alt=":bawling:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/bawling.png" title=":bawling:"/><br/><br/>But our last three sessions even fighting (and ofc I'll try to find a way to convert other situations to work similarly) has been, uh… Lumplian? what's the fighting equiv of Finchian &amp; Lawsian… <img alt=":bawling:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/bawling.png" title=":bawling:"/><br/><br/>And I was thinking back on a passage in the D&amp;D rules that promote the "just tell me what you do! I'll tell you what dice you roll"–type of play. Which we now have achieved to a (scalarly) greater degree than just a few weeks ago. Not that the "here are the dice rules; choose your action"–style doesn't have some <i>significant</i> advantages, <b>for the subsystems where you are resolving questions through a dice-alized, multistep process</b>. (I Ching the original DMG.)<br/><br/>The "I'll tell you what dice you roll"–type of play does require a bit of ouija-boarding [not referring to ouija-boarding a premise-revelant story here, which, uh, that was a dumb &amp; patronizing theory the forge guys had because they didn't understand the emergent property of the gloracle &amp; blorb] in that in order to be effective you're rewarded if you have a dice-level understanding of your character. Especially wrt spells, or how strong you are (if you're weak then grappling isn't great).<br/><br/>Interestingly, since the change, martials have been more buffed than casters. And martial monsters have been more fun to play. Grappling PCs and throwing them down the death pit is the best                        </div>

And I was wondering if the games' designers actually did play this way themselves and was looking at some actual play recordings to try to "catch them" not doing it but everything I found they were actually doing it. So the hypothesis I was talking to Paul about making a post about ended up not being well-founded. See?

But when the diegesis is a relevant lexeme as per Laws, Finch, and now this system—they <i>have</i> to play with this flow. And we're having a lot of fun so far                        </div>

                            Yes, I understand where you're coming from now. I had always just *assumed* that your D&amp;D play was full of colourful descriptions and players doing clever stuff (because a lot of people play D&amp;D that way), but going from one extreme to the other is bound to change the way you play. I can well imagine that!<br/><br/>Here's a post (and the next one or two respond to it) which you might find interesting:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/469567/#Comment_469567" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/469567/#Comment_469567</a><br/><br/>Is that pretty close to what you're experiencing?                        </div>

                            Ah, yeah, if you occasionally let attacks succeed automatically, that changes the flow of combat quite a bit! (And the same thing goes if you assign advantage based on the description of the attack, as well - you've inserted another step into you combat flow resolution. My original "spend HP to defend" proposal had another step like that written in, where the defender could not decide how much to spend until the attacker described their attack. It was more "robust" in this sense; in your example the GM could easily forget that step, and no one would really notice.)                        </div>

Well, it's not just about "how much" [the various damage types and resistances lets there be a little bit of "how much" in version we're using too] and "whether", but "in what way". In essence the fight is diegetic and the hit points are a sort of "action point"–like resource to use in order to negate hits.

What's this, the twelfth time we're going over this?<br/>As DM if that step is skipped it's immediately noticable because then I (as the monster) wouldn't know how to defend (in this case grab&amp;snap the arrow) which I <i>need to do in order to not die</i>.                        </div>

                            Oh boy. Yeah, I still don't see that, at all. Let me rewrite your example:

Does anything go wrong? Seems like it would work just as smoothly, no problems here.<br/><br/>More to the point, it could be:
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/></p><p>Alice: I want to attack it with my bow (reaches for dice) what’s the AC?<br/><br/>DM: OK, the AC is 17.<br/><br/>Alice: <em>[rolls to hit, rolls damage]</em> 8 piercing.<br/><br/>DM: With her resistance to [piercing, probably?], she pays just 4, and then <em>[turns to Bob]</em> she tries to grab you Bob.</p>
</div></blockquote>
Obviously, play is more fun if you remember those bits, but I don't understand the claims that "play will fall apart" if you don't do it. That seems rather... overstated.<br/><br/>I think you've totally internalized this system now, and it's working great for you. That's lovely! But I don't think it's robust to the point that you could hand the rules to a bunch of strangers and reliably expect that they'll do the same thing. <br/><br/>It's not a deadly criticism - most games have lots of rules and interactions like this. It's just a minor point.                        </div>

                            Hi Sandra, I'm thinking of using these rules myself in an upcoming game and I was wondering about how you would do the diegesis of things such as a ghoul's paralysing attack. Because if HP is spent to effectively "avoid" the blow, how does the ghoul's nasty poison paralyse the hobos? I suppose you could say "the claws just barely scratch your arm as you duck out of the way, make a CON check..." but this seems like a bit of an annoying exception. Any ideas?                        </div>

                            Festering wound is also the mildest of all entries so I think it's a good idea to use them for this, adding it as the mildest thing that monsters could already inflict directly through the diegesis unless the players manage to defend themselves (death, DSFs, death save rolls, injury rolls, system shock rolls, and now adding in "specific lingering injuries" to the mix).<br/><br/>Or what's your take, <a href="/forums/profile/Andye">@Andye</a> ?                        </div>

                            It's also still possible to inflict HP loss, even though it's <i>primarily</i> a spendable resource pool [i guess diegetically almost exclusively fatigue &amp; moxie], just like how the Martial Arts Adept monster (Volo's p 216) can inflict <a href="https://open5e.com/gameplay-mechanics/conditions.html#stunned" rel="nofollow">stun, which is a way to inflict action econ loss</a>.<br/><br/>To avoid confusion I want to phrase most monster moves to primarily encourage HP spend than inflict HP loss.

                            To me, what you did is that : you turned a skeletal procedure into prompts. It changes everything. I think <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> recognizes the procedure, but wants to see how hard the prompts will hold. If players are going to cut corners. <br/>In theory, chain linking narration to dice makes every player the "controller" of the previous one, so it's either narrated combat devolves into dice rolling or it is enforced?<br/>Still, proof is always on you if you want to claim that it will work everytime.

                            As I said, claiming something works everytime after only trying it seven times would be pretty foolish.

It's hard to summarize it but I've gone over it thoroughly in the two threads.<br/><br/>Right now I think the part of the game that can benefit the most from further work is the dive insp. I want to make it more identifying stance while keeping the same semantics.<br/><br/>We have some players who would never voluntarily "fail" the way the rules are written now.                        </div>

                            On dive insp.<br/><br/>If I’m following you.<br/><br/>In IEE terms. You want the INTENT to be the same, but for the TIBF to trigger an EXECUTION change, that leads to a different EFFECT in the SiS.<br/><br/>So this generally takes the form of the TIBF exerting pressure on the EXECUTION that causes the EFFECT to be a failure.<br/><br/>Example:<br/><br/>I want to pick the lock (INTENT) but my lover is in danger (TIBF: Lover in danger), so my hands are shaking and sweaty (EXECUTION) which leads to failure (EFFECT)<br/><br/>So in your insp rules you say not to do this but I would add an extra way to trigger TIBF effects on the INTENT level. This might be to radical or messy though, consider it food for thought.<br/><br/>The framing is as follows.<br/><br/>Your character WANTS to succeed at adventure stuff but, they also have other things (trait things) they want to succeed at. When you ‘take a dive’ on adventure stuff to succeed at a trait thing INSTEAD, gain insp.<br/><br/>Examples: <br/><br/>GEEZER the old man has a TIBF ‘things were better in my day’. He goes to search the wall, which takes ten minutes. (That’s the adventure goal). The player decides to trigger the TIBF to get insp. He half heartedly searches the room while rambling on about his day. He fails to search properly but makes damn sure that everyone listening knows about how much better things were in his day.<br/><br/>Rogue with TIBF ‘member of oppressed class’. He goes to pick the lock. Decides to trigger his TIBF instead. Smashes the lock out of anger and screams about the injustice of it all. (His INTENT has changed to inform everyone of injustice at the cost of picking the lock).<br/><br/>So just to reiterate. We’re conceptualising a TIBF dive as a value conflict. The prime value is the one associated with the quest/goal. The ‘failure’ isn’t so much a failure as another value (TIBF) taking priority over the quest/goal, that causes disruption to the quest goal.<br/><br/>Anyway I hope that makes sense, when I did use TIBF type stuff in my games that’s how I did it. In fact I’d often make a character with a prime goal (restore the rightful king) then spike him by adding TIBF stuff that would fuck with that.                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> just speaking from the standpoint of D&amp;D player psychology here, they're going to be a lot more likely to voluntarily drop the flashlight if that means rolling with a penalty vs automatically failing. Of course, for some players even that won't be enough of an incentive so there's that too.<br/><br/>In my own games, I represent things like this as player-authored Minor Quests --- which ties the flashlight drop explicitly into the game's existing reward cycles: you drop the flashlight, you get XP (equal to a monster/trap/hazard of your level). My experience is that among D&amp;D players XP is a lot more enticing than getting a bonus on a roll.<br/><br/>Trent                        </div>

                            If someone put a gun to my head and told me I had to write and use TIBF rules. They’d be as follows.<br/><br/>The basic principle is ‘when one TIBF interferes with another TIBF, gain insp’. All actual mechanics would be ways of implementing that.<br/><br/>For this to work, everything a character does must in pursuit of a TIBF. This doesn’t need to be super strict, you just need a general understanding that your character is on a given quest because of a TIBF.<br/><br/>So in a general sense it would work like this.<br/><br/>My thief has ‘get stinking rich’ and ‘cowardly’.<br/><br/>I’m exploring a dungeon to get gold (stinking rich) but I hear a weird noise, could be danger, I fling my lantern on the floor and run screaming (cowardly)<br/><br/>When I’m about to roll the dice to do something. I’m doing it because it’s somehow helping me towards a TIBF end.<br/><br/>My paladin wants to restore the rightful king<br/>Smoke black root to be untroubled by the faces of those he’s murdered<br/><br/>I’m about to make a roll to fortify the palisade (which is to help me defeat the enemy army, to help me restore the rightful king)<br/><br/>The call for a roll acts as a cue to remind me to think about priorities. ‘other people can fortify the palisade, I’m going to go smoke black root’. (which counts as failing the roll and gets me insp).<br/><br/>What this system ‘might’ have issues with is the following:<br/><br/>I fail to pick the lock because my hands are shaking because ‘I’m a coward.’ <br/><br/>I’m halfway up the wall when I fall because ‘I have a deformed arm.’                        </div>

                            That wasn’t strong enough. <br/><br/>When you prioritize one important thing (TIBF) at the expense of another important thing (TIBF).<br/><br/>You do have to rethink how some things are framed for this though. Like the player might call ‘smoking smack’ a flaw. From the characters point of view they’re ‘getting rid of their pain’.<br/><br/>In TSOY you’d get XP just for doing it. In my system you need to ‘smoke smack’ at the expense of e.g. ‘being a good father figure’. So if you smoke smack instead of going to your daughters birthday, or you smoke smack, go to the Birthday and ruin it because you fall face down in the cake.                         </div>

<p><a href="/forums/profile/AlexanderWhite">@AlexanderWhite</a> those are still given the presumption that we’re going to go with the “two traits collide” thing; which I’m not sure about [as in honestly not sure; haven’t dismissed it yet].</p><p>Partly I think it might be too <i>hard</i>—I want traits to be able to collide not just with each other but with common decency, with the party, with other people’s traits. Partly I think it might be too <i>easy</i> to set up a pair of traits specifically designed to exploit this. <small>← cue standard “oh i wouldn’t play with cheaters anyway” spiel</small></p><p>For me, the specific design challenge I have right now is <b>making the mechanic character-facing rather than author-facing</b>.</p><p><a href="/forums/profile/Trent_W">@Trent_W</a> ’s suggestion made the mechanic milder but didn’t really change this issue.</p><p>Alexander’s suggestion made the mechanic apply to fewer cases; and the way he phrases his <b>diegetic examples</b> make them seem character facing, <i>buuut</i> the challenge of creating a character-facing “diegesis↔dice” <b>mapping</b> remains. (That doesn’t necessarily mean that they have to <i>start</i> on the diegetic level; as <a href="/forums/profile/lumpley">@lumpley</a> clarified playing fiction first doesn’t mean you have to play as if you were unaware of your own moves or your own stats. So for example the fighter’s “Second Wind” ability is a dice-level ability but can still be character facing; a character might decide she needs to focus her breath for a second.)</p><p>And if that challenge is solved, then Alexander’s or Trent’s suggestions might be unnecessary, or they might be the absolute gravy that makes the mechanic fly even higher.</p><p>Sorta like the first mapping issue I had in this thread; the “wound threshold”/“wounding time” thing that I thought would make the diegesis↔dice thing fly hasn’t really helped at all and I’ve been thinking about dropping it, while Paul’s idea of turning HP from lose to spend has been an absolute cornerstone.</p><p>Basically I think what needs to happen is that the traits need to become almost like abilities that you can use. Peeps been reporting good success with the keys in The Shadow of Yesterday, right? I obv don’t want the 1/2/5 granularity but I want to figure out why/how people have made them work. They’re even phrased “Your character loves wealth” instead of “you love wealth” and still they’ve worked for some peeps.</p><p>Here’s an example trait from the PHB “Flattery is my preferred trick for getting what I want.” [Yes, write-your-own traits are cooler, I get that, especially the bonds. But in my experience some people <em>love</em> rolling up random traits from the book. IDK why but they really do.]</p><p>While I (for a paper-based quick character generator I used for a con game) illegally typed in every single background from the PHB into TeX back in July 2015, (yes yes I know, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23manic2097&amp;Mode=like">#manic2097</a> ), I can’t easily rephrase them all and expect everyone I ever play with to have a character using these rather than from the book. Or idk, maybe.</p><p>So ideally I want a universal way to, uh, mechanize these using the move &amp; “diegetic ludeme” tech we’ve got going here. Like, some might look misleadingly easy: “I’m a born gambler who can’t resist taking a risk for a potential payoff.”</p><p>So the ultimate goal of this is so that DM don’t have to memorize all of the players’ stuff all the time! I want the characters to, through diegetical action/inaction in a way that is noticable to everyone at the table, can get insp, just like how the Second Wind fighter ability can give you HP or the Action Surge ability can give you action econ. I’m especially looking at <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/inspiration#taking-a-dive" rel="nofollow">the category of insp that I’ve called “taking a dive”</a>. Obviously no one wants to take a dive! That was a stupid way to write it up. Since I wrote the rules that way, no-one has ever went for that dive insp. (They’ve still been playing their character true to the traits though; they’re just not claiming insp for it. But then later being like “why don’t we have more insp”. Which, understandable, not blaming them, my rules are at fault here.) (Yes, the keys in The Shadow of Yesterday also have some of what I called “quest inspiration” in there.)</p><p>We had a lot of insp at our table because I knew the characters well (not necessarily studying their traits list but being able to think “ok, no normal munchkinhobo would’ve ever done that, that has to be a character thing”) and so I’d go “It seems like there just was a spontaneous Hillfolk scene, or there just was someone giving in to their trait, here have some insp” and trying to move to a more player-initiated take on insp hasn’t worked out yet [granted, it’s only been <strong>three</strong> sessions, all of which <em>also</em> had this remarkable new fighting system and an elaborate &amp; blorby heist being pulled off].</p><p><small>(The reason for my Λυσιστράτη-like withholding of insp is again to not have to learn all their stuff and also because I had gotten somewhat sloppy like “oh you reminded me of a rule that I have forgotten but the rule is gonna kill you but you said it anyway? here have some insp”. Which, OK, either I change the rules to include that kinda stuff or I don’t do that kinda stuff.)</small></p><p>So part of what made the HP spending thing have such dramatic results right away was, just as Paul predicted:</p><p>you initiate a hard af move (inflicting death or serious pain) diegetically, and the only way to be able to negate it is to either make the defense roll or spend the HP. It’s a mechanic you <em>have</em> to engage with <em>or else you die</em>. My insp rules as currently written are the opposite of that. If you <em>do</em> engage with them, it sucks. You drop a rope or whatever.</p><p>I need to find the perfect, uh, “teeth” for these mechanics.</p><p>OK, kinda typing-as-I-think here, but… extending the Hillfolk dramatic tokens to procedural.</p><p>The semantics I want is that “If someone gives into you” you give them insp, from the bank if you have none. Wait, that’s backwards. I don’t want “someone” doing things, I want <em>you</em> doing things. “If you win an argument” you have to pay them insp (from the bank if you have none). OK, better, but it’s not always arguments it can also be things like validation, acknowledgement, trust etc. Also the “if/when” trigger stuff is great for things that the DM can be arsed to care about but not as good for things that are player initiatated. [Yes, a lot of PbtA moves are phrased that way but I don’t think they work that well.]</p><p>Guh working on the socks darned fighting rules took two weeks and now I’ve immediately jumped into another challenge why do I do this to myself <img alt=":bawling:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/bawling.png" title=":bawling:"/></p> </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">@Deliverator</a> tying them into leveling up is great. Tying it into something the character needs… resting is another possibility… I'm not 100% <i>committed</i> to doing that but I'm def thinking of that. Among all the "potentially great gravies" this is the one I believe in, more strongly than the "it's alright ma it's only disad" or the "these two sides of my brain needs to have a meeting" takes [although ofc those deserve playtesting too].

                            I guess I should calm down for a second and remind myself that it's fine if they don't have insp. Ideas such that diminishing (or removing altogether) the benefits of long rest for people who haven't spent insp that day is fun but I've said in the past that I appreciate the way the insp stuff is optional for a player to engage with. Maybe that's a philosophy I should stick to, IDK. (Honestly not sure what I want; mandatory insp frenzy or suuuper laxed don't worry about never having insp.)<br/><br/>Again, that's in relation to the <a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">@Deliverator</a> style gravy which certainly is an especially toothy gravy [uh this metaphor turned gross] but regardless of which; I have this mental block rn preventing me from solving the mapping issue.                        </div>

                            Sure! But if you’re interested more specifically on the flow of the conversation (“remapping”, as you said), that’s not enough.

                            Well, my partic skillset is turning "how I want the players to talk to each other" into mech inputs/outputs and IIEE. I haven't gotten to that first point yet though.<br/><br/>So let's start at question one: how <b>do</b> I want the participants to talk to each other?<br/><br/>Again, I'm pretty satisfied with the "hillfolky" insp. I've gotten the players on board to playtest the "challenged to inaction" variant (not until Saturday though).

The one and only and singular and admittedly minor reason I want there to be a rule (such as "you get insp") for Max throwing his lantern is to protect Alex from the other players' consternation. To be like "You might not like this move but it is not only allowed by, it's actively rewarded by the rules". The reward is crappy and minor and useless and <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21720/affordance-markers-vs-usable-rewards/p1" rel="nofollow">pure affordance</a> but it's there.                        </div>

                            Ah, that's a pretty good insight: you don't actually want this to drive play, you just want it as "affordance/protection". In that case, is it even important to have Personal Characteristics (or whatever the hell they are called)?<br/><br/>Could you have the following rule, for instance?
<blockquote>When you make a choice that seems cowardly, questionable, or unwise, the GM will ask you:<br/><br/>"Are you doing that because it feels true/authentic to the character, despite the risks to the party?"<br/><br/>If the player says "yes", everyone in the party immediately gains Inspiration.<br/></blockquote>
It seems to me that, if this is the purpose of the rules, the *other* players getting something out of a situation where Alex effectively screwed them over might be even more important than Alex getting something. (I thought about making the rule "everyone except Alex gets Inspiration", too, but I don't know if you gain anything interesting by withholding a bennie from Alex.)<br/> </div>

                            I just stumbled across a new video of Matt Mercer running a brief adventure for Stephen Colbert. Very cute! Covered it here:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/484181/#Comment_484181" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/484181/#Comment_484181</a><br/><br/>However, it's relevant to this thread because I was watching it, and now I can't watch anyone play D&amp;D without thinking about the conversational flow of combat.<br/><br/>We can see how, with Mercer's attention to narrative detail, D&amp;D combat is always fictionally vivid and constantly evolving. I think this is what you were talking about earlier, Sandra, that I wasn't getting: when you go from "Yahtzee combat" to colourful description, suddenly more variety in combat takes place, because individual descriptions inspire new "moves" and ideas of things to try. (Mercer arguably overdoes this in the adventure, when he describes the panther's attack as knocking Colbert's character prone, but fortunately that never becomes important mechanically.) I didn't catch that at all earlier, because I didn't realize Sandra was coming from "Yahtzee combat", and therefore didn't understand why it would make a difference. I think that, on the surface, the descriptions here are probably quite similar to what you're doing now, right, Sandra (in terms fictional detail and flow)?<br/><br/>However, I was also thinking the whole time about <i>how much better</i> and easier that would be if we had players rolling all the dice (the defense roll, as in PbtA games, based on a player's announced action in response) and if the "HP spending" metaphor was also being employed. That would make maintaining the discipline of this kind of narration much more natural (and easier not to forget).<br/><br/>This reminds me of two somewhat unrelated thoughts:<br/><br/>1. If I were to do this, I would want to rename hit points, probably. I'd want a term that says "last minute ass saving points" somehow, and then feats and abilities and tags could give us stuff to say with those. (A wizard with a magical aura of protection could narrate bursts of light turning away blows, for instance. You could think of that as adding "moves" to the PC's sheet; when you spend HP, you pick one of them.)<br/><br/>What term might work to replace HP? I can't think of any good word/phrase off the top of my head. <br/><br/>2. Also, for my tastes, I'd want to make more of a distinction between "successful defense roll" and "HP spend". I know that the flexibility of description is a nice feature, but it would also make it more "blorby" if there was a narrative constraint on the two (sometimes description matters, after all), as well as inspiring different/new narration.<br/><br/>This would also help on the GM's side, because it's unfortunate if when I'm hitting all my rolls against the Ogre the combat doesn't <i>feel</i> any different than if I was missing all of them.<br/><br/>(In other words, I'd use "successful defense" for "snatched the arrow out of the air", but the Desperation Point/HP spend would be a graze or a close call. One is a confident defense; the other is a desperately close call, barely avoided.                        </div>

That's exactly what I wanted. I <b>don't</b> want "hohoho you couldn't even hit a barn you swung that sword three miles left of the ogre".<br/>

You fired an arrow against a 59 hit point ogre…?! It can just swat that arrow away like nothing! That's why you aim!<br/><br/>I'm 1000% fine with HP sometimes, or often, being more like <b>AWESOME</b> points than "desperation" points. Buuut the diegesis &amp; the very nature of the "second line of defense" makes it work out in a cool way anyway. You'd rather make your defense rolls than have to spend HP, so in those cases yes it feels desperate. Almost automatically. Which is part of why this system works so well.                        </div>

                            Like, take the offense equiv to hit points, which is "action surge". Sometimes you action surge out of desperation ("I'm dying but maaaaybe I can get in <i>just</i> enough if I do my last effort") and sometimes you do it out of sheer awesomeness.                        </div>

                            With some Actual Play examples we had one character parrying &amp; reparrying with a quarter staff &amp; sometimes ducking &amp; crouching, and two other characters who both are morningstar-and-shield builds alternating parrying with the weapon &amp; blocking with the shield. It just worx great, the fact that the two lines of defense can use either "moveset" (or, as I would've put it: either "vocab") <i>really</i> helped cut down on the learning curve. Remember, at the onset of this project I was terrified of the amount of new vocab we would have to build.                        </div>

Yes, that has crossed my mind as well. Would make it more analogous to Hillfolk &amp; thus easier to remember.<br/><br/>But otoh, I like that you get <i>actively rewarded</i> for fucking up the mission. The game I ran for <a href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">@JonatanK</a>, he asked "Well if we're gonna play D&amp;D I have some trepidation… some groups really are so focused on 'you have to succeed with the mission', it can kinda..." and I said "If you fuck up the mission, you get rewarded."<br/>His jaw dropped and he had to repeat it to double checked if he heard correctly. "You get rewarded?"<br/><br/>Now, <i>that's</i> a strong affordance marker. Again, the reward is puny and def <i>not</i> commensurate. But it is a "hey Taschenlampenfallerlasser? You did <i>good</i> today. <i>Thank you</i> for dropping the flashlight."                        </div>

It’s just… I want to keep playtesting these rules because I’m super optimistic re them, before I make that kind of extremely radical &amp; disruptive change to them. I take ABT seriously and the current iteration still deserves more testing. Maybe I’ll eat crow in a few months when I’ve changed to something more akin to what you and Paul are suggesting now, but that’s then. We only play twice a week so I don’t have infinity time testing. Also, fighting works now, further improvement is diminishing returns compared to the insp rules which are currently broken &amp; need attention!</p> </div>

Oh, you mean on the monster side.<br/><br/>That was also to sorta tell Paul that if you just say "I shoot" at a monster with 59 hp, they can easily defend vs that!

Whoa! Interesting. (Really not a fan of this kind of D&amp;D-ism... getting knocked prone should be an effect of some kind of game maneuver or "physics" principle, not a "special ability" reserved for certain species... but I suppose it could have inspired Mercer here! There was no Strength save, but he could have been thinking about that ability at some level, true.)<br/><br/>I went back and reviewed the clip, and it's actually more involved/complex than that!<br/><br/>The panther knocks the PC prone as <i>part of the narration of the PC's failed attack</i> (!!!), and then, as part of the panther's failed attack, the situation is narrated as being somewhat back to status quo (although it sounds like the PC is still likely prone, the next action settles the fight, so we don't really get to find out whether the prone-ness was just colour or mechanically significant).<br/><br/> </div>

                            Haven't gotten to see the TV programme yet but note that all characters can knock prone (it costs one attack &amp; you need to succeed on a strength check) it's just more cheap for the panthers in terms of action econ; the good part about this kind of design is that fights become more varied because various monster types will tend to favor various kinds of attacks. If I were to make the game I'd make monsters just be one number (HD) but I can def appreciate the pros along with the cons of the D&amp;D-isms.                        </div>

<p><strong>Content warning: very graphic violence</strong> courtesy of gore-meister Mercer♥</p><p>Also <strong>spoilers</strong> for Colbert’s red nose day game!</p><p>As promised, have now watched the TV Programme™ with Dungeon Master Matt Mercer and Stephen “Stephen Colbert” Colbert.</p><p>(About the panther thing, well, it’s clear that DM doesn’t follow the RAW exactly I guess. It’s some sort of custom monster (a skull panther) but a monster that knocks you prone when you miss against it is completely new. Cool idea though.)</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>However, I was also thinking the whole time about <i>how much better</i> and easier that would be if we had players rolling all the dice (the defense roll, as in PbtA games, based on a player’s announced action in response) and if the “HP spending” metaphor was also being employed. That would make maintaining the discipline of this kind of narration much more natural (and easier not to forget).</p></div></blockquote><p>Yes; and that’s why this hadn’t been working for me before.<br/>You see that Dungeon Master describes things very diegetically and then as soon as there’s damage he uses dice terms <em>as if they were</em> diegetical even when that makes zero sense. You take 4 points of piercing damage in the face, well, what does that mean? Four separate tiny vampire neck wounds on the lip? Or what?</p><p>Here are all the instances of damage being delt on this show.</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/TV show or w/e" rel="nofollow">TV show or w/e</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>—Let’s Thunderwave this bad boy.<br/>—Okay, all right! It goes and runs towards you to leap once more as you pull up your hands and cast Thunderwave. This giant wave of force energy blasts out in front of you. So you deal—it says there 2d8 thunder damage.<br/>—2d8 thunder damage.<br/>—Does not make its saving throw.<br/>—10. Six and four.<br/>—10 points of thunder damage. You watch as it leaps in the air, its jaws open, its claws extended towards you—as it blasts outward. You actually shake the flesh off of its bones. It scatters into a large spray of dark ichor and bone. And this little skull of this panther, scrape to the ground and roll at the base of your foot, and roll at the base of your foot, destroyed. —I haven’t heard the word “ichor” in almost 30 years. —Welcome back.</p></div></blockquote><p>As discussed earlier, describing damage is easy <em>if</em> it happens to be lethal.</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/TV show or w/e" rel="nofollow">TV show or w/e</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>—Okay. You get about 40 feet because you’ve used some of your 10 feet of your 50 foot length to tie yourself to the post.<br/>—I’ll accept your judgment.<br/>—You stop at that point. Right as this large burst of arcane energy blasts out of the side of the imp in your direction. You take— Three points of arcane damage as it hits you in the right shoulder, almost throwing you off the bridge. Also, I would like you to roll a percentile dice for me right there if you don’t mind.<br/>—Uh, which one is which?<br/>—So that’s 55.—55, okay, great.<br/>Okay, so the blast of arcane energy off your shoulder emits this burst of fire that nearly—but does not—catch the rope bridge.</p></div></blockquote><p>A large burst of arcane energy hit you in the shoulder? What happens? What does that mean? Enough to almost burn the bridge?? Are you OK, Capo?</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/TV show or w/e" rel="nofollow">TV show or w/e</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>In your research of the Crimson Sphere of Generosity, these must be discarded attempts that failed at recreating its magic that are now small mites rushing towards you. Seven of these are gonna leap at you as you try and rush past. The first one, that’s gonna be—<br/>—(whispers) Seven.<br/>—That’s gonna be a 14, I believe that hits.<br/>—Okay, but they can’t do a lot of damage.<br/>—That one does one point of damage. You kick it off the side of your boot. The second one, that would be an 11. This one was not even an issue, it just misses you, whiffing past. Another set, a pair of them, go leaping towards your face. Three, and okay—one of them you manage to bat out of the way, the other one does latch onto the side of your face, and with that one you take another one point of damage.<br/>—Okay.<br/>—The last three are now rolling towards you, coming from the front of the tomb. With a nine, which misses your armor class, a four, which misses your armor class, and a 15, which hits. So you manage to just dodge out of the way of two of them, and the final one leaps right towards you and latches onto your chin for four points of piercing damage.<br/>—Man! 15, if I’ve got that math right, I’m down to 15 here.<br/>—You rip it off the chin, throw it, it shatters against the crystal floor, but however, you stop at the base of the tomb, look around you, and all the rest of them have come to rest, apparently no longer aware of your presence.</p></div></blockquote><p>Here we see a Cary-like “DM does most of the talking, the player only saying the occasional number”.</p><p>Also one damage, in Mercer’s system, you can just kick off the boot while four is some kind of vague wound</p><p>He doesn’t have the stamina / PBP division that Sil’s game has. (Or that I have as well; with DSFs and wounds and LIs being “real damage”.)</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/TV show or w/e" rel="nofollow">TV show or w/e</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>—All right, Zathkira, seeing this, goes, “Ah, I should’ve known!” And pulls back, and you watch the hands crackle with divine and arcane energy on both sides, slams them together as a bolt of lightning fires from his hands in your direction. You have resistance, you take half damage.

                            Great analysis!

To me it was clear that Colbert's character wasn't actually knocked prone-as-D&amp;D-term-of-art. The "you're dragged to the ground, it pounces on top of you, you throw it to the side" seemed to be colour, not affecting the battle at all.                        </div>

I think the video shows the obvious and most common way to resolve this in D&amp;D: any lingering narration resolves itself to no effect at first opportunity, resolution is unencumbered by effects from narration only.<br/><br/>Colbert swings wide and is knocked down as the pather jumps on top of him.<br/><br/>Since that's just colour narration, not the D&amp;D prone condition, the panther makes it's attack normally (rather than with advantage as against a target with the D&amp;D prone condition), and a miss gives Colbert the chance to throw it off and get up (no check, no action, on the panther's turn).<br/><br/>Colbert made a normal attack and missed. The panther made a normal attack and missed. Everything else is colour.<br/><br/>A giant dragon tries to bite the hero and misses, its jaws held open by the hero's spear.<br/><br/>On the hero's turn, he jabs the spear harder into the dragon's jaw, the dragon recoils in pain and shakes him off, the hero rolls and picks himself up and throws his spear at another enemy.<br/><br/>The dragon made a normal attack and missed. The hero made a normal attack. Everything else is colour.<br/><br/>The obvious disadvantage here is that it's easy for players to start to see everything other than trading attack rolls to become mere colour, unnecessary, irrelevant, and stop doing it.                        </div>

                            Oh, another thing:<br/><br/>Talk to me about "A. fight variety, monsters become samey"!<br/><br/>I can see that removing a variety of mechanical effects might make fights less varied. (I'd hope the diegetic details would change that, by adding a different sort of richness - instead of "in this fight, I got touched by wights because the dice said so", it's "what do we know about the wights, and do we want to risk letting them touch us, despite having few hit points left?" - but I think you could easily be right about that, as well.)<br/><br/>However, one thing I like about my proposal is how it uses HP the way they're meant to be used: to pace the fight and stave off deadly outcomes.<br/><br/>In D&amp;D as-written, you, a powerful warrior with tons of HP, get in a fight with the wights or ghouls or whoever. Your weakling (that is, fewer HP) friend is fighting by your side.<br/><br/>It's entirely possible that the very first blow means you get hit and level drained or wounded or infected or whatever. That's good for variety! But also kind of goes against the whole idea of HP as pacing mechanism.<br/><br/>We might have, for instance, the powerful fighter get level drained on the first blow, but still (otherwise) be in great fighting shape. Meanwhile, his companion could get hit multiple times and lose the fight or even die, but never get level drained (because all the saves were successful).<br/><br/>Under my proposed system, fights would tend to go "we fight for a while, maneuvering, but no one can land a real blow / I get low on HP so I can no longer avoid your attacks outright, so I get touched and level drained/infected/whatever as I'm on the verge of losing the fight / then I die". <br/><br/>(There would still be some variety, like if the warrior decided to be stingy with the hit points and let himself take a blow right away, but it would be based on player decisions instead of random dice rolls.)<br/><br/>I originally brought this forward because it seems to match the aesthetics of combat you wanted so well: it's all bloodless at first, then eventually there's the potential to suffer a magic effect or poison (as a sort of warning call, maybe), and eventually a lethal blow.<br/><br/>Curious to hear your thoughts! What kind of variety are you afraid of losing?<br/><br/>(I do take your point on the hassle of rewriting the rules, of course; it's not a concern for me, since I'm not actually planning to do it at that level, but I can see that being a very real one.)                        </div>

Yeah, I think superhero fiction gets around that but having lots of "punch-like" effects (throwing people through walls), which don't "break the skin", and vaguely-defined superpowers like an ice blast, which we don't have any real reference for. It's much harder to imagine a knife slash which connects with a human target but doesn't do any lasting harm; we have a pretty good sense of how dangerous that is!<br/><br/> </div>

<p><strong>Content warning: graphic crocodile biting</strong></p><p>Yes, just as how there are enemies that fly or enemies that can hide as a mere bonus action rather than a full action there are now enemies where it’s harder to use the second line of defense (<a href="https://open5e.com/monsters/monsters_a-z/g/ghouls/ghoul" rel="nofollow">ghouls</a>, <a href="https://open5e.com/monsters/monsters_a-z/w/wraith" rel="nofollow">wraiths</a>) or enemies where it’s impossible to use the second line of defense (<a href="https://open5e.com/monsters/miscellaneous-creatures/crocodile.html" rel="nofollow">crocodiles</a>).</p><p>Our goal was to get crystal clear fiction.</p><p>Would’ve been easy if I could accept the “slasher film” model that Capo can have a gaping 14-points big lighting wound in his chest but I would rather have a <em>more</em> swashbuckly model.

<b>I think a key technique to use is to get good at realizing when you need to collapse multiple dice-level engagements to the same prompt</b>, or when you can/should separate them with diegetical engagement in between.  "Spend 21 hp and make a DC 14 con save to do that." "Spend 7 hp, your upcoming main action, and make a DC 12 dex check to do that." Examples of collapsing two or three dice level things into one prompt.<br/><br/>As always, you're going from diegetics to dice and from dice to diegetics in search of clarity/saliency; only switching layers because you want to know something from that layer.                        </div>

                            Very interesting to see this take shape. “Collapsing” several procedures into a single prompt is an excellent idea. (It’s the kind of thing that makes me, ultimately, want to redesign from scratch, but as a way of keeping the existing rules of D&amp;D with a more “modern” flow at the table, it’s a smart compromise.)                        </div>

Similarly I’m OK with how ghouls and crocs just <em>are</em> more dangerous and more likely to inflict wounds. It’s a power that they have just like how Cave Rats in DW deal “messy” damage.<br/><br/> </div>
