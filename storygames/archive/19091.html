And the sheer volume of numbers to be allocated and crunched eventually drove me away. I had a bit of an epiphany, really. We'd had a saga running for a couple of years, with some problems but also some good stuff. And this NPC magus was shaping up to be the villain of the piece, so I thought I'd better stat him up in case the players decided to get mechanical with him, and what with wizard PCs not being easily constrained by plot due to their eldritch powers. Then I found my self putting off statting him up, winging his stats during his appearances for more than half a year. And then finally the true horror of why I'd been putting it off dawned on me:<br/><br/>Statting him up properly would require me to first distribute some five hundred points in scores of different boxes across some half a dozen different categories, stopping along the way to check in some cases if his total values in three different stats summed up to allow him access to stuff in a fourth category. This would leave me with a 25-years old magus. AND THEN the system would, in dead earnest, like me to age him from 25 to his actual age of 70 by distributing an extra 30 points per year, year by year, all the way up to seventy, <i>and also making an aging roll, taking into account the strength of his longevity ritual, for every year from 35 to 70.</i><br/><br/>At this moment, I realized that if I had a choice between statting op Dietrich Eulenauge and digging my own eye out with a fork, I'd probably stat him up. But I'd think about it. We wound up the saga with a grand climax within a month or two, and I stubbornly ad-libbed him all the way to the end. When someone mentioned the possibility of starting another saga, my laugh was more than slightly hysterical. I left Ars Magica and I'm never ever coming back.<br/><br/>Ahem. Having played my way from 2nd to 5th, and based on your stated preferences, I heartily recommend 2nd edition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426260/#Comment_426260" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-25T15:48:10+00:00" title="December 25, 2013  3:48PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see e23 and paizo sell a bunch of 2nd edition supplements, but not the core book.

Sure, you can get by with the combination by ignoring the rules a lot in the way trad games encourage, but you <i>could</i> also just port the game to a less bothersome rules set that'll actually leave you some time to enjoy the medieval cast of thousands, saint feasts, ancient magical lore, faeries and whatever else. Heroquest is an excellent choice for this purpose, very commendable - fits the Ars much better than it fits Glorantha, even <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>(I have a bit of an Opinion on the matter right now, having observed a bunch of friends messing about with Ars - 4th edition I think - for the last few months. It is emphatically not a game you want to get into as written unless the group is very committed and skilled with roleplaying games. It requires an unique combination of historical knowledge, artistic commitment to setting-immersion, and accounting skills to actually enjoy the math. Any group can attempt to play it, but I never see anybody achieving a coherent creative agenda unless they drift the heck out of the game.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426479/#Comment_426479" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-02T12:05:02+00:00" title="January  2, 2014 12:05PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I really want to try Ben Robbins Kingdom in the Ars Magica setting.

The hideousness of large crunchy formulae that would intrude into every act of play was just too much, though.  Even improving a character, a normally enjoyable thing in most games, became a tedious chore requiring a few hours of crunching.  And spontaneous magic, a very cool idea, was hampered by rules that undermined its effectiveness.  I'll never play the system again, although I do appreciate it for the many cool and innovative ideas it brought forth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
