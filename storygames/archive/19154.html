To my detriment, I've only recently begun soaking up all the game design theory of the past two decades, and I'm trying to break in to the community. I'd love some feedback on a piece of design I'm working on.<br/><br/>I'm trying to structure some player-facing mechanics to describe character motivation. Please take a look at this character sheet mock-up as a visual aid: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/fru7pr89kvh8ku1/Charactersheet.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.dropbox.com/s/fru7pr89kvh8ku1/Charactersheet.pdf</a><br/><br/>The left side of the sheet describes the character's nature. What they're likely to do, what they value, who they love; why and how they act. A character has a set pool of "natural dice" that they use to do things which are in their nature to do. <br/><br/>They can also invest those natural dice in relationships, goals, or whatever to get more dice for those specific things. For example, if I invest a natural die in the relationship, "Wants to impress Laura," I get two dice for doing anything I think will impress Laura, but I lose the die that I invested for all other purposes.<br/><br/>On the right side of the sheet are various actions / moves / things to do. Each action has a rating from 1 to 6, which describes how good the character is at doing that thing. <br/><br/>If something in a character's nature would prompt her to do one of the actions, her player rolls those dice and compares the numbers to the rating of the action. Each die that comes up at or below the action's rating is a win. The number of wins is significant in some way TBD. Feel free to ignore the actual descriptions of the actions, as they require a lot more attention. Feedback also welcome, though (If you could actually just figure them all out for me that would be great.)<br/><br/>The idea is that any time a player is rolling dice, her character is investing some part of herself in the action. The player is forced in a very basic rules way to think about what a character <i>would</i> do, as well as what they <i>can</i> do. The player must choose how many of her dice to invest in an action, just as her character is choosing how much of <i>herself</i> to invest.<br/><br/>My strongest basic feelings about using dice in roleplaying games are that:<br/>-Every roll should be preceded by a meaningful decision and followed by a meaningful narrative development (the story should move forward with every roll.)<br/>-Any game-level tactics/decisions used by the player should run parallel to the story-level tactics experienced by the character<br/>-The end-user experience of using the dice should be fast, intuitive, and intrinsically satisfying<br/>-The fiction should affect the outcome of dice rolls<br/><br/>I'd be grateful for any suggestions that would help me do the above things. Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427409/#Comment_427409" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-18T21:48:28+00:00" title="January 18, 2014  9:48PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Crone Nature and Dark Nature sound great, and the action list is distinctive and intriguing!<br/><br/>I'm not sure I follow your description of the system, though.  Would it be possible for you to post a link to a filled-out character sheet?  A Crone who's all ready to start rolling dice in play?<br/><br/>If I understand your post, then I might roll my 3 <b>relies on her brains</b> dice, summing the total and hoping to exceed my target number of 4 (meaning I'm okay at it) for the <b>judge character</b> action.  Right?  <br/><br/>I think I see how you want this to go: My Crone is engaged in conversation with a traveling medicine man, who tries to enlist her in a noble and lucrative quest, so I call on my knowledge of her nature to see how she'll respond.  Spotting "relies on her brains" (or having already internalized and remembered it), I decide to not go along too hastily, and try to judge the medicine man's character.  Correct?<br/><br/>Here's how I think it will actually go, based on experience with many character trait systems: When the medicine man gives his speech, I desperately want to know if he's legit or a charlatan, so I resolve to use the judge character move so I can find out.  This choice is based slightly on my concept of my Crone as a specific individual, but moreso on my concept that she's not a total idiot and thus I'm free to investigate as I choose.  I will then look down my Nature list and see whatever fits the situation and will get me the most dice.<br/><br/>Maybe that's good enough!<br/><br/>Personally, though, I'm tired of it, so I'd go much farther.  I'd remove all useful and generic-sounding traits from Nature, leaving only a collection of extremes and flaws.  After that, I'd be an absolute cut-throat about "no shoehorning in Natures that don't really apply".  In effect, the character may <i>only</i> take Actions when acting on the facets of their Nature that are <i>not</i> "what any reasonable player/character would do".  When those Natures don't apply, well then that's the part of the story we don't care about, so no rolls are made.<br/><br/>I know that's pretty extreme, but maybe you can compare it to your current draft and see where on the spectrum you feel is best.<br/><br/>Another idea: "her character is choosing how much of <i>herself</i> to invest" -- for this to have teeth, dice invested this way should either go away, or have a chance to go away.  If I'm still just as good at relying on my brains after the roll as I was before it, regardless of how the roll goes, then that's not much of an investment, in my eyes.  It's simply "I do the thing I'm good at".  On the other hand, if a failed roll shakes my Crone's faith in her ability to rely on her brains, or otherwise undermines/erodes/changes her self-concept, then the investment in the effort feels meaningful to me.  The mechanic for this could either be positive feedback (victory spirals and death spirals), negative feedback (low scores easily rise, high scores easily fall), or random.  Depends on whether you want the typical character path to be one of narrowing or branching out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dirk" title="Dirk"><img alt="Dirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dirk">Dirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427412/#Comment_427412" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-18T22:34:59+00:00" title="January 18, 2014 10:34PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome\n<blockquote><br/>If I understand your post, then I might roll my 3 <b>relies on her brains</b> dice, summing the total and hoping to exceed my target number of 4 (meaning I'm okay at it) for the <b>judge character</b> action.

Mostly I'm just afraid of the backlash from players who resent the loss of freedom (as a player i'm also somewhat afraid to let go of that freedom.)<br/><br/>I think it does need to move further toward the extreme end of the spectrum to be anything interesting, though.

The game has an explicit sequential structure (scenes) and giving characters a finite amount of dice to roll per scene appeals to me as a solution, although it doesn't address how someone is affected by their success or failure. I've also been trying to avoid binary success / failure outcomes on these actions, which sends ripples of complication everywhere.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427413/#Comment_427413" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-18T22:57:03+00:00" title="January 18, 2014 10:57PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 18, 2014 11:03PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do you want to tie the character nature stuff into the system of situation-&gt;action-&gt;ripples of compilation?  Or do you want to keep character nature more off to the side as roleplaying constraint/incentive?<br/><br/>If you want it to be central, you might ask, "What's interesting about people's natures?" and then your resolution could address that.<br/><br/>My answers would include:<br/>- what they're compelled to do<br/>- what they can't do<br/>- what they assume about new people/places/things/events<br/>- how they conceptualize and describe all of the above<br/>- changes to their nature<br/> -- what would make them change? (both type and degree)<br/> -- will their identity become more entrenched, or less?<br/> -- will they undergo a complete reversal on anything?\n<blockquote>I think it does need to move further toward the extreme end of the spectrum to be anything interesting, though.

Just as you discover how capable your Marvel super-guy can be within the limits of his powers, in my game you discover how capable your twisted protagonist can be within the limits of their habits and prejudices."  Or, y'know, whatever actually suits your vision.<br/><br/>I bet that would prevent plenty of folks from playing, but then the ones who did play would not be frustrated.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
