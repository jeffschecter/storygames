However, if you've had a lot of experience with one way to play, it can be hard to adjust or learn a new way.  You may even seem hostile to it, even though you may eventually really enjoy it.<br/><br/>The first time I played Burning Wheel I had a Belief about getting revenge on a priest who I had trouble with when I was going to join the clergy.  My first scene in the game involved him walking into a pub and berating me publicly.  And I just sat there and took it.  Not because I thought that's what my character would do, but because I didn't know what else to do.<br/><br/>Now, I eventually figured out what was what and things got on better and I'm now in the post-raving-mad BW fanboy stage.  But if I had kept being like that eventually one of us at the table should have realized that the game wasn't for me.  But how do you know the difference between learning curve and bad fit, especially if it's someone who's been playing a very different way for years or decades?  I'm curious what others' experience with this issue is.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391300/#Comment_391300" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-25T08:28:27+00:00" title="September 25, 2012  8:28AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The difference between learning curve and bad fit is philosophical only. It goes into what we consider humanity and individual people to be like, and into what is practical in a given situation.<br/><br/>There are people for whom not liking a specific sort of game is an identity issue. Perhaps what that game is about is contrary to how they believe themselves or the world to be. However, is this a bad fit, or is it just that the person is unwilling to learn? What is the difference, again? Nothing more than our willingness to provide labels.<br/><br/>Learning is adapting, so a bad fit is merely unwillingness to learn. This even goes for games that are not a good fit for anybody, people are amazingly adaptable given the right conditions (the right motivations to learn). This is what has been called "brain damage" by Ron Edwards when he discussed it, which choice of words apparently was not too well received.<br/><br/>In practice all this means that you'll go to greater lengths about learning and teaching a game when a person you care about offers that game, or when it's the only game in town, for example. In practice you'll also need less work to learn a game that already accords with your held beliefs and skills. Games that you don't want to learn are, of course, more difficult, as you're fighting the process. Then afterwards we call equations where effort matched the difficulty "easy to learn" or "difficult to learn" all according to how much effort was needed; equations where effort was not enough and the attempt at integrating the game failed we call "a bad fit between the game and the player". It's not inexact, although the impression that this is somehow different than difficulty in learning is. A game that nobody gets we call a "bad game".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391301/#Comment_391301" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-25T08:33:33+00:00" title="September 25, 2012  8:33AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 25, 2012 8:34AM by w176.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you don't.

I don't like the blamey way it's been framed here, as if it's a player's stubborn unwillingness to be flexible or to put effort in that accounts for every "bad fit". There's an opportunity cost to sticking with a game I don't get until such time as I get it; the cost is all the time that could have been spent playing a game I enjoy and that's more intuitive for me. There may not be enough years in my life to spend "getting" a game. And even if I eventually get it (which I may not, if <a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">@Deliverator</a> is right, but let's say I do), doesn't mean I'll like it. And even if I like it, doesn't mean I like it so much it'll make the slog worthwhile in the end. So I have to make an assessment "ex ante facto" (before I undertake the effort) about the level of commitment I would have to make, and the things I would have to give up to pursue that commitment. Given that assessment, I may have perfectly respectable, legitimate reasons to deem a game a "bad fit" for me, personally.<br/><br/>Can we say something like this, instead? The difference between a learning curve and a bad fit lies in the player's personal assessment of cost and likelihood of success. When we're promoting a game, we obviously want our friends to put in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">some</span> effort. But when we're playing a game someone else hands us, we obviously want <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> to have to put in a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">burdensome</span> effort. And how much is "enough" or "too much" depends partly on personal preference, and partly on negotiable expectations we have of other people we game with. If you give the game a try and it's just not fun, I think it's fair to submit to your group that the game is a bad fit. They can decide for themselves whether you tried in good faith, whether you really gave it the ol' college try. Groups should prefer players who make that good faith effort, and players should prefer groups that don't have unreasonable expectations in this regard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391401/#Comment_391401" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-26T05:24:44+00:00" title="September 26, 2012  5:24AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This doesn't even touch on the times when you play a game you think you really like with a GROUP who is a bad fit.<br/><br/>I agree that the perjorative phrasing in Eero's theory is where he loses me.

Bad fit.<br/><br/>I also think learning curves can be faster or slower depending on the player's abilities, experience, and enthusiasm.

I'd also played a demo a few months before. The sessions were fun, and out group had a good time overall, but I knew by the end of the run that I had no interest in pursuing the game any more. I didn't like the system at all.<br/><br/>That was a good faith effort.<br/><br/>When I ran <i>Marvel heroic</i> the first time, the guys playing with me had not read the rules (not their fault, of course), and I was very shaky as Watcher. They objected to many of the concepts of the game even before we started, picked the game apart as we played, goofed around, and then declared the game "broken" after our first session. None of them will ever play that game again, and they literally wince when I mention that I'm running a campaign of it now.<br/><br/>That was not a good faith effort.<br/><br/>Now, it's possible that the latter case was just a bad fit, but I can't really know given the players' behavior. The former case was hands-down an issue of bad fit (one of the Marvel players was in that group, too); despite some doubts about the mechanics, we went into the game with honest intentions and drew a conclusion after we'd become familiar.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391407/#Comment_391407" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-26T08:06:28+00:00" title="September 26, 2012  8:06AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 26, 2012 8:08AM by Rickard.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I believe it's just a matter of how you AND the game portray it all. My opinion is that the game shouldn't just tell you (the reader) the rules and how to play the game, it should also tell you how to present the game to your players. If you get a comment like "I see the point in the game, but I don't like it", then it's just a bad fit. If you get comments like "I don't like it" or "Can't we play Call of Cthulhu instead", then it's probably just a learning curve.<br/><br/>And it's my belief that there is no such thing as learning curve when it comes to game styles. It's just a bad explained game. When I started introducing people to fish tank or a heavy narrating kind of games, it usually took me 2-3 session before the players got it. That's a learning curve. As the years passed on, I picked up structures on how to present my games and people understood the game style after a half an hour. Sure, there is still a learning curve but mostly when it comes to the rule mechanics. All games has that kind of learning curve. On to how to play the game? After an in-game example or two, they usually get it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul" title="Irminsul"><img alt="Irminsul" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul">Irminsul</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391408/#Comment_391408" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-26T08:19:56+00:00" title="September 26, 2012  8:19AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 26, 2012 7:22PM by Irminsul.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And some people just don't like the taste of liver and onions.

The B* game economies provide powerful incentives but not in a way I was accustomed, so I had this tension between how an RPG is supposed to work (!) and how this RPG worked. My learning curve was setting aside my expectations; I don't know if that would have been possible without (IMO) a high level of psychic flexibility, made safe for me by trusting that the designer knew what he was doing. Getting to know the designer helped a lot (the social footprint component is a whole 'nother piece of this puzzle) and since we share a taste for uh...enthusiastic (but earnest!) debate, I could open my head and find the fun in the game. <br/><br/>Other players in my group did not or could not for whatever reason. Expectations, discomfort with the procedures (big one: Burning anything games are strongly player-driven), the economies didn't click (they wanted points for <i>winning</i>, not <i>generating</i>, conflicts). Those guys dropped, social footprint be damned, and they haven't come back.<br/><br/>Apocalypse World: Again totally gaga about the subject matter, intellectually attracted to the conceit of the engine (the rules are here to prompt a conversation), high level of abstract respect for the creator -- although Dogs never quite clicked for me either, people I respect respect Vincent's work. But the game has never clicked in a powerful, visceral way for me. It's easy-breezy to run (good) but around session 3 or 4 the whole thing starts to lose steam. That 3-4 sessions is my good-faith effort with any group, once I've decided I have more than a passing interest in a game. <br/><br/>I think for me, AW's social interaction model and rituals are where I don't quite click with it. The game takes away some GMing tools I'd rather have, and gives me tools I don't know how to use. And it turns out that my experience facilitating games is sometimes <i>but not always</i> in a conversational mode. No big and I'll happily play it and run it, but it's an imperfect fit. I feel compelled to include the usual caveats and apologia here: "imperfect" is not synonymous with "bad" so, AW fiends, be cool.<br/><br/>(For a truly bad-fit story, I'd also go with Serenity.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391416/#Comment_391416" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-26T08:52:07+00:00" title="September 26, 2012  8:52AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I did not intend, nor do I see, anything disparaging about my analysis of the concept.

I warn you, this is going to be boring, and it's ultimately just going to be a semantic argument about what I meant when I used some words when I wrote something at a message board. Nothing useful or important at all, per se. The very best that you or I will get out of the rest of this post is finding out that yes, Eero really does have an opinion I disagree with, or no, Eero apparently just explained himself in a way that I didn't understand. Why anybody should care this or that way I don't get.<br/><br/>"Learning is adapting, so a bad fit is merely unwillingness to learn."<br/><br/>I can see how one could infer the above to mean that I somehow dismiss external factors and reduce all possible cases of badly suited games to a person's stubborn inflexibility. However, this would be a ridiculous position. What I instead meant - and apparently I wrote in haste, for it evidently didn't come through - was that learning is a self-directed psychological process that requires certain preconditions to occur, and that what is called a "bad fit" between a game and a player is always technically some type of deficit in learning.<br/><br/>Now, before another round of indignation, I want to emphasize that when I say "deficit in learning" it is not a value judgment; I am using the term in a wide sense, as a synonym for "growing into" or "internalizing" an identity feature. Learning is not always a volitional act! I chose to use the word in this way specifically to emphasize how the initial question about the learning curve provides an illusionary dichotomy. Once you notice that learning is just another form of adapting to the environment, you realize that it is not always desirable or possible. People have deeply held beliefs, habits and needs that are usually not possible to be unlearnt. This is what I mean when I say "unwillingness to learn" or "deficit in learning": if you were capable of discarding everything that makes you yourself, then I believe that you would find any game to be an equally good fit for you.<br/><br/>I do think that being open-minded and capable of learning many things and how to enjoy them, games included, is a positive feature in a human being. However, there also needs to be an Aristotelian mean here: a person's identity, the beautiful parts included, consists of features we're not willing (or able, if you insist on this distinction) to unlearn and replace at the drop of a hat. How would you like a person who'd learn to enjoy murder just like that? In some cases these limitations to our ability to adapt/learn/change are very deeply-rooted and <i>practically</i> insurmountable, making for a case of bad fit between the player and the game. It is still an unwillingness to learn, I think, but it is such a fundamental one that for practical purposes we just have to accept that the person is that way for good. However, I think it's important to understand that "learning curve vs. bad fit" is a continuum, not two special psychological cases, even if some cases of bad fit are so fundamental that you're <i>never</i> going to teach that person to be a different way from how they are.\n<blockquote>I don't buy "a bad fit is merely <i>unwillingness </i>to learn". Surely it could also be <i>inability</i> to learn, or even to <i>enjoy</i>.</blockquote>\nSure, definitely so. I reduced the case a bit in the interest of brevity upthread, and to emphasize the idea that an unwillingness is an inability from a certain sort of behaviorist viewpoint. Ultimately my point was that it's somewhat academic as to whether we say that somebody is unwilling to learn because they are unable to let go of prior convictions, for example; when we're talking about the psychological makeup of a person it doesn't much make sense to talk about free will at the same time, as the psychological makeup is the explaining vehicle for why the will is directed in the way it is.<br/><br/>Lastly, I want to illustrate the psychology of the bad fit by telling about a game that I am not fit for. I am by nature a serious sort of person who is more inspired and directed by ideals than emotions. I despise immersive roleplaying games that have no higher purpose than experiencing exotic feelings; for me a roleplaying game has to be about structure and interaction and the literary arts to be worthwhile, and I get distinctly uncomfortable when I am expected to merely "let go" and reduce the rational machine I am into a conduit for subconscious drives. As might be imagined, I am a rather bad fit for games like say Ars Amandi, or really the vast majority of immersionist, experientalist Nordic designs. I'll go for it if the social stakes are high enough, but I'd never choose to play this type of game of my own volition. (Well, if we assumed a hypothetical scenario where it was the only game in town, I guess I might adapt to accept it over time. Who knows.)<br/><br/>You'll notice that I'm introspective enough to realize that the fact that I don't enjoy the above type of game is not a reason for condemning it - if I were to attempt to condemn immersionist play culture, I would need to bring something more to the table aside from my personal dislike. This is what I meant when I said that it's childish to seek for somebody at fault when a person doesn't want to learn a game that is a bad fit for him. We wouldn't be individuals at all if we didn't have firmly-rooted preferences, it is sometimes definitely justified for a person to just not like something! It is very much a case by case matter as to whether it would be <i>good</i> for somebody to expand their horizons or whatever, but that goes so deep into the philosophy of human nature and interaction that I don't expect anybody to want to go there on a discussion forum like this. I think the best conclusion we can make is that adults are self-directed beings and that should be respected; they'll tell you if they want to or don't want to go to the effort of learning something, and that's pretty much the final word barring some very exceptional circumstances.<br/><br/>I understand that this thread was practically started on the premise that we should take sides and decide who's at fault when one guy wants to teach a game and another doesn't want to be taught, but I just don't think that that's an useful way to go about resolving the conflict. I would rather seek to recognize the reasons for why this person does not answer to and adapt to a game that many others have found enjoyable; once you understand the whys, you can decide whether it is worth it in this case to insist on it. Sometimes I push a bit myself, but often enough it's because I'm the adult at a table of teenager players, and I think on the spot that it'll do good for the other person to get some variety of experience.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392121/#Comment_392121" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-02T13:22:45+00:00" title="October  2, 2012  1:22PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 2, 2012 1:24PM by creases.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, thank you for your thoughtful reply! I still want to push on your suggestion a bit, though.<br/><br/>I'm sure you don't intend to be belittling to a player who deems some game a "bad fit" for them. However, I wonder to what extent you might have tacitly adopted the perspective (and values) of a DM or game designer wanting a player to give their game a shot and being rebuffed. The reason I wonder this is because if you cast yourself as the player who tries a game and finds it to be a bad fit, I think it would be a very peculiar way to describe and explain your own situation to say, for example, "I have a fundamental unwillingness to learn, and for practical purposes you just have to accept that I am that way for good." I would certainly prickle if I were in that position and someone attributed that view to me, not least because I would think it was an unfair characterization. This suggests to me that your account is not value-neutral, but rather reflects an implicit frustration or disappointment with players of the sort you're describing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392128/#Comment_392128" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-02T13:56:13+00:00" title="October  2, 2012  1:56PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think we're just facing a cultural divide here. I admit that I'm a pretty cold fish (rationalist fish, whatever) even by local standards, and Finns in general are considered abrasive in comparison to many other national cultures for exactly this sort of thing. The sort of objective language you posit is exactly the sort of thing I might use about myself were I trying to communicate external observation about myself. (Self-centered exceptionalism is not a cultural value hereabouts, note, so I don't have as much need to have different frames of subjective vs. objective thought as somebody from a more individualist culture might have.) I don't mean to belittle anybody by such a choice of perspective, I'm just trying to be brave and unflinching in looking at reality the way it is. If I find a neuropsychological model of learning useful as a tool of understanding human psychology in general, then it's the least I can do to view my own humanity by that lense as well.<br/><br/>I don't really think that I have much of a bias on this thing to either direction. I'm definitely over any young man's need to have everybody like the same things I do! The world's full of amazingly beautiful hobbies and arts that I don't have a passion for myself. If I looked down upon people who don't get or need my games, then I would have to logically despise myself for not being more passionate about rug-weaving. I mean, I do totally appreciate that rug-viewing is interesting stuff, and the results are beautiful, but I probably won't have the time to delve into it in this life-time. This psychological limitation of mine is just part of who I am as a finite being, I can't have the scope of mind to appreciate everything in the world for its full value.<br/><br/>That being said, I'm of course interested in alternative ways of phrasing the psychology of the bad fit. How does a person view this sort of "bad fit" situation internally? My own take would be that where an external observer sees an unique person who has arbitrarily grown into the type of human who doesn't like something, the same person probably perceives this nature of his as a set of values, virtues, beliefs, interests and priorities in life. I mean, my internal reason for not doing more rug-weaving than I do (which would be just enough to learn how to use the loom) is basically a combination of not being as emotionally impacted by this art as I am by e.g. literature; not believing that rug-weaving is very important; not having time for rug-weaving as I have other passions in life. That cluster of personality traits I have regarding rug-weaving is fundamentally just the outcome of a process of learning; internally I see it as values, while from an external viewpoint it's a firmly embedded learnt nature that I refuse to relinquish, what with having an ego and all instead of just being a blob of malleable protoplasm.<br/><br/>But anyway, be that as it may, the main point here is that I don't think that I'm fundamentally disagreeing with anybody on the nature of game-learning or any other substantial issue, so this is just a terminology debate. My substantial contribution on the topic was basically that the suggested pedagogical dichotomy is false, and it is more exact to view the possible difficulties in game-learning as a continuum ranging from easily overcome (where a person's nature receives a new game easily) to almost impossible (where learning the game would require the person to become a fundamentally different person from who he currently is).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392141/#Comment_392141" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-02T15:09:44+00:00" title="October  2, 2012  3:09PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 2, 2012 3:12PM by creases.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my view, the perspective you've chosen from which to frame what you have to say has no greater claim to objectivity, to rationality, or to recognition as a description of "reality the way it is" than that in which I framed my point in the second paragraph of my first post in this thread; and mine no more reflects "self-centered exceptionalism" than yours. So, this is not just a misunderstanding, nor a quirky cultural difference, nor just a question of arbitrary terminology (since it hangs on the issue of whether terminology might be morally problematic if one person chooses terms to describe the actions of others that those others find belittling), but also a substantive disagreement about bias and the role of values in putatively objective descriptions. I think that's the end of my part in this discussion, so you should just take my view for whatever you think it's worth.
