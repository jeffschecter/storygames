We played the Quickstart scenario (once again), this time a little more clear with on the procedures/rules.<br/><br/>I gave the introductions, said I was confortable GM the Thieves Crew(as I've not read the Cult and am clearer on what thieves need/want). I said that that the crew mattered, then the characters - and since they were just two players that the link between them were important. I said they could be brothers, childhood friends, refugees from the same place or lover, or whatever.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The characters were:</span> <br/><br/>Groth 22, a CUTTER from a hunting family. Orphaned, got into the city when he was 19.<br/>Girolamo Berini 23, a SLIDE noble, from a family of ill fortune (lost two ships, father in dept-prison)<br/><br/>They decided they were cellmates from the Ironhook Prison. They got arrested for beating up a noble from the Caminin noble family. After two years they were released in a "lottery", since the prison became full after som protests. After establishing setting, it came clear that someone had helped them ... in game we suspect it the be the Lampblacks. 6 months later they run a small-time racketeering graft, but now things have changed [SEE BitD Quickstart].<br/><br/>The Water Rats have a secure lair in the an abandoned "Water &amp; Sewer department"-tower and a few kids [shadows].<br/><br/>Groth's friend is Grace, an extortionist, a Burgher Lady whom he feels "friendzoned" from. She's clearly not your regular extortionist. His vice is gambling; dice games, while  Girolamo's vice is lovers and he has a regular one who's a 1. secretary in the Crow's foot council. <br/><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Opening play</span><br/><br/>1st scene is at Basco Bacz, the Leader of the Lampblacks. I describe him and let him ask: "Sooo, why are you here?" (Then I make the colloqiel T and ask "WHY are you here?") Girolamo, the SLIDE, has Basco Baz as one of his contacts, and they're +1 with the Lampblacks and -1 with the Red Sashes, so he says: "We're here to suggest a score, a hit on the drug routes of the Sashes".<br/><br/>They do, but Basco Bacz isn't impressed and says it's all "well good", but he makes a speech about "either you're with us or against us" and the Water Rats convince him that they are (they're actually genuin), and Groth promises to step up if there's violence ahead. Then Basco mentions that he might have something just for them. A woman will visit Mylara Klev and bring some letters. He wants the letters and suggest they steal them from her desk. They negotiate a little, and it's clear that this is mainly a test of their loyalty, but that he really wants those letters and there's also something else there. <br/><br/>[NOTE: This is not a suggested score from the Quickstart, but I like to jam, reincorporate and help highlight the characters spesifically. It's really easy to jam i BitD.]<br/><br/>The players discuss, and both want to do a Deception run - posing as Water inspectors. They agree that infiltration or assault (the carriage as it comes crosses the bridge into Crow's foot.) They meet with their respective contacts. Groth drinks coffe with this high-class woman in a caf\xe9 at the market, and she'll ask around and then she makes him eat. It's clear that she's of a much higher class, also in the extortionist trade, but there's something that she likes about the arrangement. She promises to get back to him, and kisses him on his cheek in the doorway.<br/><br/>Girolamo meets Lanette, the Clerk, at her office, she stands on a library-chair getting a file when he walks in and everyone stops, and she turns around and blushes. "Is she married?" I ask. "No, she's not, but she used to," the player says and we agree that she's risen to become 1st secretary after the divorce?/death? from/of her husband. He wants to get information about the Lady Natala, and we cut back to the same morning when Groth learns her full name. Lady Natala Caminin. We have an impromptu flashback were they discuss her name and realize she must be the sister of the one who's the reason why they went to jail. She's involved with the House Caminin Trading Company, which has had good fortune the last decades.<br/><br/>Then we have two scenes before they enter trough the front gates of the Red Sashes fencing school/temple. First Groth posing as a Water and Drainage-worker and going on an inspection route with an WAD-inspector, his clipboard and three other goons. <br/><br/>"You have a leak."<br/>"Surely not?"<br/>*clank* <br/>"Yes you do, here's our bill."<br/><br/>Groth manages to get the three goons to moonlight with them while Girolamo meets with his mistress Lanette. "How are you fucking her?" I ask. He's not, he says. He's being attentive, bringing flowers and they're making love. A Devil's Bargain means his now committed to dining out in public. Oh, and by the way: Girolamo's Vice is Lovers. <br/><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Mission</span><br/><br/>Get into the Office - an 8-segment clock<br/>Get the papers - a four-segment clock<br/>get out - dependent upon what happens, probably 8 or higher<br/><br/>They talk to the burly swordsman at the gates. The danger is that in effect he'll deny entry. They succeed, so luckily the remedy danger isn't used. Two tics marked, still a long way to go. Then they get to the main house and see leader from the temple part of the organisation who's enthused to see them! "There you are, this was quick! Excellent." They also spot young acolytes carrying scrolls up from the Basement. The danger is that Groth will be stuck in the basement. He is, and Girolamo ends up stuck talking and smoking with the priest, who's confindent that the water leakage is beeing handled. (It is, thanks to the guys from the Water and Drainage-department.)<br/><br/>Four hours later they insist on getting payment - and then getting the document signed by the one in command. Lucky dice rolls and perhaps a lenient GM, though they rolled from a Desperate position. They enter the office and Myrlava, draped only in fine, almost see-through silk sheets puts her signature on it, they learn something about the relationship between her and Lady Natala Caminin. It would seem this was a bone Basco had planned on tossing the Water Rats. They manage to get the papers in one go, and I realize that I don't have anything for them getting out, so they just do. <br/><br/>They have three and four stress, and both indulge their vices. Girolamo reduces heat and drops coin to the Water and Drainage-departement, which we put on the sheet as a tier II-faction. Groth, on the other hand, works on his long-time project of getting Grace to consider him carnally. Girolamo takes stress to help, and insists that he spend coin. 2 segments of 8 filled.<br/><br/><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thoughts</span> <br/><br/>The Point/Back-up worked brilliantly in getting team play. The not-exactly-social character Groth talked a lot in this adventure, even if it was set-up actions. <br/><br/>Making Dangers for a deception gig was difficult, and since a lot of the Devil's Bargains were not accepted I'm thinking now that they should be dangers. Two of the time-related dangers just ended up meaning something for the characters (and not the players). I'll look forward to a Google+ tutorial for making dangers (and what seperates them from the Devil's Bargains). Right now I can think of some cool, but not attractive dangers for the players and characters be scared to face.<br/><br/>Choosing plan, then playing is really important. The order of the factors are not meaningless. <br/><br/>I'm excited for playing in a campaing. I want to be both a player and a GM in this game!<br/><br/>I think smooth runs can escalate quickly with worse rolling. This is a good feature!<br/><br/>The long-term project clocks are brilliant! They really make campaigns shine. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
