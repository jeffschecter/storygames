It went well and I can't wait to play some more!<br/><br/>I ran it as a one-shot for a monthly local roleplaying gathering, with three players, <b>Annie</b>, <b>Matthew</b> and <b>Mark</b>. Annie's my wife and new to roleplaying, though we've played several games together in the last few months. Mark I've played with once before (a Capes game I facilitated), and Matthew I've met but not played with. Annie and Matthew had been prepping with me before the day of, and had characters ready, while Mark was a late addition who gamely hurled himself into the proceedings.<br/><br/>I set the game in the midst of the <a href="http://tsoy.crngames.com/Ammeni%2C_Flower_of_Hell" rel="nofollow">Ammenite</a>  incursion into <a href="http://tsoy.crngames.com/Khale%2C_Roots_of_the_World" rel="nofollow">Khale</a>, and all the juicy conflict inherent there. <b>Annie</b> played <b>Eugenia</b>, an elderly Ammenite noble who's been championing (to deaf ears, naturally) freedom and human rights for years, is fed up and traveling to Khale to try to make contact with their central government (they must have one, right? Right?) and bolster them into a free state that can stand up to the Ammenites. <b>Matthew</b> played <b>Gavin</b>, a Maldorian Scholar/Soldier/Medic who's safeguarding the Book of Lore his Master died for, and following its secrets into Khale, using Ammenite military service as a pretext. And <b>Mark</b> played <b>Karsh</b>, an iconoclast Goblin from the far reaches of Qek, uncannily wise, traveling the world out of belief in his own great Destiny. His Addiction was selfless acts.<br/><br/><b>Of Dragons and Distrust</b><br/><br/>We opened on a contingent of Ammenite troops slogging through the Zaru swamps on their way to reinforce a fledgling outpost in Khale. Gavin was attached to them with a temporary Lieutenant's commission (the Sergeant afforded him only gruff mock-deference), on assignment to serve as the outpost Magistrate's retainer. Eugenia was traveling with them for safety, telling no one of her plans to \u201cgo native\u201d upon arrival. Karsh was wandering on his own, soon to meet up with the company by the whims of Fate.<br/><br/>You're probably thinking this seems hopelessly open-ended for a one-shot\u2014and you're right. I tried to move things along as quickly as was reasonable, but still only ended up with two set-pieces and a modicum of NPC interactions, the larger threads of plot only starting to manifest. A good time was had, though, and everyone seemed to have fun with the setting, system, and character interactions.<br/><br/>Everyone was full of creativity, both at manipulating the system and just plain playing their characters (which, thankfully, are complementary goals in TsoY). All three PCs had custom-designed Keys; Gavin's was the Key of the Steward for his priceless Book, Eugenia had the Key of the Idealist\u20141, 2, and 5 tied respectively to Property, Liberty, and Life!\u2014and Mark tweaked the Key of Faith into the Key of Destiny, gaining XP for defending his fatedness to others. Not to mention Mark altered the Secret of Evaluate into the Secret of Insight, using his Counseling Ability to discern characters' Keys and important relationships. Too bad he failed every Insight Roll. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Karsh joined the group by finding and bringing a wounded scout back to camp. There was much ado over what had torn up the lad's leg; he was raving about a hideous monster, but the Sergeant was inclined to dismiss him as overexcitable. Gavin's divination revealed that there was in fact a great beast about, and Karsh's Sense Danger caught ominous movement in the swamp water, while Eugenia teased some knowledge of the dreaded Mud Dragon from a reluctant Zaru, then unsuccessfully tried to make the Sergeant see reason. I had fun teasing the situation; the Sergeant was almost convinced when a guard was sucked under, but turned away when it turned out he'd just slipped. Of course, that's when the Mud Dragon (crocodile, of course) DID attack!<br/><br/>It was a good learning experience, system-wise, though it came with a narrative hiccup. Originally, following the wounded scout, Gavin's vision of scales and saw-teeth, and Eugenia's slave interview, I had a soldier sucked under\u2014indeed by the Mud Dragon. But Mark was like, \u201cwhoa, whoa, with my Sense Danger I'd be able to tell if something was up.\u201d And I replied, \u201ccertainly; you've got to announce that you're doing it and make an ability check, though.\u201d And so we backed up and did that. Check successful, so Karsh spots movement, and later the roving eyes above the surface; he's ready for the beast and with Gavin's help takes it down, providing a Mud Dragon supper. Mark was Johnny-on-the-spot with Ability Checks for the rest of the night, so I'd say the message of TsoY's player proactivity got through. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Meanwhile, not wanting to render his victory meaningless, I opted not to kill off the Guard, instead using his disappearance as a false alarm.<br/><br/>[cont]                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108188/#Comment_108188" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-13T21:37:11+00:00" title="November 13, 2007  9:37PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Spears at Midnight!</b><br/><br/>The group arrived two days later at the budding Ammeni settlement and were greeted by the Magistrate, a minor Noble of a house rival to Eugenia's who was delighted to have someone of quality to converse with (this extended to Gavin too, when it came out he was a scholar). There were some scared and beleaguered civilian colonists and a mess o' Zaru laborers doing most of the work, none of which I got to present in any detail, as I would if we were playing in a more extended fashion. Instead following dinner with the Magistrate (in which they met his masochistic pet Goblin Gliplip), everyone retired to bed only to be awakened by a Khalean lightning raid!<br/><br/>They hurled flaming spears into the settlement perimeter and set the Magistrate's dwelling on fire. (Mark questioned why forest defenders would use fire, to which I replied that they were using the dirt floor of the settlement clearing as a buffer. I also had it in my head that they're getting a little desperate, with the arrival of fresh troops and all, so their attack is more foolhardy. Another thing we could have explored given more time.) Karsh seized on this opportunity to set about rescuing Gliplip, while Eugenia saw her chance to escape into the forest to make Khalean contact. Gavin thought of nothing but saving as much of the Magistrate's library as possible from the fire. At this point a web of frantic alliances sprung into being\u2014Eugenia told Gavin her intentions and enlisted his aid, setting up a rendezvous following escaping the village. Karsh helped Eugenia escape the burning building and asked her to take and protect Gliplip. Then, Karsh helped Gavin escape the building too, but was separated from him when they confronted a couple of Khalean raiders; Karsh dodged and slipped away into the night, while Gavin disarmed his foe but was then tackled and captured. They saw he was not Ammenite, so spared his life, and when the defending soldiers regrouped and began to rout the smaller raiding party, the retreating warriors dragged poor Gavin off with them.<br/><br/>And that was where we closed for the night. Fun stuff, but really only beginning to scratch the surface of Character and Situation. Everyone hit about all their Keys, I think, and earned an Advance each, but no chance to spend it. There's an off chance we may be able to follow-up with another session, but I wouldn't bet on it. So the experience remains as a tantalizing taste and valuable tutorial. We're all glad we played, at the very least.<br/><br/><b>Some general impressions:</b><br/><br/>The rules are smooth and intuitive, and the mechanic for chaining abilities together particularly spurred a lot of creative and fun play. I had a ton of fun stakes-framing, which gave consequences for failed rolls that would otherwise have just been \u201cyou fail, try again.\u201d When Gavin and Karsh were trying to bash their way out of the flaming library, I told 'em failure meant that the most rare and useful scroll that Gavin found would catch fire. They failed, and Matthew wanted to Bring Down the Pain on the wall, until we realized you can't BDtP on an inanimate object (I was kinda nice, anyway: the scroll did catch fire, but didn't burn up completely. I wanted to complicate Gavin's life, not create dead ends).<br/><br/>It would have been nice to have a Pain-bringing, though. . .that's the one rules area we didn't cover. I think Mark was a little disappointed because his Secret of Synergy only affects BdtP, a point he was confused on. I wanted him to see just how badassed SoS is in a Pain-Bringing situation, plus a more extended conflict would've been fun. Oh well.<br/><br/>After the game, Annie remarked that it was her favorite system that she's played so far (she's played 1001 Nights, Dogs, and Shock:). She found it intuitive and very naturally flowing, despite having a hard time following my rules-explanations. We talked about that and Annie said she found the initial setting-discussion great, but the rules-discussion dreary. I have a tendency to want to explain everything the players will need to know up-front, rather than taking an explain-as-you-go, learn-by-doing approach. I could have just said \u201croleplay freeform until you want to use an Ability, then we'll walk through that process,\u201d and saved myself a lot of trouble. Which is what ended up happening anyway; my pre-explaining was for naught. So I learned a lot about how to approach game-teaching and facilitating, which is neat. (You'd think the Capes quickstart demo would have taught me that already, but I'm afraid it took someone far sexier\u2014believe it or not\u2014than Tony Lower-Basch to get the message through.)<br/><br/>So in short, Shadow of Yesterday=cool. The mechanics are a breeze but with enough robust options to engage the player, the format is comfortably Fantasy-Adventurey while driving smoothly toward cool story conflicts, and GMing is a snap and fun to boot. Yay, Clinton, and thanks!<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108240/#Comment_108240" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-14T09:02:47+00:00" title="November 14, 2007  9:02AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It sounds like great fun.

The setting I'm still not enthralled by, but we played in the part which most interests me (Ammeni/Khale), and I could grow to like it more given the opportunity.  I don't know if it's the artwork or what but part of my reaction to the setting has always come from that it was supposedly inspired by Leiber and Howard, both of whom I adore, but I just don't see it.  I <i>should </i> love Near, but I just don't for whatever reason and can't figure why.  I actively disliked the goblins of Near, but with the way Mark played Karsh, I found myself enjoying even that.  Having a PC race where the character actively <i>needs</i> something badly right from the get go is a great hook/frame, and a great design decision.  You didn't mention one of my favorite moments of the session - Karsh's masterful, mocking crafting of a marionette of Magistrate Daltan.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll three of our characters were really built for the long game, and only began to touch on the Keys which drive them.  I would enjoy playing again, given the opportunity.  As much as I liked our beginning characters, I'd like to see some moderately experienced characters with 3-4 Keys; those are great guides and references for playing your character.  It's funny - when I play a d20, I don't give a damn about experience points (in part because earning them usually involves combat which is <i>sometimes</i> a chore in most of forms that system assumes), and also I dislike getting them because leveling is another chore.  But Keys are fun and have me actively looking for ways to play the character I made the way I want.  And there's no chore at the end of that, as Advances are really easy to affect.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would have liked to see the Bringing the Pain mechanic in play, and I think we might have wanted a penalty die assigned here or there (I know you were taking it easy on us for starters), though Gavin did end up getting captured...<br/>\n<br/>\nThough I've take a lot of inspirations from it over the last couple years with various FATE hacks and drifting other games using some of TSOY's mechanics, this was my first time getting to actually play it - thanks for the opportunity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108461/#Comment_108461" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-15T18:07:21+00:00" title="November 15, 2007  6:07PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh,I almost forgot--you folks playing at home can find Matthew and Annie's character writeups <a href="http://www.goplaypdx.com/forum/index.php?topic=42.msg220#msg220" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

But I do see it in the setting, from the "sprawling ruins of strange kingdoms old when the world was young" kinda feel, to the gritty, "fuck the Gods, its we humans who decide the course of events, by our sheer mettle!" attitude. But our play group pushed tone in a slightly different direction, I think,and no wonder. I'm not sure how much of a Lieber/Howard man Markis, but I know Annie hasn't read them. Though I daresay the vibe wasn't <i>wholly</i> absent, for all that. I think it might come out more with a greater focus on enacting one's will at point of sword.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nemomeme</cite> I actively disliked the goblins of Near, but with the way Mark played Karsh, I found myself enjoying even that.

For instance the Mud Dragon was trying to stalk the caravan, but thanks to Divination and Sense Danger you guys were ready for him. And you fought the Khalean raider on more or less equal tewrms--and DID lose. Besides, I could have sworn I assigned a Penalty Die <i>some</i>where. . .anyway, I think that's something you would see emerge in longer play, as the stakes get higher and higher in the adventure.<br><br>Thanks again for playing!<br><br>Peace,<br>-Joel                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108462/#Comment_108462" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-15T18:07:37+00:00" title="November 15, 2007  6:07PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, all you TSoY pros, here's a couple of rules questions that came up in our game:<br><br/>1) Are we reading right that Heal checks remove harm of equal rank to your Success level, and that the Harm heals all at once or not at all? Like, when Gavin tried to heal the scout's Crocodile-mangled leg, I ruled that it was Harm 4-Bloodied. So Gavin needed a SL 4 to heal it, meaning a roll of +2 with his Adept First Aid. He failed the roll, which means the Harm sits there, until someone comes in and rolls a SL 4.<br/><br/>Two implications I draw from this:one, that there's no such thing as gradual healing--you either make a successful heal check (for that Harm level), or you don't. You can't reduce a wound by degrees until it goes away. The second implication is that healing a Broken or even Bloodied person is really, really hard. Broken requires SL 6, which means a Master healer rolling maximum success, +3. That's. . .really harsh. Is that by design? It would seem to indicate that a PC who becomes Broken is in for a looooong and rough convalescence. I can't say I <i>entirely</i> dislike that outcome, but it seems a bit dodgy.<br/><br/>2) It occurred to me that there's somedegree of overlap between Sense Danger and React. Is Sense Danger really a viable Ability with its own range of effectiveness, when an equalrank or React would appear to let you do the same thing? Or is it that Resist can't be used to initiate action? Which raises further questions: Just exactly how do you "initiate action" by Sensing Danger? And while I made a big dealin the OP about TSoY being proactive and players needing to declare their own Ability checks. . .am I supposed to be using Endure, React and Resist in a more GM-initiatory fashion, by calling on players to roll them as appropriate? Like in D&amp;D, "everyone make a Will Save"?<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108471/#Comment_108471" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-15T19:26:37+00:00" title="November 15, 2007  7:26PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joel, reading the text on page 43, revised cartoon cover edition, literally it appears that your ruling is correct.  But after the crocodile-mangling scene is over (which involves Bringing down the Pain), presumably the Harm track telescopes down, so that guy's Level 4 Harm becomes Level 1, assuming he wasn't previously injured.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf no Bringing Down the Pain was involved, the text is ambiguous.  (It's not even clear you can <i>suffer</i> Harm, in a mechanics sense, outside of BDTP - maybe it's just penalty dice and fiat.)  But if the guy had a Level 4 harm that didn't shake down immediately after the scene, he could then initiate a BDTP against someone else, throw the fight immediately, and <i>then</i> it would shake out.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I guess getting hurt makes you crabby and puts stress on your relationships?  Or having a fight with your girlfriend makes you likely to pick stupid fights with guys bigger than you...)<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that the player (or NPC) could try to self-heal as well, spending a bunch of pool points gradually over time.  Again, the text is ambiguous whether each pool point spent reduces the Harm, or if it's a threshold you have to hit.  ("Okay, 3 yesterday, and 3 more today, makes 6 - bingo, I'm completely healed.")  I'd say not, but that's me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as Sense Danger goes, my understanding is that Endure/React/Resist are meant to be analogues to D&amp;D; style saving throws, all about the character being the "direct object" of someone else's action.  Sense danger would be the proactive verison of React, the way Athletics and Counsel are the proactive versions of Vigor and Resist?  I don't know.  I kind of dislike the "saving throw" analogue; the innate abilities were a little more useful in the original version of SOY.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108482/#Comment_108482" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-15T20:31:41+00:00" title="November 15, 2007  8:31PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I use Endure/React/Resist as passive checks whenever I want to throw in poisons, reflexes or a harsh environment.

So maybe they're all in the middle of a jungle and they get the feeling they're being watched. The player and I hash out stakes like 'Fail and you're ambushed. Succeed and you realise there's a Khale cell after you.' <br><br>I might also let the group know full well there's a Khale cell. So the stakes could be anything, included 'Fail and you're captured' and 'Succeed and you're well placed to ambush them'.

In this game whenever I included Harm in Stakes I made it "Harm equal to success level" which I think makes a nice default, though you're still free to assign greater for special cases.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite>Note that the player (or NPC) could try to self-heal as well, spending a bunch of pool points gradually over time.

One thing to note is that if someone's laid up (like bedridden) as a story-reflection of the mechanicl Harm effect, that could limit their chances to refresh. But even so, buying down three points of Harm could make someone else's Heal check a lot easier.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite>the innate abilities were a little more useful in the original version of SOY</blockquote>\nReally?

Hence, if I had the Crocodile sneak upon a PC without giving them a React roll, then I'm jerking them around, but having the croc grab an NPC, without the PCs acting directly toprevent it, is totally fair game.
