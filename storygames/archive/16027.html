And then increase the energy of the game.<br/>- Sit back and see the players set things on fire. Actually enjoy it.<br/>- Have default spotlight and pass it along.<br/>- Keep secrets and make big reveals out of them.<br/>- Narrate stories with the help / creative input of the players<br/>- Improvise<br/>- Help players (sometimes just by allowing them) to bring the unexpected to the table.<br/><br/>Aside from the social things like<br/><br/>- Host &amp; organize games.<br/>- Help everyone have a good time.<br/><br/>that also players do in their own way.<br/><br/><br/>On the same fashion we could generalize some of the things that GMs prefer:<br/><br/>- Less meaningless rolls and rules, more action.<br/>- Have players invest in the story instead of destroying or just looting XP from it. (in story-driven games only)<br/>- Sharing GM rights when the system makes it possible and doesn't affect the speed of the game.<br/>- No NEED to prep to play, but being able to prep something that could make the game more interesting.<br/>- And a large etc.<br/><br/>Now that I read just these things (I'm sure there's still more) I realize that most of the games I've read doesn't tell GMs that this is what you can expect from / do in a game. Most of this you can only<br/>learn from experience and by reading enough gameplay examples/ listen from other groups anecdotes. Is this the reason why, while some parts of GMing are obviously fun, there are others that are considered a chore? Is this the reason why sometimes players feel like they have to make the sacrifice of being a GM for the sake of everybody's fun?<br/><br/>Has anybody read any book state these things as something that is actually enjoyable and not something like "As a GM It's your duty to..."? Was it helpful? Did it took some pressure out of you, made you want to GM that game more than others?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365258/#Comment_365258" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-05T10:22:13+00:00" title="March  5, 2012 10:22AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 5, 2012 10:24AM by DannyK.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like systems that make it easy to solicit and incorporate player input.

It's why many prefer to play than GM. It's why more people play video games than table top RPGs (not GMing, just playing!). It's why more people watch TV than play hardcore video games. Casual video games have grown in large part because they're easy to learn and play. As we know, the rewards from active participation are more compelling than passive, so as the bar to entry (difficulty and effort to play) lowered more people are drawn in because even though it's more work than something like TV.<br/><br/>I'm not saying it's laziness, but more work means more risk. Most often the excuse I hear is "I wouldn't be good at it."  There's not really a guaranteed safe space to learn how to GM. If something goes wrong and the game isn't fun, then you may be facing down a table full of unhappy players. So, you either need not to care about that, or have confidence in your ability, or trust that the people who you're playing with are good enough friends that they'll help the learning process. I've met some very comfortable and confident players who simply do not want that responsibility. Some gamers I've talked to believe the GM is fully responsible for 50% (!!!) of the "fun" in a game. On top of that, the GM is in the spotlight for hours with little chance at a respite.<br/><br/>I'm definitely more drawn to games that outline the roles a bit better. Though more than that, I'm drawn to games that take away power from the GM as the ultimate authority, with the power to change the game on a whim (which is actually explicitly power granted to the GM in some games).  Of course, extremes of this are games like Fiasco and Penny for My Thoughts. And you might even say that everyone is a GM in those games. It's interesting that it seems to be easier to get games like that going.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365302/#Comment_365302" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-05T13:03:20+00:00" title="March  5, 2012  1:03PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 5, 2012 1:03PM by thadrine.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><b>The mouths of my Players:</b><br/>Because we are lazy, un-creative, and seldom know the rules.<br/>I don't think it is entirely fair, but in my experience a lot of people just have trouble coming up with anything.

There are definitely games out there that are GM-less, or GM-lite, or share responsibilities in a way that make GMing not very much more difficult at all than being a normal player.  But some people don't want to be GM's, and nothing in the world is going to change that for them.  To be honest, that's okay.<br/><br/>"Different strokes" and "tastes differ" are accurate, if pithy, ways to explain that.  The best idea I can come up with -- and I offer this with no promises that it would actually work -- is simple exposure.  Get players involved in as many different games, with as many different modes of thinking, and styles of GM, as possible; and if you run the game with the explicit intent of warming other people up to the idea, play with an open hand.  Explain, if not while you're playing, then at least after you play, the thought processes and the decisions that you're making.  If someone sees something they like, a game they'd like to run that suits their style, they'll be happy to do it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/StephaniePegg" title="StephaniePegg"><img alt="StephaniePegg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/185/n6ACKVL4YBWQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/StephaniePegg">StephaniePegg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365417/#Comment_365417" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-05T18:46:03+00:00" title="March  5, 2012  6:46PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>This tangentially leads to the biggest fear I've seen from players I've gamed with who don't want to GM:  they're afraid of the increased cognitive load.

It's not smarts, exactly, because I think that I'm reasonably bright, but my spacial awareness sucks which means that tracking 4 or 5 different people plus NPCs in space for three hours feels like a chore, and the way my attention span works is that sometimes I want to be front and centre in the spotlight, and sometimes I want to recede into the background and be audience for the other players (or wander off and get a cup of tea).  GMing a tabletop game feels like you've got to be front and centre the whole time.  GMing a <i>larp</i>, on the other hand, works out well for me, because people are really where their characters are so no spatial issues, and if you set the game up right you can spend a lot of the game either enjoying the show or playing NPCs with short periods in the spotlight and then go take a break.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus" title="nikodemus"><img alt="nikodemus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus">nikodemus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365447/#Comment_365447" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-05T22:48:46+00:00" title="March  5, 2012 10:48PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roger</cite>nsofar as, when comparing being a GM to being a player:<br/>1.

I have no actual data, but I think this group is a relatively small one.<br/><br/>There are people who <b>think</b> they don't like GMing. Maybe they would and maybe they would not -- they've never tried, but their perception of GMing is such that they have zero interest in running a game. They know their tastes, and GMing doesn't smell like anything they would want to taste. I think this is the bigger group.<br/><br/>I think the smells that GMing have are somewhat false.<br/><br/>- Many game texts over-emphasize the responsibility and the amount of preparation.<br/><br/>- Many game texts over-emphasize socially dominant aspects of GMing, and under-emphasize the facilitator aspects.<br/><br/>- Many game texts give no direction how to give the GM feedback and validation. This results in many people seeing GMs as doing a good but relatively thankless job.<br/><br/>- There is a boatload of mystique associated with GMing, and the interwebs are full of bad advice. Most of GMing guides are not worth the paper they're printed on. AW has the right of it: good trad GMing has a few relatively simple procedures at the heart of it, but instead of spelling out those procedures most everyone who isn't Vincent that writes about GMing seems to be intent on barfing forth the weirdest things.\n<blockquote>So, decreasing the cognitive load could do the trick? I don't think I could design a game for "That Guy" to GM. But what about other players? Can it be made so it doesn't feel like a sacrifice? What can be done about GMing so it doesn't feel like work, like a responsability? I think the mechanics for this are already working out there, but no design philosophy has focused on that yet. I'm wondering what the possibilities coud be if a game were to be designed thinking about how it could be more fun for any player to GM.</blockquote>\nI strongly believe clear procedural guidelines, less emphasis on the prep (and pre-made good-and-easy-to-run introductory content), and less waxing rhapsodic would help more people try GMing. Some of them would like it, others would not.<br/><br/>Ie.

I know that what I'm looking for it's nothing groundbreaking, but it's something I haven't seen often and miss a bit:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nikodemus</cite> Some day I'd like to see a trad game that talks about no-prep GMing as the default mode, and mentions prep as "if you want and have the time, doing this doesn't hurt" -kinda thing.)<br/></blockquote>\nJason, I assume your wife had a sort of trauma with hot sauce. If that's true you're right, and I'm sorry: it's irreversible. Perhaps she's got a sort of permanent damage of her taste for hot sauce receptors or perhaps it's something genetic. Either way if you are worried why she doesn't like hot sauce, you should consult with a physician. However if it's just that she hasn't found a hot sauce she likes (I can only reccomend a few peruvian dishes like Papa a la Huancaina or Ocopa) that's a different issue.<br/><br/>Definitely, trad GMing isn't for everyone. It would still be more appealing if at least rulebooks didn't treat it like "behold the power of the GM for she's been chosed among all players to bring celestial fun for all on the table, and she will suffer for it and gain the hate of all players with the sweat of her forehead" but more like "You are the GM and you get to do all that players do x 10 and more!" Sorta. But that would be a placebo. Corebooks explaining why GMing is fun it's a start but it's not enough.<br/><br/>I'm going back to what Roger brought:<br/>"The social footprint is more oppressive" - Means GM doesn't only have to be every session all the time, she's got prep to do between sessions. Parts of that prep are going to change according to whatever that players did in the last session. Some GMfull games can adress this, though most of those doesn't work for long campaigns. Anyway, not that people who find the social footprint too oppressive would play long campaigns. But a design or a setting that could give better explanations about PCs coming in and out of the story for short periods of time could help a bit there.<br/><br/>"The procedures of play are more counterproductive" - means whatever a player does affects mostly his play and perhaps has some impact on the group from tiem to tume, but everything the GM does affects the whole game experience. Again, GMfull games seem like having their origin there somewhere.<br/><br/>"The content is more opaque" means that while players need to learn only the core mechanics and those that refer to their PC and know the basics of the setting, the GM has to learn the wole core book and all the setting, plus develope content of their own. Of course, once the GM is past this stage the game can flow like water and everybody can have tons of fun. Minimalistic rules and incorporation of player created content are the tools I've seen that are used the most against this issue.<br/><br/>Jim - for me that's one of the reasons why RPGs aren't more popular: you've got to see/read an actual play not only to see why it's fun, but to understand how it works. Learning the game right out of the box without previous experience is a lot harder. I still think that's because while the part of the players is easily understood (and it's the focus of every RPG book preface) the part of the GM is still shrouded in mistery about the methods used to bring the fun to the table, which hasn't been mentioned in rulebooks until... well practically until indy games appeared, for what it seems. <br/><br/><br/>I find this quite interesting:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: StephaniePegg</cite> the way my attention span works is that sometimes I want to be front and centre in the spotlight, and sometimes I want to recede into the background and be audience for the other players (or wander off and get a cup of tea).

Of course, maps and miniatures help overcome this barrier but they come with -oh no! more rules. LARP seems to be an obvious choice there and perhaps some of the elements of LARP should be included in tabletop designs as well (?) Perhaps a game that doesn't depend on defining precise spatial situations would be more appealing to GMs with different abilities.<br/><br/>Nikodemus - that's exacly what I was looking for.

But if there's some people who don't like it for, say, only a couple of reasons, would it hurt us to listen to them and see if we can change something in a product we would like to sell or an idea we would want to share for free?. Your wife is happy not having hot sauce, so there's nothing to do there but keeping the hot sauce away from her. My concern is for GMing, if there's a way to design a game in a fashion that makes it feel like:<br><br>-It's not a responsability over the fun of other people.<br/>-It's fun in itself.<br/>-You don't need to have years of experience in this game and/or others to GM it.<br/>-You don't need to be an accomplished entertainer.<br/>-You don't have to prep for it, but it doesn't hurt if you do.<br/>-You don't need to keep track of everything in abstract while trying to make the story work.<br/><br/>I feel this isn't only possible, it's probably been done before; perhaps more than I know.  The tools are already there, it's nothing groundbreaking but I also feel like it's something that doesn't get paid enough attention. I feel like a lot of games I've been reading are designed only for the use of experienced GMs and players, entertainers, incredibly creative people, tactical geniuses, impro actors, etc; and that while you can still play the game and have some fun, you'll never tap into the full possibilities the game has to offer unless you're in one of the categories mentioned before.<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite><cite>Posted By: WarriorMonk</cite>. Of course, maps and miniatures help overcome this barrier but they come with -oh no! more rules.</blockquote>\nI wish the whole concept that minis and map usage necessarily comes with a burdensome amount of extra rules would just plain die in a fire.<br/><br/>It saddens me that with all of the things we've collectively discovered that we can, by choice, dispense with in rpgs, people still take it as axiomatic that minis+maps must inherently draw from one particular design-tradition.<br/><br/>My apologies for that. I didn't mean to be axiomatic, it's just that I can't help but relate both things because of an old D&amp;D war mental injury I have. I'm aware that the usage of maps and minis doesn't mean complexity (it's exactly meant to do the opposite, simplify spatial abstraction to a tangible level) but I'm not in favor of it when it gets in the path of the story/interest of the players/gm/overall fun. But that's a matter of personal taste that I don't want to address to.<br/><br/>Entertaining others is fun.

I'm motivated to go there because that <i>is</i> playing to me - being a protagonist is about making story, not reacting to it. This is something I'm probably more comfortable doing than others because of my GMing experience, but I don't think it falls outside of rules. I get to narrate what I do, right? So I'm going to do it.<br/><br/>And it's definitely something that works best with other players that have the same intentions - in the AW instance I played alongside alongside of more traditional gamers, and often failed to intersect with their stories - they were in 'party mode' and treated me like an antagonist. It's a loose and fast style that threatens to steal spotlight from less outgoing players and to destroy any GM plot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Domon" title="Domon"><img alt="Domon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://forumtgmonline.futuregamer.it/customavatars/avatar10232_0.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Domon">Domon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366517/#Comment_366517" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-11T05:12:24+00:00" title="March 11, 2012  5:12AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Posted By: JDCorley&lt;/cite&gt;But entertaining others is fun!&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nyou're still gonna enternain others in a rpg even if you are not required to by social pressure. hell' you don't even need to be that "special" guy called GM...<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">The hell?

Because it's largely a GMless and prepless game, it's not threatening in the same way that GMing is.  That said, it does put you in a position of making sure people understand the rules, making sure everyone is having fun, keeping an eye on pacing, and having people look to you to arbitrate.  Great beginner's gig.<br/><br/>Second, I'd suggest (as I often do) offering to GM a PbF game.  There are always tons of people looking to try out any given game, even if only online.  You have plenty of time to think about what you're doing, look up rules, or ask the forums for help.  If things start to go pear shaped, you can ask your players what's going wrong without disrupting the flow of play and the worst that will happen is that you learn from your mistakes and start again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366774/#Comment_366774" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T08:33:34+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  8:33AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><cite>Posted By: Suna</cite>I am only referring to those game where on the shoulders of the GM alone lies the responsibility of determining How Things Happens in Fiction</blockquote>\nNo such games exist - every RPG I know of has players who decide what their characters do.<br/><br/>False. Any traditional game works that way. You may say what your character <i>wants to do</i>, but the GM can negate the action. If I say 'i open the door' the GM only can say 'it's locked'. And no player can by system and rules avoid that.\n<blockquote>Or, to put it another way:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Suna</cite>I am only referring to those game where on the shoulders of the GM alone lies the responsibility of determining How Things Happens in Fiction</blockquote>\nName three.</blockquote>\nVampire, D&amp;D, GURPS.

Marshall made an interesting point about "facilitated" games being an entry-level experience for those who find GMing a hardship, or potential hardship.<br/><br/>It's a shame to let good talk be buried under bad.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366807/#Comment_366807" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T10:35:15+00:00" title="March 12, 2012 10:35AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, back to work then. I totally agree with Marshall. The design I'm working on is, of course, gmless and prepless. As Fiasco, it will also like to give players the option of doing prep and also of having one GM on the table if they like it. I also found really useful Ethan\xb4s feedback, and I'm looking for a way to allow players to frame an scene about hot their characters get one step closer or eventually reach their objective, for an End game. Most probably this could be purchased with an amount of plot points, etc.<br/><br/>What I mean is that this has been really inspiring and I really want to thank you all. I'm preparing a big post about other issue, but if anybody has another idea of why people prefer playing to GMing and how could it be reverted, you're most welcome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366813/#Comment_366813" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T10:51:41+00:00" title="March 12, 2012 10:51AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It occurs to me that I never actually said why I prefer playing to GMing.  I guess now is as good a time as any.<br/><br/>For me, play is almost theoretical for a couple of reasons: 1) with the exception of Dreamation last month, I haven't played in any capacity for 10+ years, and 2) when I was playing, I was almost always GM.  As is probably the case with many folks, I discovered pretty early on that if there were specific games I wanted to play, I had to run them myself, which pretty much ruled out ever being able to participate solely as a player.  On those occasions when I <i>did</i> play, I found that the GMs I had weren't taking my input as a player seriously (or at all), and so I felt sidelined creatively.  Back to GMing, then!<br/><br/>What I really wanted from roleplaying games all along was the ability to have a character and mold that character through play.  When it became clear over the years and years and <i>years</i> of constant GMing that I wasn't going to have this opportunity, GMing became an onerous task.  Eventually I stopped playing altogether.<br/><br/>So for me it's not so much a function of anything a GM is responsible for that turns me away from GMing, but rather me being put into a situation that makes me unhappy.  It's what I get for being picky, I suppose, because if I wanted to play D&amp;D I would be spoiled for choice, game-wise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366885/#Comment_366885" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T13:10:56+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  1:10PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2012 1:11PM by WarriorMonk.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't recall exactly in which indie game I readed this: In the character creation chapter,instead of having the GM just ask "What's your character objective?" it also used the question "What do you want from the game". Perhaps it also stated this in the text but I interpretated this also as "What would you want your character to accomplish in the game"<br/><br/>The idea blew my mind. <i>So, you could present the players a setting, ask for their input and build the story from there? Up to this level? Great! </i><br/>For me this also means players get to invest more in their characters and the story, and instead of (sometimes) kicking the GM and everybody out of their fun to have theirs, now every player gets to add his own fun to the mix.<br/><br/>Sam, what do you think of that? could it had worked for you as a player?

It's like <i>Apocalypse World</i> says, the characters are fucking hot and they should be utilized in that way.  "Make the characters' lives not boring" is another commandment from AW.  It would have been well-taken by the GMs under which I played way back when.<br/><br/>As a GM, I definitely see the wisdom in learning from the players what <i>they</i> want, because if what they want and what I provide does not mesh, it's best to pull the plug before things ever get started.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Ok, GMing is fun.

I'm not sure if that's possible, but will be keeping my fingers crossed for you <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I'd like to note, though, that in my experience GMless games aren't that much of a solution to the problem (encouraging people to run/facilitate more games by lessening the burden of running the game). I haven't yet seen or participated in a truly GMless game, other than solo games ran with Mythic GM Emulator. I played stuff like Fiasco, Hell for Leather, Montsegur, Witch and A Taste for Murder. In all of these effectively everyone is a GM, and playing in all of them required significantly more mental effort than playing in a traditional game. (They were also generally more fun, but we're talking about effort here).<br/><br/>Sure, the burden is then theoretically distributed equally among all players, but if you have people who just want to consume, to be taken for a ride, or who don't want to be in a spotlight, they won't facilitate gmless/gmfull games either, because that's not the experience they're looking for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367170/#Comment_367170" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-13T11:07:30+00:00" title="March 13, 2012 11:07AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sam, good pint there. Though I feel it's not only good to know that the player wants to be a hero (or a villain insome cases) but it would be best to know what kind of hero and what kind of scene would be the best for every player. First I was kind afraid it could spoil the surprise at the end of the story, but whenever you play an RPG you can tell from the genre references what kind of ending it could have, and the real surprise comes in the way you reach that ending.<br/><br/>I just adore the way good GMing is engraved in the very rules of games such as AW. Not every GM has all the good instincts to become an awesome entertainer, and some even go into GMing still thinking as players that reached a new epic god level. That never ends in a good way.<br/><br/>Your english is fine, Alejandro, mine is a disaster. To relate your design to the discussion here, does GMing in your game feels like a chore? it bears any responsability on the player GMing over the fun on the table? If not, your design won't have any trouble at all. If it does, perhaps some players will love to be the GM and others not depending on their personality and talent for it.<br/><br/>And that reminds me of one of the interesting things I've seen about rotating GMs: It can generate a sort of competition. In an early test of my design one player framed an scene where other PC got ridiculized. We all laugh, and when it was that player's turn to GM, of course he went for revenge, framing another ridiculous scene. Soon everybody' was at each other's throat and making short lived alliances and then betraying themselves. It was fun, though it wasn't what I intended. It doesn't happened in every game, in some we managed to actually make a collaborative story telling exercise. Some personal mood factors made the difference in each session, though if the game provides an interesting enough setting it has more chances to become an story instead of a vendetta.<br/><br/>Jane, thanks for the good wishes. I know that a game that appeals to all is possible, though it can't certainly be a really good game. That's why I'm just trying to make a fun game for me and my group of players. The current version has many different uses, though. It's a way of learning how to frame scenes and improvise and it can also show the players that everybody can get their fun out of the game without stepping on each other's fun. By reading some GMfull games I also found that even with proper tools for framing scenes, not everybody in the table becomes a good GM instantly. <br/><br/>Good GMing takes time to learn, can be learned out of neccessity but only flourishes when there's a true interest for it. It also benefits from the inherent talents and other interests of the individual (writing, acting, etc) as well as their interaction with the group. When it's present it's an asset that shouldn't be ingnored by the game design, however it's ignorance shouldn't stop a group of players from having fun with tabletops RPGs.<br/><br/>Let's just say that in this design of mine, framing an scene is as easy as drawing three cards, choosing one word from each and organizing them into a phrase. With the proper list of words, combinations can be creative enough and the mechanic doesn't seem to be much of a burden. With some practice players learn to do it quick enough and even if they don't they can always use the help of the rest of the players to frame the scene. It's quite mechanical and it doesn't match the feeling of having an experienced GM frame an scene for you; nonetheless, it has the basic intention of it. Not that hardcore traditional players will love it, of course, but again, there's no way to make a game to please everybody :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367180/#Comment_367180" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-13T11:28:14+00:00" title="March 13, 2012 11:28AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most people aren't sadists(I hope).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367201/#Comment_367201" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-13T12:13:20+00:00" title="March 13, 2012 12:13PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You see? my english is terrible.
