Partly simply because they take up less room, partly because they are easier to transport to the gaming venue, partly because they just look sort of neat.<br/><br/>I don't find them harder to reference, if the internal layout is uncluttered and there is a decent index.  I don't think size, within these parameters, matters.<br/><br/>What does impact is other details, margin width for example.  I did not buy Seventh Sea precisely because the margins were so large they left the actual text squished in the middle, that made it look cluttered to me and hard to read.  Thus that format reduced the books usability for me.  Similarly, when Chaosium released the new Keeper's Compendium they included huge margins with art in them, again it made it harder for me to use the book.<br/><br/>So, size does not impact my usage greatly, digest size if anything improves usage for me and creates for me an illusion of accessibility which the game may or may not deliver.  Large margins reduce usability for me.<br/><br/>Similarly, multiple fonts reduce usability, as they make the page busy.  Art buried within text, so that the text moves way for that art again breaks flow.<br/><br/>Tables need to be clearly laid out with good use of space and a decent size, I have lousy eyesight and we frequently game in places with lowered light levels for mood.  Small print in tables means I can't read it, which is not ok.  <br/><br/>But generally, size is not the issue.  Clean, uncluttered layout with a good balance of text to space is key.  PTA for example is a model for me of good layout in many ways (or I'm forgetting the bad ways I suppose).  BW is clean, easy to read and not overfussy.  <br/><br/>Is that the sort of thing you're thinking of?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69991/#Comment_69991" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-17T09:03:49+00:00" title="May 17, 2007  9:03AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 17, 2007 9:05AM by Thor_O.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>First of all, Thor, will BW<i>fit</i>in 128 letter-sized pages?

It would actually come out to roughly 150 pages in a "traditional" letter-sized book. For anyone reading this thread who hasn't seen Burning Wheel, it comes in two 303-page digest-sized books. One is the system book and the other is the Character Burner.<br/><br/>It is my understanding (I wasn't around for this choice) that Luke chose the form he did for several reasons:<br/><br/>1. It harkens back to the early form of role-playing games.<br/><br/>2. He found the traditional letter-sized books unwieldy and the digest size much more aesthetically pleasing.<br/><br/>3. The digest-sized books fit nicely in the hand and are easy to carry around.<br/><br/>Further, it was split into two books and organized the way it was for ease of reference in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69992/#Comment_69992" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-17T09:05:05+00:00" title="May 17, 2007  9:05AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is an awesome, awesome topic.<br/><br/>I see no reason that my book on "writing better characters" should be digest-sized while every goddamn gaming book under the sun is 8.5 x 11.<br/><br/>Of course, I hate art, which is what I assume is a major factor in keeping gaming books in the size they are.<br/><br/>I like gaming books that are meant to be used.

However, I am a firm believer that while I like the shape of The Brick (Burning Empires), it would have faaaar better benefited from a larger size. Maybe not "A4/Letter", but definitely larger than what it is. There's simply too much flipping back and forth to read the rules, especially in the lifepaths sections and combat/duel of wits section.  For a one-time readthrough, the design works. But as a source that has to be referenced in play, I find it much harder and frustrating to use.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70019/#Comment_70019" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-17T10:43:13+00:00" title="May 17, 2007 10:43AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My biggest problem with these small format books is that they can't be made to stay open.

Most people would cite scripted combat as the complex part of Burning Wheel, but you have the option to use more simplified resolution, which turns the basic mechanics into a very simple game. However, the lifepath system is not optional, if you want skills and traits, and there is not much of a pattern that I can see that would enable you to guess, based only on the name, what skills or traits a particular lifepath will grant, or what a trait will actually do. This means You have to look up multiple lifepaths and multiple traits to properly burn a character, and may have to look them up again when facing specific opponents. That's OK, if everyone buys into that level of complexity, but let's not pretend that it doesn't make Burning Wheel a complex game. Maybe not D&amp;D 3e's level of complexity, more like AD&amp;D 1e (or OD&amp;D without the scripted combat.)</p>\n<p>Does format affect other opinions? Certainly. But mainly in terms of usability and perceived value. Small form-factor books are  easier to tote around, fit into bags, and feel heftier (and thus more valuable) than they would if they were a larger form factor. However, sometimes you need the larger form factor. I would love to put the dungeon crawl game I'm developing into a digest size, because that feels right for this game; but I'm using a technique where players roll dice on a special sheet and determine some results based on where the dice land. This makes the size of the special sheet important: it should be 8 1/2 by 11, since that's what I'm using to test the technique, This means that if I go with digest size, customers can't just photocopy the sheet; they either have to use a copier that allows enlargement or download a PDF and print the sheet to the proper size. I'm undecided which way I want to go with that. In some other games based on the same technique, I may even want to avoid photocopying and let the players roll right on the page in the book, which may make a large, spiral-bound form factor the better choice.</p>\n<p>In general, I want to follow the advice Kibo gave me: a game book should not only be fun to look at, but fun to read and use. Fun to look at sells books, but a lot of games aren't fun to read and use, which is why they aren't.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70041/#Comment_70041" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-17T11:46:39+00:00" title="May 17, 2007 11:46AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 17, 2007 11:49AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Edited to note cross-post with John]<br/>\n<br/>\nTaking another tack on this... I think that Burning Empires is, no matter how you cut it up, pretty complex. I'd be surprised to learn that people find BW daunting either in form or rules. But BE is daunting on both.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, perhaps not complex in that you have lots of arcana to dig through every time you want to do something. It's complex in that the system requires you to refer to it for parts of the play process that most RPGs do not require.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's the next scene? Usually that's just GM fiat. In BE, you have to carefully reference where you are, and what the scene type is going to be, and what the current dispositions are to be sure that you're going for the right sort of scene, etc, etc. Even deciding what the next scene is going to be can be mechanically intensive in terms of the choice made.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that's just one part of play. BEhas rules to be checked whenever you want to gain an item of equipment. Special rules for contacts and what is produced from them. I could go on and on and on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe perception problem is not, IMO, only from the form of the book. BW is a complicated game to play. Period. Perhaps one of the most complicated ever.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot in the sense that it's difficult. Just that it's involved. They say of Go that it's easy to learn, difficult to master. BW is not precisely like that, not quite that elegant. But it can be learned, and learned complete. What you can't do is get away with playing a session in which you're not doing a ton of things mechanically.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow... as it happens, I'm a junky for exactly this sort of complexity in play. I don't like "light" games where there aren't lots of opportunities to fiddle with the rules in play - or, even better, where the system requires you to consult it a lot (HQ can be fiddly, but the one thing I don't like about it is that it doesn't force me to use the rules often enough). So, for me, this sort of "complexity" is great.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people are going to see it as a whole new learning curve, however. Which it is. One I'd highly suggest people overcome as very worthwhile. But it's not a game that I would say is simple to use.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrankly, I never refer to a book in play if I can memorize everything I need from it. If I can't do so, I probably won't play. I'm pretty sure that I could memorize everything that I needed from BE after running it for a while. At which point the form of the book goes from being almost unimportant to me, to being completely unimportant. As I've said before, give me a PDF to read (oh, here I have one of BE... better yet, give me HTML) and I'm happy. I'm sure some are daunted by the shape of the brick. But they're right to be daunted so. They just need to overcome that.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70042/#Comment_70042" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-17T11:51:26+00:00" title="May 17, 2007 11:51AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Jason:</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>What's the smallest size that can be comfortably referenced in play?

Players who weren't familiar for the game could easily assume that it wasn't a "real" game.  I never encounter that reaction with a game like BE.<br><br>The funny thing is that I look at 8 1/2 x 11 games on the store shelf now and they have a negative connotation for me.  I see them and instantly assume they are some d20 or D&amp;D game that I don't want to play.  They almost feel anachronistic for some reason.  Like games of a by-gone era. <br><br>I think the 5 1/2 x 8 1/2 is a really nice format, especially with the nice "hardback" (I don't know the tech term) that The Mountain Witch used.  It "feels" like a small book and isn't overwhelmed at the table.\n<blockquote>What's up with square books?</blockquote>\nShock is the only square game book I've seen so far.  And it's certainly design-y, but for some reason the square doesn't have that aesthetic quality for me that the rectangle has.  But that probably comes from reading books for decades and being very comfortable with that form factor.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70051/#Comment_70051" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-17T12:09:49+00:00" title="May 17, 2007 12:09PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I toe the line between usability and prettiness by destroying everything that is beautiful in the world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70056/#Comment_70056" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-17T12:28:01+00:00" title="May 17, 2007 12:28PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that it depends a lot on the content and aesthetics of the book in question, ultimately.<br><br>Some games are right in certain sizes and shapes, and others are not.<br><br>I'm not sure if I have figured out how to know the difference, though.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70059/#Comment_70059" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-17T12:42:50+00:00" title="May 17, 2007 12:42PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 17, 2007 12:49PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kynn, what's a game book you really like?

I'll be honest, my biggest problem with it is not its size, its the presentation. I would have loved for it to look and feel REALLY pulpy. (Like i want it printed on yellow paper, with stains and distressed printing in it, but thats not really what we're talking about here).<br><br>I think Mountain Witch would have been nice if it was printed a little bigger, just to give it some more breathing room. I bought the PDF and printed it out. I like having a lot of margin around for that one. A lot of WHITE. Duh, it's snow, its the color of japanese death, it looks awesome. White. It was designed by JACN (i think?), if i was him i would have gone square format with tMW instead of shock:. <br><br>Speaking of... Shock: uses all those grids and stuff in it. Square makes a lot of sense thematically. Does it help the book on the user end? Not really. Does it hinder the experiance in any way? Again, not really. The square here is purely for looks.<br><br>Primitive is very small. Perhaps too small. It's small because i'm poor, and because there isn't a lot of info there. If it was digest sized it would be like 14 pages. I'm into crafty book binding, and i wanted to make something that felt different when you held it; thus it ended up the way it ended up. I would have liked to improve my gutter space (or the fact that i don't have much) but more than that, there aren't design changes i would make to the game book. Maybe the whole thing printed on a clay tablet. For me the form needs to suit the material. <br><br>Agon works nicely in its big long size. You get nice clean pages that hold info easily. Also the cover shape (and of course imagry) remind you that you liked 300(the comic), so you want this. Harper is flat out one of, if not THE best graphic designers working in the gaming field. Period.  I curse his name every day. <br><br/>D&amp;D core rule books are awesome. (NOTE: I'm only talking about the PHB, the DMG and the Monster Manuel) They feel important in your hands. If anything i wish they were even bigger. Like 10x14. Yeah their hard to get around, and yeah they're bit melodramatic in their design... but its mother fucking D&amp;D, it damn well better be big and melodramatic and a little unwieldy.

It was Burning Empires and I couldn't help but pick it up and flip through it. The great cover art certainly didn't hurt either. I was similarly smitten with the Spirit of the Century book when an acquaintance of mine brought it out. Both great-looking books.<br/><br/>So the peculiar size was a draw for me. Now, if everyone started putting out oddly sized books, obviously there'd be less of a visual impact, but I for one like variety and encourage designers to be creative. And just from a practical viewpoint, I hate hate hate trying to sit down and read the standard-sized RPG book. Fine for referencing, but awful and unwieldy for any significant amount of reading.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70077/#Comment_70077" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-17T14:25:13+00:00" title="May 17, 2007  2:25PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For my money, the state of the art for a paper reference book is the classic O'Reilly 7"x9" tech manual format.  There's plenty of room on the page for text and tables, but not enough so that your eye swims off of it.  And these books have <i>sweet</i> lie-flat bindings.  I've never had an O'Reilly break or spit out pages, and O'Reilly makes some fat books.  I bet that durable lie-flat bindings cost a few bones, tho, so maybe that's outside the price range of indies.<br/><br/>That's print, though.  For me, the new grand master of reference materials is the Pragmatic Programmer pdf series.  If you want to see what a technical pdf ought to look like, have look at their Ruby books, which are screen-optimized and comprehensively cross-linked (index, toc, keywords, code refs, etc).  They're super super easy to use, as both teaching and reference texts.<br/><br/>So, for right now, I'd have to say that my favorite form factor is "exactly like <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/ruby/index.html" rel="nofollow">Programming Ruby</a>"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70085/#Comment_70085" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-17T15:26:11+00:00" title="May 17, 2007  3:26PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kevin, thank you for the very kind words. It's easy for me to return the compliment: Primitive is a lovely object in every way. I really like the form factor of the tiny, hand-made book. Duh! It feels <i>primitive</i>.<br/><br/>Jason: You're right about Agon. It behaves strangely on a bookshelf, which invites people to display it flat in some prominent place in their home, perhaps where they serve coffee to guests. Also, the layout was designed around the concept of 2-page spreads for most of the key information, and the wide format accomodated that nicely.<br/><br/>I am a huge fan of the 6x9 hardcover right now. SotC is the perfect size. It has great heft without being too massive. Holding it makes me feel like I am holding a <i>field manual</i> -- it is meant to be carried into the wild, where I will consult it while engaging in my dangerous exploits. This is a very good thing for an adventure RPG book to do.<br/><br/>To answer Jason's question: The good thing about the letter-size format is the vast size of the spreads. You can convey lots of visual information at a glance, even if it is fairly dense. Mark Smylie's <i>Artesia</i> RPG book is a masterpiece of this sort of design. I haven't played it yet, so I don't know how it works as a reference book, but as an art object and learning tool, it's top-notch.<br/><br/>A great big table is a very good way to impart a ton of data, and you really can't do that well on the 6x9 page. Visual learners do well when they can see the big picture at once and then delve into sub sections. The digest format kind of forces you to read down the rabbit hole, taking things in bites rather than large swaths of information.<br/><br/>Another interesting format is the comic book size that <i>With Great Power</i> uses. It's an interesting in-between size that has a lot of potential, I think. If the WGP game rules had also been presented as a comic book, that would have been fantastic. I think we'll see some American games do that in the future, especially after people get a look at the manga/instruction stuff in <i>Tenra Bansho Zero</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70088/#Comment_70088" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-17T15:32:28+00:00" title="May 17, 2007  3:32PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><cite>Posted By: Kevin Allen Jr</cite>i, of course, seemingly refuse to follow my own rules</blockquote>\nYeah,<i>Primitive</i>should come with a sensibly-sized hollow book to keep it in.<br/><br/>Or a rough-hewn granite sheath with PRIMITIVE engraved on the thin side.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70090/#Comment_70090" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-17T15:40:58+00:00" title="May 17, 2007  3:40PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kevin Allen Jr</cite>I like SotC a lot.

But Mike, I think you are getting to my point rather well (although I think your comments about Burning Empires reflect the experience of someone that has read the game but not played it, specifically in reference to the scene types).<br/><br/>I've run a fair bit of HeroQuest and like the game quite a bit. I play and run a lot of Burning Wheel. HeroQuest has a lot more rules text (my book clocks in at 288 pages, 8.5 x 11). I also reference the rules text in HeroQuest quite a bit more often in play than I do the rules text in Burning Wheel when playing that game. The table with bids and multipliers and all that stuff is a must when running extended conflicts, for instance.<br/><br/>In my experience, in terms of complexity, they're roughly on par, with the caveat that HeroQuest expects rules mastery by the GM whereas BW expects mastery, or at least a certain level of competency, on the part of the other players too.<br/><br/>But to tie this back to the topic of this thread, I think there is a difference in perception of these games that is, at least in part, based on form factor. HeroQuest, I think, is seen as somewhat esoteric, but not necessarily rules dense, whereas Burning Wheel, which would be approximately 100 pages shorter than HeroQuest if it came in a form similar to HeroQuest's, is seen as a pretty crunchy system. <br/><br/>Now, I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. I, too, much prefer pervy games like Burning Wheel, Sorcerer and Dogs in the Vineyard to more vanilla games. I like to call them technical games, because greater mastery of their rules and the implications of those rules tends to create deeper, more dynamic play.<br/><br/>Furthermore, I think the way the game is perceived is beneficial to reaching our core market, which is other gamers that enjoy technical games. It is perhaps unsurprising that a sizable minority of our dedicated fans are older gamers who fondly remember brown book D&amp;D or Judge's Guild or T&amp;T or Classic Traveller and the like. These are gamers that feel nostalgia for the form factor, enjoy rolling their own settings, and also enjoy a bit of complexity in their rules. <br/><br/>I also think the perception of Burning Empires is beneficial. It would be a much less intimidating book in a traditional form factor, but I think that intimidation is probably good. I agree that Burning Empires is a complicated game (though perhaps not to the extent that you claim Mike), but I will certainly agree that Burning Empires is a demanding game. I know a number of people on this forum have tried to play it with their groups and failed. For many, the techniques which have been made into rules in Burning Empires are new or even alien. Burning Empires demands that you change the way that you play to conform with its structures. To play it as written requires that you allow your brain to accept a different pattern for role-playing games. We knew from the beginning that some people would absolutely hate it, and we hoped that some people would love it.<br/><br/>I think everything about Burning Empires' form factor is a combination of dare and threat. If a gamer finds the size of "the brick" too intimidating, the game probably would have been overwhelming to them anyway.<br/><br/>Form shapes the impressions of the user.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70236/#Comment_70236" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T11:53:49+00:00" title="May 18, 2007 11:53AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thor Olavsrud</cite>Form shapes the impressions of the user.</blockquote>\nLet's talk about this effect with other games.  <br/><br/>How does the form of three glossy 8.5x11 hardbacks shape the impression of the user in the case of D&amp;D 3.5?  <br/><br/>How does the form of three featureless, unillustrated black books shape the impression of the user in the case of classic Traveller?<br/><br/>How does a digest-sized game that ships with 40 cards shape the impression of the user?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70261/#Comment_70261" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T12:51:13+00:00" title="May 18, 2007 12:51PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I decided to do Galactic as 7 x 8.5 because of a few things:<br/><br/>1) I want a fatter page than Primetime Adventures, allowing for a little more white space and bigger art splashes.<br/><br/>2) It's half a sheet of legal paper, so I can print sample spreads and see how they look.<br/><br/>3) My Life with Master and Nine Worlds use that format, and they are awesome.<br/><br/>4) I can promote it as having 28 percent more page area than that hardback space adventure game with the worm thingies.<br/><br/>Okay, only the first three are true.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70300/#Comment_70300" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T14:09:28+00:00" title="May 18, 2007  2:09PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, I think it comes down to who the creators of these products are trying to reach. It's about form in relation to the identity of the perceiver. The forms in and of themselves don't mean much until we put them into their context.<br/><br/>I honestly have no clue about the first question. I don't know why it evolved to become the traditional format for RPGs. It wasn't always that way. Art may have played a role. It might also have just become the entrenched form by the time 3.0 was released.<br/><br/>To me, the black covers of CT suggest outer space and also mystery. The lack of illustrations remind me a bit of a technical manual and also suggest a void to be filled. I imagine it appealing to engineers, gear-heads, Ham radio aficionados, etc. It also has some resemblance to Army Field Manuals, though not in color.<br/><br/>I'll turn it around on you a little.

I think these people are pretty tolerant of variations in design but appreciate a well put together product.  I know I suggested digest, because I like the way it looks and feels, and saw a lot of products I enjoy coming out in that format.  I didn't anticipate a strong need to reference the text in play so that wasn't a huge issue for us.  Patrick, who designed the book, gave it a nice Edwardian feel to match the tone of the text, I think, without going over the top.  The form factor for the cards (peripherals and non-text components are a whole 'nother topic!) was dictated quite strictly by the economics of printing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70406/#Comment_70406" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-19T01:10:47+00:00" title="May 19, 2007  1:10AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm away from home right now, with little time to post.

And, really, at the end of the day, being able to easily read, reference, and open the book is much, much, more important than looking cute, clever, or even being portable. <br/><br/>The problem is (and I hate to say it, but I suspect that the same problem exists for several small-format games), if <i>Dead of Night</i> were to be blown up to 8.5" x 11" pages, it would fill about twenty of them (I think). And there is no way that a publisher could justify charging $20.00 for twenty pages of game. It wouldn't fly. But 224 "byte-sized" pages? That seems to be okay. Why that is, I don't know, but consumers seem to be much more worried with page <i>count</i> than <i>size</i>, forgetting that one directly impacts the other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70525/#Comment_70525" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-19T14:47:21+00:00" title="May 19, 2007  2:47PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            True.  There's a content-to-value ration that is built on expectations set with games that contain a lot of setting material, charts, tables, and other page-consuming stuff.  It's hard to persuade someone that your hand-stapled twelve letter-sized pages of distilled amazing is going to provide a play experience that justifies the price you ask.  That gets easier as you offer something familiar looking, like a professionally printed book with a binding.  It also gets easier as that value equation changes due to experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh" title="jdrakeh"><img alt="jdrakeh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/909/nZA3BEK4G6OHW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh">jdrakeh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70527/#Comment_70527" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-19T15:15:30+00:00" title="May 19, 2007  3:15PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2007 3:22PM by jdrakeh.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>It also gets easier as that value equation changes due to experience.</blockquote>\nMost folks that I know (myself included) love "awesome" regardless of size/density. The thing is, most of them (again, myself included) also aren't willing to pay 300-page book prices for 12 pages of distilled awesome. For that kind of money, those 12 pages of distilled awesome had better come shrinkwrapped with a blow job as far as the vast majority of consumers are concerned. The main reason for this, I suspect, is that distilled awesome is routinely available online for <i>free</i> -- from Marco Chacon's stuff to things like <i>Otherkind</i> and <i>Hell Comes to Frogtown: The RPG</i>. <br/><br/>When somebody starts slapping covers and inflated sticker prices on something that, for all intents and purposes, isn't much, much,<i>much</i> more awesome than things that people can get for free, consumers are going to balk. This has been touched on by Ben Lehman elsewhere, though I thnk that I'm coming down on Ron's side of that particular discussion (which is unusual). The point being that, just because you <i>can</i> publish a game for retail  doesn't mean that you <i>should</i>. That said, this idea (i.e., the idea that one should publish things commercially just because they can) is growing increasingly popular in certain sectors of the hobby community. And that scares me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70532/#Comment_70532" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-19T15:39:29+00:00" title="May 19, 2007  3:39PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Llulu's format limitations drove the size of Grey Ranks as well.</blockquote>\nI do most of my printing through Lance Williams over at Avalon, but I knew from the beginning that, being as bad with money as I am, every now and then I'd end up with orders but no books. Knowing I could use lulu to fill those orders fast was the major  reason i went 9x6.
