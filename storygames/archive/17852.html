Last night, one of my fellow players in our weekly Kingdoms of Ooo game didn\u2019t show up, so I decided to take pity on one of my friends and try to run Houses of the Blooded, a game he has wanted to play for quite some time.<br/><br/>It didn\u2019t go well.<br/><br/>Oh don\u2019t get me wrong, it wasn\u2019t a complete train wreck, but it neither sang nor danced. It limped along gamely for the two hours we played, going nowhere in particular. <br/><br/>Part of this was the book. The game is entertaining enough to read, but as a reference text it is impenetrable in the extreme. It is extraordinarily difficult to find anything in the book, even after I spent several hours one long boring Sunday laboriously adding bookmarks to the pdf. The bookmarks help but they don\u2019t solve a persistent problem, which is that vital information is scattered all over the book.  A concept will be introduced, but not explained, with a caveat at the end of the paragraph stating that if you want to learn how to use something (aspects, style, friendship etc.) that you\u2019ve got to \u2018keep an eye out\u2019 as you read the rest of the book. Considering that the book is over 400 pages long, this is an exercise in frustration. <br/><br/>Looking through the reviews online, this does not appear to be a unique issue. Almost all of reviews of the game contain the mantra \u2018if only there were play aids\u2019 but nobody appears to have made any that I\u2019ve been able to find.<br/><br/>So, with all that being as it is, our biggest issue was with Risk. In Houses, assuming you are not using one of the dozen similar but subtly different subsystems, the mechanic to do\u2026 stuff is \u2018Risk\u2019.<br/>The \u2018to do stuff\u2019 part of the previous sentence is where my group and I ran into trouble. In Apocalypse World, the context in which you use the mechanic is clearly spelled out: \u201cWhen X happens do Y.\u201d  In Houses, this is not the case. <br/><br/>It is very hazy when you should call for a Risk as the Narrator. It is even hazy as to who should be the one calling for it. Because the Wagers in a Risk can define the fiction in a substantial way, especially with Cunning and Wisdom risks, the fiction isn\u2019t informing the mechanics directly.<br/><br/>We had trouble deciding when and how Risks should be initiated. <br/><br/>For example, it might be like this:\n<blockquote>Player: I jump across to the other balcony and keep chasing Gaston. <br/>GM: That sounds like a Strength Risk. Assemble ye dice! </blockquote>\nBut it could also be something like this:\n<blockquote>Player: I want to get too the other balcony in order to continue chasing Gaston. <br/>GM: That would be a Strength Risk. If you want to do that, assemble ye dice!</blockquote>\nOr this!\n<blockquote>Player: I want to make a Strength Risk.<br/>GM: What is your Intent?<br/>Player: I will chase Gaston across the Balcony.<br/>GM: That makes sense. Assemble ye dice!</blockquote>\nLooking at the book, I think the last option is the one you\u2019re supposed to use, but it feels really awkward to me. <br/><br/>Even once we managed to trigger a Risk, we had trouble resolving it. Determining the primary effect was easy, but after that, the players had a great deal of trouble with Wagers. They kept trying to narrate or play out the results of a success without clearly defined results for the Wagers, which only added to the confusion when people would start responding to what the Wagering player was saying before the Wagers were all spent. <br/><br/>So do you clearly work out all the wagers, THEN go back and narrate the details of how the wagers play out? Do you step back from detail and just keep moving forward without narrating the details? Who narrates the details, the Narrator? The player who won privilege? <br/>We\u2019ve agreed to give this at least one more go, but I\u2019m really concerned that it\u2019s going to go badly again. Does anyone have any advice for how to play this? <br/><br/>We\u2019re having some trouble. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404010/#Comment_404010" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-18T15:04:47+00:00" title="January 18, 2013  3:04PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 18, 2013 3:06PM by JDCorley.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I think all three options are supported by the book. (I agree with you Houses of the Blooded is a jumble - Blood and Honor is simply the superior game in every way.)  When we played it was almost always option 1 and a little bit option 2.<br/><br/>If people can't think of a good Wager outcome, that's okay, just say they do it really good or not so good (depending on what side the Wager's on) and move on.  There are rules-defined Wager fallbacks for situations where it really matters (combat, etc.) <br/><br/>I do think the Wager back-and-forth does need to be done before the players really start responding, and that IS hard, but actually I find it kind of rewarding, because oh man, I've got this GREAT THING I want to say but nope, don't. Because...maybe something will happen that will give me an even better idea! Oh man, how many Wagers left?!? I gotta listen close!!<br/><br/>My understanding is that the player who wins privilege narrates the outcome of the central element and whoever wins their wagers narrates their details (to the extent there is any narration to do - really wagers should be really, REALLY brief statements, not elaborate narrations.)  The Narrator helps people lace it all together if it doesn't quite flow right.<br/><br/>I think I hit all your questions, let me know if there are more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404011/#Comment_404011" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-18T15:06:01+00:00" title="January 18, 2013  3:06PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PS "ASSEMBLE YE DICE" is something I am going to be yelling in any appropriate game from now on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JackFractal" title="JackFractal"><img alt="JackFractal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JackFractal">JackFractal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404013/#Comment_404013" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-18T15:34:26+00:00" title="January 18, 2013  3:34PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks JD, that does answer my questions rather handily.
