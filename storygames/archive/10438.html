I noticed that there were more relationships (gay <i>and </i>straight) explored at the table, that people were more cautious about how they approached gender and inclusion in the game, that I felt uncomfortable playing a gay character myself (as a largely straight man), and that some people felt weird being asked to play a suppporting character (ie, an NPC/extra) who was the gay lover of another character (whereas playing a female, an alien, a schizophrenic, a murderer... these were things we could readily ask another player to support us in playing). I noticed how surprised I was when that particular player decided to play a straight character (especially a straight character who was "visibly" straight, ie in a straight relationship, carousing with the ladies, etc).<br/><br/>...so, yeah. I've seen some of the dynamics that Alexander mentions. This stuff interests me. I'd like to have heard more in-depth exploration of the things he was talking about, perhaps focusing on fewer points so as to get further into each.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mjbauer" title="mjbauer"><img alt="mjbauer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/222/nPG4NFOY76VNT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mjbauer">mjbauer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232239/#Comment_232239" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-14T09:47:29+00:00" title="September 14, 2009  9:47AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (I also posted this on the Theory From the Closet site)<br/><br/>Good show.

For example, I've met people on all sides of the political spectrum in the U.S. who view their party or faction as being the most educated or most intelligent on average - the "thinking person's party" or what have you. There's a fact to the matter, of course - one group will have a higher average level of education than the others, for example - but this rarely factors in to these beliefs. People on these forums regularly express a belief that "story games" or "indie games" or whatever the preferred term are superior to "trad games," or at least no worse. Rarely does a regular poster here claim that oWoD or DnD are wholly superior systems to Dogs or PTA, and likewise whenever there's a flame war someone is sure to point out that at least we're not as bad as group Y, or that the hostility has positive cultural value.<br/><br/>People rationalize. It's good to confront that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phargle" title="phargle"><img alt="phargle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phargle">phargle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232292/#Comment_232292" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-14T13:45:29+00:00" title="September 14, 2009  1:45PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We have a pretty easy-going group. <br/><br/>Our ongoing D&amp;D game (which has gone through AD&amp;D2e, 3rd ed, 3.5, and now 4E) had a significant gay NPC character in the game.  The character wasn't played for laughs at all - he was a serious hero, a noble knight, an elder statesman, and eventually a good friend of the PCs.  I laid on hints throughout the game that he was gay, but the players never got it until another NPC got drunk and disclosed that tidbit of information.  It wasn't really a big deal except insofar as it added some additional depth to an already memorable character.   We also had a gay PC (a man, played by a woman, so I am not sure if it counts) who got decreed gay by the rest of the players, and then she just ran with it.  That added some additional emotional depth to a d20 Cthulhu game we were doing.<br/><br/>None of us are gay or lesbian, our gender diversity includes one girl, and that's about that.   We prefer going the Buffy route.  Saying we had a gay NPC should (ultimately) be as significant as saying that we had a blond NPC.  We also have occasional gender bending, and most of the games have romantic subplots now and then, and it works out okay.  It just kinda works, although one player does try to get under my skin by telling the female NPCs I run who are related to him "I love you" as much as possible. . . we make him play the slayer during Buffy games, so it all evens out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232300/#Comment_232300" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-14T14:32:13+00:00" title="September 14, 2009  2:32PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting interview.

But <i>rainbows</i>?  <i>Pink</i>?  It's just not me.  However, I <i>do</i> kinda understand the desire to wear your sexuality on your shirt.  If someone chooses to play with you <i>after</i> finding out you're gay, then at least that's one possible obstacle to a positive experience out of the way immediately.  When I play with new acquaintances before they know I'm gay, can I play a gay character without one player assuming I'm trying to be "edgy," another assuming I'm trying to flirt, and another assuming I'm the comedic relief?  Yes, of course, <i>with the right players</i>.  So obvious tells are practical in that sense.  But the other side of the coin is that even nice, rational people tend to take rainbows and pink shirts as screaming, "I'm a representative of the gay community -- ask me about fashion/theatre/anal!"<br/><br/>The whole issue is a little obnoxious to me, independent of which side each of us falls on.  I don't play gay characters because I want to <i>express</i> my homosexuality (as if I weren't doing that just by being me), but because it's one <i>less</i> thing I need to keep in the forefront of my mind as I roleplay.  And if I ever <i>were</i> to wear anything pink or rainbowy, it wouldn't be because I see gaming as a political assembly, but rather just so there will be one fewer turd at the table. Of course, I can only speak for myself, and I wouldn't want to do otherwise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

This was likely because they all knew each other well before we started playing. The only noticeable 'difference' was a result not of sexuality, but the fact that one of my gay players hadn't gamed before and it caused a little friction with his then-partner who was also at the table. This was nothing that I wouldn't expect from a straight couple in the same situation.<br/><br/>Sometimes I think it's better not to observe these things too closely, lest we pick up on 'signs' that simply aren't there, or fail to repeat the process adequately on the other side of the divide in order to get a proper basis for comparisson. In the last game I created, I deliberately included as part of the character creation process a point where the player must explicitly state whether their character is straight, gay or bi because it directly affects their use of seduction, and how it can be used upon them. I think that's what we need more of really, inclusion, not analysis.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232412/#Comment_232412" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-15T03:56:55+00:00" title="September 15, 2009  3:56AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just realized (once again) that there's not a single really, totally, Kinsey 0-kinda person in my gaming group.

My friend was playing the annoying little-brother type to his boyfriend's slightly older, more than slightly annoyed brother. Their interaction was spot-on and hilarious, and of course, they have great witty banter outside of game interaction as well.<br/><br/>When one of the other players, who seemed much the "trad gamer" type, exclaimed "You're just like brothers outside of the game, too!" We all nearly lost it. My friends kept composed and just changed the subject. Now, I don't know if them having actually stopped to explain to the other player that they were, in fact, very very gay would have changed the dynamic at all. I think most of the people at the table were aware of their relationship, though, and the only thing that it affected was their great in-game chemistry, which I'd expect from any het couple that also roleplayed together often and well.

There wasn't ever an issue with it, though.<br/><br/>The "gay dynamic" while playing with groups I know has really never been a problem for me, because -- well, they *know* me and I'm partnered, so the fact that I'm gay is pretty much out there on the table -- especially considering that I game a lot *with* my partner.  Though -- after reading some of the posts here, I've realized that I don't recall anyone ever playing a gay character in one of those games who wasn't actually *gay*, so I'm wondering if it's an unspoken possibility that people would feel uncomfortable playing gay in front of me.  <br/><br/>The issue of my sexuality affecting other players really only comes up for me when playing with strangers.  Like Jarod, I wonder if I can play a gay character without it being an issue -- either just the fact of the character or what it leads people to assume about me.  <br/><br/>I can remember a Dreamation a couple of years ago where I played Bliss Stage with Ben Lehman and two other players.  I'd just met Ben in a previous game of Polaris and didn't know the other two players at all (one of whom I believe was Daniel Solis).  One of the first things that came up in the game was naming the Anchors which, by the rules, are based on someone each player had a crush on in high school.<br/><br/>I was immediately faced with the issue of outing myself.  There was exactly one person I had a serious crush on in high school and he was very much a guy.  That Dreamation was my first real gaming con and I'd already felt a little weird about outing myself in "gaming culture", as it were.<br/><br/>I ended up telling the truth on that one and no one blinked an eye.  And then I ended up playing out a classic shonen-ai/boy's love story that, of course, ended tragically. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  But still, I have to say, I had reservations about taking that first step.<br/><br/>A friend of mine noted this year at Dreamation - in the PTA/Cold Sleep game we played - that he always feels that there's this underlying assumption with a lot of my characters that they're at least quasi-possibly gay/bi -- even when I'm playing a supposedly heterosexual character.  I played Tony in that game and a big part of his issues were dealing with his girlfriend.  I didn't have any issues with playing a straight guy, but afterwards, I think he might of had a point there... <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Actually -- now that I think about it, that same Dreamation I played in a game of Misery Bubblegum where I was playing a very straight jock whose issues were all about this girl he had a crush on, and feeling like I was doing a pretty good job with it, when Remi suddenly had his male best friend declare his undying love.  <br/><br/>I gotta say, that threw me. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>-d-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232439/#Comment_232439" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-15T07:45:53+00:00" title="September 15, 2009  7:45AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of my favorite games of Breaking the Ice was with Kat Miller. We each played women who fell in love. Hers was a long-time out lesbian, very comfortable with herself and her identity. Mine was newly realizing it herself, with a conservative, religious family. Her father was a minister.  <br/><br/>There was this beautiful moment in the game, where my character was angsting about telling her family or having anyone find out, and Kat, in character, gave an impassioned speech about how if people couldn't accept me as I was, how could they really be treating me with love. My heart still beats faster a bit when I think of that. My character came out to her family, taking Kat's character's hand at another wedding, in front of God and everybody. <br/><br/>I haven't listened to the interview yet.

On the rare occasions when I have played a gay character myself, you'd never tell simply because romance never even entered into the story.

Sexuality isn't very important outside of sexual situations - which account for most of our lives. We men may impose sexuality onto situations where it doesn't fit (ie making female players uncomfortable by being awkward in games (use your imaginations here) but sex really doesn't fit and when we stop sticking it where it doesn't belong life becomes much more comfortable.<br/><br/>I work in counseling and encounter this imposition in "Identifying Information". Some people will write "John Doe is a 24 year old gay white Fundamentalist Christian single male..." I write "John is a 24 year white single male who has come to counseling because of depression..." sexuality and religion are important but they don't define who a person is (that stuff is further back in a report). I want the opening document to focus on what they came in saying rather than saying "Wink, wink, they say they are depressed, wink, wink." I know for my part when people sum me up as "Chris is a 45 year old white married Muslim male..." I'm kind of annoyed. Religion is pretty irrelevant.<br/><br/>BTW the idea of sexuality being on a continuum has been in psychological liturature since Kraft-Ebbling wrote the "Psychothathia-Sexualise" back in the 1880's!

There was one uncomfortable moment in that first session with a misunderstanding.  One of the NPCs who was going to accompany our party (to make up for our lack of a PC healer) was gay, and when we as players were chatting about our group, I said something like "Well, that character doesn't really count" -- because he's an NPC, which I thought was obvious.  However, one of the other players asked, "Why, because he's gay?"  I was very embarrassed that people would even consider that I'd think something like that, so I blushed and stuttered a bit about NPCs and GMs and players, and so on.  It was just our first session, and we all didn't know each other (except for the coworker of mine who invited me there, but even he wasn't a close friend then), so that was something to work through, I guess.  After that, when we started knowing each other better, it was never an issue again. (In fact, I'm having lunch with the two tomorrow, I should bring this up and see if they even remember it <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>As for my own characters, I've played bisexual and gay characters before, including in unveiled intimate scenes (online, usually).  I tend to play them just the way I would other characters, only that their objects of affection are of the same gender; I'm not sure if I'm short-changing them that way, but it's the only way that makes sense to me.  Even though I've known a couple of gay men who were effeminate, I stay away from that with my gay characters, because I feel like I would be in danger of slipping into parody/stereotypes there.<br/><br/>Well, I do play them a bit differently when it's a big social taboo in the setting, which of course impacts everything about their person.  For example, Lisa and I made characters for a Breaking the Ice game where both "daters" are men in the Confederate army, and while we haven't gotten to play it yet, their circumstances will definitely impact how they feel about their sexuality and their mutual interest in each other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peccable" title="peccable"><img alt="peccable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peccable">peccable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232580/#Comment_232580" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-16T07:04:59+00:00" title="September 16, 2009  7:04AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

Isn't this just basic honesty?  I know a scenario this specific won't come up much: I was asked a very specific question -- REQUIRED by the game -- that was personal information about myself.  In this particular case, dealing with something like sexuality, yeah -- there are places/people that aren't 'safe' and it could have ended badly, but does that mean I shouldn't have been honest? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>(Rather a loaded question, I know.)<br/><br/>If you ask an honest, personal question of someone in a role-playing environment -- what happens when the answer makes people (possibly) uncomfortable?  Not to derail the thread, but how honest can play be when people aren't being themselves?  Or does that honesty come *after* (at the cost of?) keeping things safe/comfortable.<br/><br/>[An aside that just occurred to me -- I've known people who don't understand personal boundaries and just shove things on people for the sake of "honesty" ... that is *not* what I mean here.]<br/><br/>In response to something Chris posted:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MatrixGamer</cite>think that's really the point anyway isn't it? Sexuality isn't very important outside of sexual situations - which account for most of our lives.</blockquote>\nI disagree with that.<br/><br/>If I encounter you at work and you've got a picture of your girlfriend/wife on your desk, am I suddenly in a sexual situation?  The fact that you're in a relationship with someone and the fact of that person's gender is important.  I might argue that the search for love/companionship (or the non-interest in same) is an incredibly important part of most people.<br/><br/>Yes, a character's sexuality/gender preference is probably not going to come up unless romance or relationships is somehow involved, but I don't equate romance with sex.  Maybe that's just me. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>A lot of story-gaming is going to involve characters and their relationships.  Is noting that person's romantic relationships "sticking it where it doesn't belong"?<br/><br/>Oh -- and one thing I noted in the interview.  I think Alexander says at one point there's no gay characters in modules/adventures anywhere he's seen.  One came to mind when I heard that.  I think the example adventure in the Blue Rose RPG core book involves a young gay guy who's fallen in love with a handsome young stranger, which his local culture doesn't particularly approve of.  Rather sweet, as I remember.  The game itself also involves a couple cultures that have no issue with homosexuality, and there's even specific world-terminology that's used to identify different gender preferences.<br/><br/>-d-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kickback" title="kickback"><img alt="kickback" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kickback">kickback</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232581/#Comment_232581" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-16T07:05:04+00:00" title="September 16, 2009  7:05AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 16, 2009 7:05AM by kickback.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MatrixGamer</cite>I think that's really the point anyway isn't it?

Who is the character dating, or wish she was dating? Is he married? Is it a healthy marriage? Is she cheating? Does he fondly remember the one that got away? Does she have a pesky ex who breezes through sometimes to cause trouble? Is there a little UST with his professional partner? <br/><br/>Even if none of this comes up in game, it makes the character richer. In my current game I'm playing it that my character has a bit of a crush on another character. (Same sex, as it happens.) I don't expect it to go anywhere. I don't think anyone else has even picked up on it. But it makes things more interesting for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232595/#Comment_232595" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-16T08:21:34+00:00" title="September 16, 2009  8:21AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 16, 2009 8:24AM by Graham.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Clyde and Alexander, that made me think.<br/><br/>I like what Alexander says about hitting on a character not meaning you're hitting on a player. There does seem to be a strange frisson when characters hit on each other.

And they're all queer, or very queer-friendly.  When I think about trying to find meet new people purely for the purpose of gaming, I do feel some reticence stemming from dealing with reactions to coming out, though it's jumbled with all my other reticences (is that a word?).  <br/><br/>Most of my RP-heavy gaming has been on-line in MUSHes, where I tended to play either women or gay men.  People knew that a gay man was at the other end of the interaction, but it's an easy thing to forget when all you see are character posts.<br/><br/>I think even when sexuality and relationships aren't part of the play, people still hold default assumptions about unrevealed aspects of the characters.  I think players in a game that had never dealt with relationships would be a lot less surprised if a male character decided to woo a princess than if he decided to woo a prince.<br/><br/>I've found that even playing with other gay men can lead to some interesting collisions of norms.  I joined a Mage group composed of only gay men, and we all had relatively masculine presentations, burly guys with beards in denim.  When I joined, then other guys were all playing gay men who were generally...burly guys with beards in denim.  Just for the hell of it I made up a more stereotypical, twinkly sort of gay male character.  A good Catholic boy.  I even pitched my voice high.  They were all somewhat taken aback.<br/><br/>More often than not I'm a GM when I play, which brings up the question of where sexuality fits in the setting.  Do you pretend everyone's heterosexual?  Do you pretend that it doesn't matter to the culture, that opting to play a gay character just means a change in pronouns?  If you pretend it does matter, how does it matter?

Newman[Dewhispered cuz Dan asked me to so we can discuss<br/>\nIf I encounter you at work and you've got a picture of your girlfriend/wife on your desk, am I suddenly in a sexual situation?<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of story-gaming is going to involve characters and their relationships. Is noting that person's romantic relationships "sticking it where it doesn't belong"?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSexuality is certainly important in people (and the people we role play) but it's not the most telling thing and when brought up indiscriminately can trigger more sterotypical thinking than not. So I have relationship information further back in records (in therapy where sensitivity to prejudice and social disadvantage is pretty important). In role playing it might be the first thing said if it would be a good hook to hang a performance on. "Brokeback Mountains of Madness" for instance was by definition over the top but if the game was about say, soldiers in WWII where one of them was gay (say Biloxi Blues) gay was not put forward and as the narrator commented the gay character was the one who stood up for everyone. A game could explore the tension that person went through (It'd probably be a good game) but would it be sexual or would it be about society imposing sex on situation that it didn't fit in?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the quesitons. I do have a picture of my wife in my office as well as a calligraphied "Allah u akbar" sign. They only come up if people ask. Otherwise they aren't relevant. Now that's in real life. If it was in a game every piece of information is a hook. It wouldn't be there if it wasn't important so deciding to describe that over the Ganesha statue or the Bambara mask or the books of Christian theology on my book shelves would be a choice telling somthing about the story being told. To highlight something that isn't important would be an odd choice in gaming. <br/>\n<br/>\nNoting romantic relationships for a story could be important (Biloxi Blues again) but if that isn't the focus of the game then why impose something on a character? That should be the player's right to decide, not the GM's, or so I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will cop to being a little too flip with my response above. It doesn't have a lot to do with what I think about role playing. It's about my politics and life experience.

It takes courage to come out about anything, and sexuality is both personal (and part of the game at hand, admittedly) and something that enough people get violent about that it would concern me, were I in your shoes.

You probably blush and say something embarrassing that might even be incidentally hurtful, then backpedal, then try to make up for it by buying the guy a beer, then fumble around when you say you're not hitting on him, cuz you're totally straight, and then secretly question that. Then feel shame and announce to your friends later how straight you are and how the guy was such a fag.

It's not my identity, con fun, new friends, or neck on the line. I think it's great you were honest about it, and I'm glad it went well. I think your judgment in the matter is the only informing element of "should". I'd hope that if your judgment told you it would go badly, you'd do what would be best that netted you the best experience.</p>\n<p>Speaking of which, I had an employee come out to me once. I was on the verge of tears that he felt like he could trust me like that. I mean, he was a nice kid, and we'd talked a lot, but he didn't <em>have</em> to come out to me, and I was his <em>boss</em>. If I were a different person, I could have found reasons to fire him. It was pretty intense that he was OK being that vulnerable in the 90% business relationship we had (the other 10% being that we shared certain geekly interests and were both graphic designers in different phases of our careers). There's more on the line in a boss/employee relationship than in a casual social one at a con, but it's the same kind of thing.</p>\n<p>It's also the kind of of revealing experience that is the reason I like role-playing.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232629/#Comment_232629" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-16T11:05:39+00:00" title="September 16, 2009 11:05AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>John (and Alexander): Are you cool with folks talking in general about homosexuality in RPGs in this thread?

If the thread gets too long, branching threads may be needed to make the conversation more accessible. But I love the sharing! <br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=10349" rel="nofollow">In BLACKOUT (the game I'm designing and running every other Friday as part of the GGG)</a>, you can randomly create characters by drawing dominoes and picking suggestions from a list. The suggestions are time and location specific. For example, the suggested names are based on the top 10 popular male and female names among white, black, asian, and hispanic children in NYC in the 1990s (since the game is set in NYC on Thursday, August 14th, 2003 at 4:15pm).<br/><br/>As part of random character creation, one of the players generated a gay character. 2 of the other players are gay and decided to play themselves. So 3 out of the 5 characters are gay but in play it is only as important as any other character detail and no more so. It's not ignored. It just is. Although technically by the rules of BLACKOUT they may no longer be gay by the end of the game but the same can be said for being male, female, or even being human. The dynamic between 2 gay players playing 2 gay characters and 1 heterosexual player (who is the only female player in the game) playing 1 gay character has been very natural. <br/><br/>I have seen social status plays by people trying to seem cool and that can be lame. I'm playing a woman, look how different and cool I am. Where it should just be a very normal, human thing. Why fetishsize it? <br/><br/>That being said, when I play a gay character with gay players or a female character with female characters, I definitely feel extra self aware. Same if I was playing a different ethnicity. I don't want to play a caricature or stereotype. But ultimately I accept I'm going to make an ass out of myself at some point and look at it as a learning experience. My only hope is that my friends will prop me up when I fall rather than kick me when I'm down :-) We're all ignorant of most things till we're not cause there is just too much to know and experience. And there is a hell of a lot to learn by making mistakes and taking risks. But ultimately it's important to be aware of the social contract. If people are looking for escapism, that's going to be a very different game than full on engagement. So play needs to flow accordingly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232633/#Comment_232633" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-16T11:37:54+00:00" title="September 16, 2009 11:37AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BTW, Chris's comment, <i>"I think that's really the point anyway isn't it?

It wouldn't be there if it wasn't important so deciding to describe that over the Ganesha statue or the Bambara mask or the books of Christian theology on my book shelves would be a choice telling somthing about the story being told. <b>To highlight something that isn't important would be an odd choice in gaming.</b><br/>[...]<br/>Chris Engle</blockquote>\nChris, the bolded line makes a lot of sense.<br/>However, I think that importance is really subjective.<br/><br/>Is it important to know that my Don't Rest Your Head character (who's a drug smuggler that recently lost a shipment and is thus hundreds of thousands in debt, and can't sleep because there are hitmen after him) is gay?<br/><br/>If he's not in a relationship, and not being pursued by any romantic interests, you could say probably not.<br/>But in my head, it could make all the difference.<br/><br/>*I could imagine that he grew up in a very bigoted home, and thus always felt like he was labelled with an outsider status, and that the transit into drugs &amp; dealing was naturalized by feeling already marginalized and judged by my family.<br/><br/>*I could imagine that his first lover was an older man who was really caring and paternal, and that breaking up with him prompted my character to rebel against him almost as one would rebel against a father figure (turning to drugs, street gangs and other dangerous behaviour).<br/><br/>*I could imagine that this character was quite closeted, and that his experience of discreet gay lifestyle had normalized for him the idea that there were secret societies nestled into all the nooks and crannies of our society... which would have a huge effect on how he perceived the Mad City (probably less xenophobic, more likely to look for subtle communication differences, likely to succeed and fail in different ways than the other protagonists).<br/><br/>I don't know that these are good examples or not (DRYH was a weird choice to go with, because it implies a lot of characteristics about its protagonists - a certain grit, a certain desperation, a certain level of edginess)... but in all those cases, I might imagine this character's sexuality to have a lot of subtle (or overt) impacts on his worldview and how he sees the situations immediate to him.<br/><br/>Thinking that might have a huge impact on the character, and how he is portrayed. Sharing that might have a different impact, also huge.<br/><br/>So, to say that this character's sexuality (and in those examples I presented, more accurately: his experiences with his sexuality) didn't have a hugely formative effect sounds weird to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Iskander" title="Iskander"><img alt="Iskander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.ajnewman.net/i/eye.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Iskander">Iskander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232684/#Comment_232684" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-16T15:09:08+00:00" title="September 16, 2009  3:09PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 16, 2009 3:50PM by Iskander.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MatrixGamer</cite>think that's really the point anyway isn't it? Sexuality isn't very important outside of sexual situations - which account for most of our lives.</blockquote>\nYeah, I think you're totally wrong here, or deluded. Not in a bad way, but this is one of those <em>not gay: don't get it</em> moments, which I'll nevertheless try to elucidate. The <em>bzzzt... wrong</em> stems from the fact that almost all modern societies are still dysfunctional when it comes to sexuality in general and same-sex relationships in particular. As evidence: still, today, almost all LGBT folk have to endure some process of coming out. With that in mind, try to imagine the days, months, years or decades between the moment you think to yourself <em>"hunh, I guess I really do like smoking the pole. Fuck! What now? I know, hide! Maybe they won't hurt me,"</em>* and the fuzzy time in your life when your coming out process (which is honestly, <em>still</em> a whole fucking lifetime's worth) has pretty much plateaued, and everyone in your everyday life knows you're gay. <br/><br/>Imagine that period of time when you become painfully aware that everyone is assumed to be straight**. Every billboard is aimed at not-you. Every magazine is about a life that is not-yours. Every time you meet a new colleague, co-student or friend and as part of the normal sizing-up of <em>are we going to get along</em> they assume you're straight***. You get the picture, I hope. The entire fucking world is trying to invalidate your identity in a really passive-aggressive way.<br/><br/>So now, to take <em>peccable</em>'s example, let's hypothesize a new colleague at your workplace, who comes to your desk and is trying to form a functional working relationship with you; one that extends beyond the mere formalities of office interaction, because we're human. He's gay, and he's out to everyone in his life to date, except to you, because you're the new kid on his block. And there's the photo of you and your wife. Awesome. Yet another bloody person to come out to. Boring, but necessary, because otherwise some silly bugger will try to fix him up with a niece or sister or cousin or single girl friend. (Yes, this has happened to me. More than once.) Trust me, you end up having to come out to almost everyone, sooner or later****, and for me it got really fucking old about 20 years ago.<br/><br/>Sexuality isn't very important <em>to you</em> outside of sexual situations, because your sexuality conforms to the norm that our society presents. By and large, LGBT people just don't exist. There are more and more exceptions to this rule, thank fuck, but still: we just don't appear. It's a big deal when there's a gay couple in a print ad, heaven forfend that a national TV channel ad should have one.<br/><br/>Sexuality is significant to some of the rest of us almost all the fucking time, because we do exist, despite what the universe tells us again and again and again. <br/><br/>I'm bored of writing about this right now, and I have to go raid, but I hope this made some sense, and maybe explains why a lot of us homos actually <em>do</em> think it's necessary to "broadcast" our sexuality early in a social relationship. It's a whole lot easier than dealing with the shock and awe when you try to set me up with your sister and I throw up on your shoes.<br/><br/>So, to get back to one of the points I tried to make in the podcast, and probably lost in the noise of ranting, this is what I'm challenging setting and scenario designers to address. Even more challenging, do it without being facile or using tedious stereotypes. For game designers: can you exploit this dynamic for functional play, or do you end up with shitty psychodrama improv?<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: peccable</cite>Oh -- and one thing I noted in the interview.  I think Alexander says at one point there's no gay characters in modules/adventures anywhere he's seen.  One came to mind when I heard that.  I think the example adventure in the Blue Rose RPG core book involves a young gay guy who's fallen in love with a handsome young stranger, which his local culture doesn't particularly approve of.  Rather sweet, as I remember.  The game itself also involves a couple cultures that have no issue with homosexuality, and there's even specific world-terminology that's used to identify different gender preferences.<br/><br/>-d-</blockquote>\nGlad to hear that there's some LGBT content in modules did someone else mention some in WotC/D&amp;D published content? Refs, please.<br/><br/>* Or LGBT variations on the theme. Note: I am being flippant. My sexuality is absolutely <b>not</b> wholly about sex. If I just liked to suck the occasional cock, I'd probably be happily married to a woman and spend more time in the gym steam room. Or the navy.<br/>** Or for the majority case: a straight white male, depending on the marketing demographic.<br/>*** The obvious exception is guys who are clearly flaming and kidding nobody, which is usually a defense mechanism. Flaming == safe (and gets to have more sex with the football team, based on my entirely non-scientific homos-I-have-known survey).<br/>**** Sooner is definitely better. My office rule-of-thumb was to locate the biggest gossip in the office, chat for a bit, insert an (often completely fictional) throwaway anecdote about an ex-boyfriend, be very clear about his gender, and just let the gossip do the work.

Premarital sex is against the law (as is most premarital touching).<br/>Art depicting sexuality is against the law.<br/>Roses = banned.<br/>Because, after all, society will be much more decent and easily regulated once love is stripped from the equation.<br/><br/>In effect, straight relationships are villanized and heterosexuals are asked to be invisible.<br/>So are homosexual relationships, but that's old news.<br/><br/>The society basically says "we don't want to see it, and where possible, we don't even want you to do it."<br/>It's interesting watching people react to that, especially because in Perfect you are rebels and criminals - you react with a law by breaking it or observing it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232711/#Comment_232711" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-16T17:40:00+00:00" title="September 16, 2009  5:40PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Iskander</cite><br/>Imagine that period of time when you become painfully aware that everyone is assumed to be straight**.

Why were they depicting a <i>person in a wheelchair</i>? I understood the whole "littering = bad" part, and that showing a person littering would demonstrate the bad behaviour... But it took like 30 seconds to wrap my head around the very simple fact that they chose to illustrate a person in a wheelchair doing the littering because people in wheelchairs probably litter just like everyone else.<br/><br/>I usually consider myself a fairly open-minded person, and challenge myself not to blindly accept a white-washed heteronormative world... to try and be inclusionary... yet this poster baffled me. Because when do you see any media depicting a disabled person when their disability isn't focal and paramount?<br/><br/>This poster depicted someone who was incidentally disabled, and it caught me off guard in a major way.<br/>I watched for a minute, and others were taken aback by the poster similarly.<br/><i>It was effective because it was attention grabbing.<br/>It was attention grabbing because it was inclusive in a way that most marketing isn't.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

And I question that Alexander has no clue what it's like to require a wheelchair, or be a person of colour, or a woman.  I think it requires an act of will to *not* develop some idea, assuming you've had any interaction with "the other".  (Of course, if you've never even talked to a person you knew was gay, it's a whole different ball park.)<br/><br/>As far as how to depict a gay person, it depends on the game.  If what's of interest is not the orientation but some other stuff, then it's just color text, and as long as you're not going for a cheap stereotype you can play any way you want as far as I'm concerned.  <br/><br/>But if orientation is key, it gets trickier.  Say you want to tell a coming out story.  How do you do it if you don't know what it's like to come out?  Equally important, how do you do it if the people you're playing with have no idea what it's like to have someone come out to them?   Even if you have sufficient knowledge and empathy to create a nuanced tale of a man who finally tells his wife he's gay, the person playing the wife may not have the knowledge and empathy to join in the creation.<br/><br/>It's a common difficulty in any RP that deals with something very real.  Do you have the ability and perspective to tell a story that lives up to the reality, or are you just going through the motions?   If you're white and want to play a Moorish wizard because you think having "Ibn" in your name would be cool, there's not much there to screw up.   If you're white and want to play a black student who's going to attend a previously all-white school in 1960s Alabama, there's more to screw up.  I recoil from games with weighty themes that are about real history or current events, in part because I don't think I can do them justice.  I'm gay, and I've even been in life-threatening situations because of it, but no way you're going to get me to play a present-day Iraqi man waiting to be executed for being gay.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232846/#Comment_232846" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-17T12:18:48+00:00" title="September 17, 2009 12:18PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let\u2019s see\u2026 lots of interesting feedback that I want to respond to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI probably should clarify that there is a big difference between doing therapy and role playing. In therapy we ask lots of really probing questions, which has to be done respectfully. Sexuality is one of them and it\u2019s an important one and for some people the most important one but for others it isn\u2019t. I\u2019ve always taken whatever comes up at face value and try not to dive too deep into assumptions. Alienation is one affect of how our society treats gays in the US. It\u2019s not as bad as it once was but it\u2019s still there. I try to not create more alienation by treating one set of information as more important than others. Personally I find knowing where a person was born and raised more useful in understanding the therapeutic language that I can best help them with. I can talk \u201cFAAABULOUS\u201d, psychodynamic, CBT, Bible, Quran, White Buffalo, down home folksy, philosophy and several other therapeutic languages as needed. And I really do get about the repression piece. My brother is gay, I\u2019m a Muslim in a country that has been killing my coreligionist for 8 years, and I\u2019m a German whose family was abused during WWI. I\u2019m fairly certain I have an FBI file just like my Dad did in the 50\u2019s etc. moan groan, my life is so hard. Oh and I didn\u2019t mention the addictions mental illnesses, and suicides. Moan. And my other brother is crippled with arthritis. Groan. All that informs the work I do in my day job. I believe in transparency so if they do ask about the picture of my wife (which is next to the picture of my old cat \u2013 taped on a picture rather than on my desk) or about religion I tell them because it\u2019s public and for what we are doing irrelevant. Thus my flip comment.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeel free to educate me further but please don\u2019t bore yourself. I really do get this.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow as to games, it is a different matter. We can use games to expand perspectives in so many ways. Being respectful is not always required. My games are not about the deep emotional struggles of individuals or deep moral issues (my last game was Thunder Hamsters and the Temple of Cheese) but even so I make statements by the characters I include. <br/>\n<br/>\nI always include viable, important female characters. They make up 30-50% of the mix. (My rules don\u2019t assume weakness just because you lack a big sword).<br/>\n<br/>\nI also include positive Islamic characters. (Duh!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I\u2019ve had some gay characters in various games mainly to make use of how Western Societies crap on gayness as a dynamic for intrigue. So a character working in the government could be blackmailed in the 1940\u2019s. I\u2019ll include it if it\u2019s relevant to the story, otherwise I leave sexuality up to the players. They can make their characters suck cock if they want to \u2013 hopefully it is relevant to the game. If not and if it\u2019s bugging other players then we have a social contract issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have had one sexual issue come up in a game with bothers me to this day. I wish I had handled it differently. In a Robin Hood game a player used an action to rape Maid Marian and her servants to cow them. This was a public game that had children playing in it. In my games a referee sets a \u201cto happen\u201d roll. In this case I gave him a very poor chance and told him that if he succeeded that the King would hunt him down. His roll failed. What I regret is not saying \u201cThat\u2019s out of line. Change or leave.\u201d This was in the mid 90\u2019s when exactly what he \u201cmade up\u201d (or was it fantasizing about?) was happening in Ruanda and Bosnia. It was completely realistic but it sickened me. I don\u2019t want that in my games or for the people I run for to be subjected to it. That guy was a sick puppy who though what he was saying was right. It was disturbing and still is. Mind you \u2013 if someone came up with cock sucking in a game with children in it I\u2019d also slap them down. That would be for the adult crowd.<br/>\n<br/>\nChris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Iskander" title="Iskander"><img alt="Iskander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.ajnewman.net/i/eye.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Iskander">Iskander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232847/#Comment_232847" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-17T12:29:40+00:00" title="September 17, 2009 12:29PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some people do it very well: Luke in the example he mentioned above and Thor in the example in the podcast both spring to mind, and it certainly shouldn't be <em>verboten</em>.<br/><br/>The onus on a player is much less (and much easier to bear, I think) than what I'm volunteering for authors and designers of scenarios, settings and games. The player can simply point romantic attachments at people of the same gender. Simple, but nevertheless hard to do, in practice, without humping the legs of stereotypes. An interesting challenge: just play it the "just happens" way, and see where it goes. <br/><br/>Existing knowledge is irrelevant then: if you're a straight guy playing a dude coming out to his wife, you're roleplaying choices and exploring the resulting consequences. Isn't that what it's all about? No reaction is wrong (bearing in mind my idea of what constitutes an RPG may diverge from Joe's*), from inexperienced straight you, or inexperienced straight wife-playing-person. You get to discover, maybe, how you would feel in that situation - what would drive your choices, and how the results would feel. I can begin to imagine how shitty it would be to come out to a wife of ten years with two small kids, because the horror of that scenario was implicit in my decision to come out when I did, but I don't <em>know</em>. I'm not sure I'd want to roleplay it to find out, but it could happen.<br/><br/>There's a difference between saying "you have no idea what it's like to be gay!" (which I hope I didn't say, but might have done stupidly), and saying "hey, there's this thing you don't understand because you're coming from the straight place of privilege and power, and while I think you're able to understand it cognitively - which is why I'm pointing it out - I don't think you'll ever really grok it because it's born of long and bitter experience, but don't let that stop you trying." Perhaps games can be a way to explore that, and increase empathy between people of very different life experiences. Perhaps games like that would just be boring, although I doubt it - <em>Perfect</em> got raves, right? Haven't played it, sorry Joe.<br/><br/>I'm pretty fucking certain, though, that such games can't come to be played without a bit of nudging from authors. Why break from the default when there's no option, let alone incentive, to do so?<br/><br/>FWIW, I think this is wholly consistent with telling anyone adding <em>gay**</em> to their character sheet, or <em>buttsecks</em> to play because it's somehow edgy or transgressive to go take a running jump into a meat grinder. If you're playing a gay character or adding gay content <em>to get a reaction out of other players</em>, you're probably a dick. If you're playing a gay character or adding gay content <em>to roleplay that shit out</em>, then I will let you buy me a beer.<br/><br/>That was one of the things that stuck with me about the Conspiracy of Shadows game I mentioned in Clyde's interview. The gay content was introduced in a way that was plausible, consistent, and on some level <em>real</em>. The straight guy got to find out some of what it's like to be in total romantic thrall to another guy who didn't love him <em>that way</em>, and the gay guy (me) got to find out what it was like to be the target of that attraction and fucking his wife at the same time. The tension introduced filled a narrative (if you like) hole that made the whole scenario more concrete. (It was several years ago, now, though, so I'm probably romanticising the game. Ha.)<br/><br/>Ranty McRantPants is going to go kill people in WoW now. And explode their corpses. Because I'm that kind of cow.<br/>Laters,<br/>Alexander<br/><br/>* Like, I don't think I set out to tell stories. I like playing games where we set up starting conditions and then shit happens, and <em>oh, look!</em> a pseudo-narrative emerged.<br/>** I get bored of writing alphabet soup. I am very inclusive person, honest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Iskander" title="Iskander"><img alt="Iskander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.ajnewman.net/i/eye.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Iskander">Iskander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232849/#Comment_232849" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-17T12:40:40+00:00" title="September 17, 2009 12:40PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MatrixGamer</cite>Feel free to educate me further but please don\u2019t bore yourself.

Judd was in this with me. Napkin Girl had no arms or legs and she was a tank-top-and-panties-clad McGuffin you had to pick up and carry around for some reason. Whenever you did, the GM made you make what a friend of mine called a "boner check" (some sort of Will roll). If you failed it, the GM would describe you getting sweaty and nervous and giggly.<br/><br/>I was really annoyed by all of this. Among the many things that bothered me\u2014the least, really\u2014was the presumption of heterosexuality. I mean all of it pissed me off: the sexualizing of the girl, the passivity of it, how if you woke her up she'd scream in pain until she fell unconscious, the bad way that my friend was treated when he came up with a good idea, etc.<br/><br/>Anyway, I resolved at that moment that my character was gay, and I kept trying to be forced to make that roll, picking her up as often as I could, asking to be left alone to protect her, etc. I didn't get to roll, but if I was I had my response ready:<br/><br/>Me: "No, it doesn't effect me."<br/>Him: "Huh?

Until recently, I hadn't seen a non-anvilicious way to make those incentives; usually, they take the form of "play this kind of oppressed person because you will LEARN A LESSON!" Which is normally boring and stupid.<br/><br/>The first time I ever played a gay character, in a Fiasco game, the incentive wasn't anything to do with having a moral in our story; it was to make a character who, in the way that Fiasco demands, would suffer for the mismatch of his ambition and his resources. (I had the idea to do it this way because it made the r-map make sense, so it started out as a strictly mechanical choice, but grew to be important in the story.) Making him homosexual, and a street-level mobster in what we decided was a violent, homophobic organization, gave us the tension of him needing to screen his sexuality from the rest of his life, and it led to a really engrossing and tragic story. And I was surprised at how pervasive were the little efforts I put into maintaining that wall for him, even though his sex life only came up in conversation in two scenes.<br/><br/>I was uncomfortable making the choice to play that character, for reasons I'm still struggling to articulate months later. And I will never play the recording of that session for anyone else, because I worry that despite my best efforts, maybe I did something grossly insensitive as we looked at homophobia and violence against women. I would probably never have attempted it with a gay player at the table, for that same reason. But I hell of enjoyed that game session and would do it again the same way, and face the same discomfort, because I'm proud of the story we created.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232956/#Comment_232956" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-18T07:33:35+00:00" title="September 18, 2009  7:33AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think tourist somehow understand what the people they are visiting are going threw (and these people are in the same place and time as these people for a bit at least ) I really don't see how imaginary tourism does any better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233021/#Comment_233021" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-18T10:44:32+00:00" title="September 18, 2009 10:44AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MatrixGamer</cite><br/><br/>2.

Game designers don't include Gay characters in games. (Which is largely true but not a universal truth).<br/>\n<br/>\n2. If you aren't gay you can't really play a gay character because no matter how empathetic or knowledgable you are you're just a tourist.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what is the incentive for me as a designer to include gay characters?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe argument of specialness, impenetrability, and authenticity are very exclusive and say to me as a designer "Why bother? All it will do is get me shit from both sides." <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't buy the argument. I certainly don't want players to play stupid stereotypes but in the end when they play one of my games they will do what they do. If a gay character fits a game I'm putting together I'll include them if they don't I won't. I'll try my darnedest to give a good interesting character write up but I'm not going to be concerned about authenticity because it's a crap argument that would actually stop me from including characters rather than including them. <br/>\n<br/>\nSay I include three characters with the following write ups.<br/>\n<br/>\nBob the Accountant: Bob works at a boring job but dreams of more. He and his boyfriend watch travel shows and save money for trips they never take... that is until now. Bob is a fountain of knowledge and likes to talk. Oh, and he's a good dancer. GOAL: Have an adventure.<br/>\n<br/>\nBob the Drag Queen: Bobbie darling, you look FABULOUS! You simply must tell me where you go those shoes. I LOVE them. GOAL: Steal the bitches man.<br/>\n<br/>\nBob in the closet: Me and the wife are going to the mountains for vacation. The kids will be at grandma's. Oh... dear... I need to go into town. I'll be back... late. (God I hate myself!!!) GOAL: Act out and don't get caught.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are people like all these characters out there in the world right now. Gay doesn't mean just one experience. If a gamer was playing them they could come up with behaviors and consequences that could also be completely realistic, maybe fun, and possibly instructional, but games don't have to be realistic. That certainly lessens the education value but if it tells a good story it might be worth while.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I'm wondering is whither there is much of a cost to gamemakers (in terms of lost sales) if gay characters are used? If a character was included in a game in a low key way then probably not - but is that a prepetuation of "Don't ask don't tell"? If a game came in a big pink box with a huge phalus on it then I can't imagine most game stores wanting it but I doubt there would be much of a cost in on line sales. This would be the in your face political activist treatment that enrages rightwingers (making them more entrenched in their ways) and frightens off the uncomfortable because it's too out there for them. For those for whom it is no big deal then it hardly mattered what the box looked like. <br/>\n<br/>\nI may include some gay characters in future game - in a low key way - but just because I like diversity in my characters. I'm not going to be concerned about how my players run them because that is beyond my control. That seems like a reasonable approach. If you want games with big dicks on the cover you'll have to make them yourself because that just doesn't appeal to me. <br/>\n<br/>\nChris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phargle" title="phargle"><img alt="phargle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phargle">phargle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233023/#Comment_233023" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-18T10:50:53+00:00" title="September 18, 2009 10:50AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hereby resolve that the next five characters I play will be gay.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233027/#Comment_233027" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-18T11:07:39+00:00" title="September 18, 2009 11:07AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2009 11:08AM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MatrixGamer</cite>What I'm wondering is whither there is much of a cost to gamemakers (in terms of lost sales) if gay characters are used?</blockquote>\nOffhand, I don't think that there are any good <i>casual</i> ways to get information on this that won't produced skewed numbers;

You read my post and decided I thought people who weren't gay couldn't really play gay characters?  What made you think that?<br/><br/><br/>As far as inclusiveness in design goes, one of my favorite inclusive bits is from IAWA.  Among the characters being developed are a young man (player A) in love with a young woman, and the leader (player <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> of the nomads with whom she is is travelling incognito.  The players are establishing their characters' best interests.  The text I'm thinking of is:<br/><br/>Player B: It's in my best interest to fall in love with the youngman.<br/>Player A: Really?<br/>Player B: Uh-huh.<br/><br/>In a few lines, the text has opened up the idea that same-sex love can have a place in the game's setting.  It even subtly acknowledges that the idea may be unusual to some, with the "Really?", while affirming it with "Uh-huh."  It's not ostentatious, but the brevity of the rules makes it hard to miss.  As far as inclusivness in rules go, I'm very happy with this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233069/#Comment_233069" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-18T14:11:31+00:00" title="September 18, 2009  2:11PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that the logic of the "You can only understand something if you are something" line leads, in it's most extreme from, to saying that only gays can role play gays.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally don't accept that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLogos 7 was moving towards that position when they said "I don't think tourist somehow understand what the people they are visiting are going threw (and these people are in the same place and time as these people for a bit at least ) I really don't see how imaginary tourism does any better."<br/>\n<br/>\nFor my own part I'll include gay characters in a low key way when it fits the story but I'm not going to go out of my way to do this. I do go out of my way to include women and Islamic characters because 1. Women play Matrix Games and 2. I'm a Muslim trying to put forwar positive images of Muslims in the media.

Then this little tiny data point popped into my head: <br/><br/>The inclusiveness of early Tribe 8 setting material (in which several major NPCs were involved in ongoing same sex relationships) was one of the things that attracted me to the setting. <br/><br/>Its also one of the things which, in retrospect, I probably could have done more with in the material I wrote for the game. I don't think I did badly, mind, but I also don't think I always brought the different sexual dynamics that were going on between characters in my head out onto the page as well as I should have. <br/><br/>In my adventure Church and State a lesbian marriage is one of the things that sets off a series of bad events. In retrospect I'm more than a little ambivalent about it. On one hand, I tried pretty hard to make the characters getting married the ones you'd sympathize with, and to point out pretty clearly that what happened after was not their fault, but the fault of the bad reactions and prejudices of others. And I didn't women in a refrigerator either of them. But neither did they take center stage, nor was the issue strongly put forward in the scenario. And on the other hand, there are real ways in which someone could read it (against my intentions) as being a "gay marriage causes bad shit to happen" scenario. Feedback I've gotten from folks who have played seems to indicate that doesn't happen a lot in play, but I can't be sure it hasn't ever. Also, there are ways in which the scenario turned into a sausage fest and about white males reactions to a lesbian marriage, and sidelined the actual homosexual characters as full humans.<br/><br/>So, my own track record here isn't exactly a thing of perfection.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233178/#Comment_233178" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-19T07:43:32+00:00" title="September 19, 2009  7:43AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have Church and State.

Its what I think of as "the assumed hero role" -- and its a problem in RPGs specifically, but also can be a problem it other mediums. <br/><br/>I think one of the clearest examples I can think of to demonstrate is the show Supernatural. I like the show, but there are parts of it I don't like, and its easy to say why. The show is about two skinny heterosexual white boy heroes who go about middle America and solve everyone's problems for them. Now, there's nothing wrong with this really, but as the show goes on its lead to this dynamic: Every week we get someone who needs to be saved or someone who is going to die in order to increase the melodrama/pressure upon the PC... er... heroes. Again, this isn't really a problem. Except that it leads to a place where the most effective folks to put in danger are those who fit into victim roles. So we get lots of dead women who weren't able to do shit to protect themselves because the boys failed them. Lots of strong black characters who get killed off to show how bad ass the monster is so we'll be properly impressed when the heroes face it. And so on it goes. <br/><br/>Now, I'm not saying here that Supernatural is a terrible show. In fact, in some ways you can see the folks who make it really trying and it is a show that, as I said, I watch and enjoy. They do have strong female character, strong black characters, and so on. (Though, germaine to this thread, I don't off hand remember any strong openly homosexual characters.) But in the end its the kind of heroic story where the Heroes (capital H) must be the ones that solve the problem. Its okay to occasionally have a minor character save them from a tight spot, or have the scene where the minor character unexpectedly is able to save themselves... but in the end the problems of the show will be solved or not solved by the Heroes, and so everyone else around them will always be less of a character because they exist, at a structural level, only to act as goads, foils, support, or consequence for the choices of the Heroes. <br/><br/>And since our heroes are skinny straight white boys, that means that in this particular show, despite the many members of other groups present, its really only the actions of the skinny straight white boys that matter over the long term. <br/><br/>A lot, lot, lot of RPG play falls into that mode. Its the PC Heroes who must do the important things and make the important choices. To do elsewise is to verge into all sorts of sins: railroading, marysueism, deprotagonization, etc. So who the PCs are becomes a real issue. If the PCs are all straight white boys, then in the end, its going to be the decisions of the straight white boys that matter. <br/><br/>Which is something that's often, in most traditional models of scenario building, somewhat out of our hands. Church and State didn't have pregen PCs, because it was assumed to be part of an ongoing game, for example. Of course, one obvious answer to this is to include pregen PCs, and to have those PCs not fit into the straight box. A lesbian hero in Church and State would be awesome. Maybe I should have included one? <br/><br/>OTOH, there are also ways in which that might be me not trusting the players to do their own thing or have their own stake. I do know from an email AP report that at least one group that played Church and State did have a lesbian hero PC (who was also religious, thus making the whole adventure a kick in the face for her). At that point, because she and not the straight guys, were the Hero, the whole nature of the beast changed. (It also, notably, took a whole section of the adventure out of the book because the PC did things that weren't on the adventure path.) <br/><br/>So, sometimes you can trust players to do their own thing. But I also think that we still need to look for ways, subtle and at the structural and social level, to help break the mold where the assumed hero for so much of RP is a straight white guy. (Or a straight white guy who happens to have pointy ears and bright purple skin.)<br/><br/>Edit: As a brief example, because I was just reading the book, In Empire of Dust one of the Unique Trait based subplots has to do with an "angel" lover of God who has abandoned God for a mortal lover. The book is very careful to never assume the gender of this mortal lover. It never says "he" it never says "the man she loves" it always says "her mortal lover" or some variation of it. And while that doesn't necessarily encourage a homosexual relationship, it also doesn't put a mark against it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peccable" title="peccable"><img alt="peccable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peccable">peccable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233228/#Comment_233228" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-19T19:58:14+00:00" title="September 19, 2009  7:58PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MatrixGamer</cite>1.

If you aren't Muslim you can't really play a Muslim character because no matter how empathetic or knowledgable you are you're just a tourist.<br/><br/>So what is the incentive for me as a designer to include Muslim characters?<br/><br/>(or, for that matter, as a player to play Muslim characters?)<br/><br/>I have to say, I really don't buy the "tourist" idea. That combined with your post about "I really do get about the repression piece": "Oh and I didn\u2019t mention the addictions mental illnesses, and suicides. Moan." feels too much like who's-the-bigger-victim, which wasn't my point at all.<br/><br/>Let me try to give a parallel example.<br/><br/>There was a thread here a while ago that set off some buttons in me.  I never ended up posting, but I did some personal examination over it.  I can't remember the original topic, but basically at one point one of the posters basically said to another: "You're a white guy in the US. You're speaking of a position of privilege and you just don't get it."<br/><br/>That statement really hit me hard.  My knee-jerk reaction was -- "But...I'm a gay guy!  I've had all kinds of crap thrown at me for it!  I understand!"<br/><br/>But I didn't -- not really.  YES -- I can empathise and connect the issues that someone black, or female might experience.  I can see similarities.  But I'm not going to get certain things on a very fundamental level because I'm NOT black and I'm NOT female.  Yes, I've had privilege.  And it's taken me a while to sit with that, understand it, and accept it.  I'm still not fully sure I get it.<br/><br/>But you know what?  That doesn't give me an excuse NOT to keep trying and understanding people who are different than me.  It doesn't give me an excuse not to flex my empathic muscles and try understanding the parts that I can understand (and those will be, honestly, those parts that echo in myself), while sitting with the fact that I'll never truly understand.<br/><br/>The tourist thing just really feels like a cop-out.  YES, there are people who treat 'The Other' in this way, but that's honestly not what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>Back to the Gay-&gt;Muslim swap above.<br/><br/>I've never played a Muslim character, in all honesty, and now I'm really curious to, because I can think of a TON of things that it might effect, without being the obvious stereotypes that you're talking about. A character who was raised within the Muslim faith will have that fact color everything about (say) him. It's not the ONLY thing that defines him, certainly, I don't think you can seriously say that there's nothing different about the character now that we've established this fact.<br/><br/>I don't have to go for the obvious storylines, either.  I'm sure there's stereotypical ones on both sides.  You don't have to tell the coming-out story if you're gay, and I don't have to play the struggling with my faith one if I'm Muslim (or Christian or Jewish or...). Or the 'outsider' for both -- being the only one of your kind in a group, etc.<br/><br/>Not to say those stories are bad, or boring. But I don't have to go for the obvious.<br/><br/>I suppose you could argue that if I'm not making his religion or sexuality the center of his story, then what's the point?  But I think it WILL effect the character and how I play him. Just knowing that fact will have subtle and profound implications on how he plays out.  Every issue that character faces will be different because of what I know about him.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MatrixGamer</cite>hopefully it is relevant to the game. If not and if it\u2019s bugging other players then we have a social contract issue.</blockquote>\nThis threw me, I have to say.  If just saying "my character is gay" is going to throw all kinds of social contract issues in a group, then I don't think it's a group I want to play with. This really pings my "why do you have to make such a deal of it/why can't you just stay in the closet" button. How would you feel if someone said "Does your character *have* to be Muslim? Is that pertient to his storyline at all? Aren't you just being gratuitous? Can we just drop it?"<br/><br/>The example you gave re:sexuality in gaming was horrific and absolutely a social contract issue. If you were in a public game with children, it's really quite alright to say, "that's really not how we're playing, either drop that from the game or please leave."  There's the whole idea of lines and veils and he quite clearly stepped over a line. I don't know if I'd feel comfortable tackling that particular issue even with a group I was comfortable playing with.<br/><br/>But to compare having a gay character in a game to that feels rather like a straw-man. I don't think the two are comparable at all.<br/><br/>And I feel like I have to say that all of the above has less with "educating" or "experiencing" or "learning and growing as a person" than just good story. I just think the more nuanced a character, the more interesting things I can say about them up front and in play, the better.<br/><br/>-d-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233298/#Comment_233298" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-20T12:51:44+00:00" title="September 20, 2009 12:51PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 20, 2009 12:52PM by Robert_Bohl.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there's an interesting thing here about what kinds of person you <i>aren't</i> that you feel motivated to play.

And a couple of people shying away from it.</p>\n<p>We play people different from ourselves because that's the closest we can get to walking in someone else's moccasins. You <em>can't</em> actually do it. All you can do is imagine it. No amount of experience will give you the same experience as someone else. Keep in mind, moccasins are something you take off and put on. The implication is that you think someone's whining about walking, but when you put on their moccasins, you realize there's a lump in the heel, and now you understand where they were coming from. It doesn't mean you have the same feet. And it certainly doesn't mean you don't have the option to switch back to your own moccasins when you're tired of that guy's crappy footwear.</p>\n<p>When you "put on" a homosexual character as a straight player, you have opportunities to cock it up <em>with minimal repurcussions</em>, and try a different character later (or the same character played differently, or whatever). In the process, you'll learn stuff about yourself and your friends. Next time you can do better, no matter how well you did this time. No one, least of all the gay players in this thread, are saying, "Don't make your characters gay or you'll screw it up and I'll be offended." What I'm saying (and paraphrasing, I think, from this thread) is, don't treat homosexuality like an aberration. It's a think that motivates people just like anything else.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233435/#Comment_233435" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-21T09:35:09+00:00" title="September 21, 2009  9:35AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

Struggling to understand what in the end you can't understand fully and the need for game designers to nudge players to that exploration by including characters who are gay. <br/><br/>We don't do it. (Except when we do - which I've done in the past - when it helped the story I was presenting). We can do more of it. <br/><br/>So I throw out the challenge to you to do it. If you feel resistance to doing so then share why here. That would get at the rub of why gay characters are not more often included. Is it fear? Embarrasment? A desire to not do it wrong? A desire to not offend potential conservative customers? Other reasons? <br/><br/>I've already resolved to include more gay characters.

This has the effect of gay and bi realtionships being quite common (it's a scifi game, so I dig that effect). Sometimes you even end up with relationship webs that are impossible unless at least one person is gay or bi.<br/><br/>It's a curious effect, but it's quite reliable. This order (along with prewritten relationships to choose from that include a lot of love and sex) produces gay and bi relationships.
