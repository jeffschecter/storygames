OOC text and planning for the game was done in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23playnow&amp;Mode=like">#playnow</a>, and the game actually took part in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23playingnow&amp;Mode=like">#playingnow</a>.  There's two seperate logs, later on we'll find a way to merge the log files so it's less disjointed.  But, it was great fun and the entire session's present.  Need to split it across multiple posts to get the full thing up however.<br/>\n<br/>\nPool IRC test:  The Unreadable Mechanical Mind\n<hr class="bbcode_rule"/>\n<br/>\nSetting: 100 years Future<br/>\nRobots, Telepathy and Psionics<br/>\n<br/>\nIssues: Totalitarianism, Racial troubles (with robots, who do not have telepathy).<br/>\n<br/>\nRufus Henderson: A mild-mannered Robotics Technician, Second Grade with a deep revolutionary conviction, Rufus works in one of the poorest areas of the city. This allows him to perform his work without much supervision from the Wardens: 'unlocking' the robots' Authority Circuits, and granting them conscious independance whether they want it or not.<br/>\nTraits: Deep Revolutionary Conviction +2, 'Off The Radar' +1, Robot Friends/Enemies Everywhere +2, Robotics Technician, Second Grade +0<br/>\n<br/>\nTeplin's Character<br/>\nName: Nick Swot<br/>\nOccupation: Scientist/Engineer<br/>\nSummary:  Nick is one of the engineers working on the latest generation of robots.  His hope is to find a way to transfer the consciousness of his dead, cryogenically stored wife into a robot body.  He works on this project secretly, after hours.  He would do anything to talk to her again.<br/>\nTraits: Robot Engineer +1, Obsessed with bringing his wife back +2, Is a jogger +0<br/>\n<br/>\nAlette's Character<br/>\nName: Stephanie Grey<br/>\nOccupation: Scientist/Engineer<br/>\nSummary:  Stephanie is one of the lead engineers in designing the latest generation of robots.  Despite working for the government she's given lots of leeway.  She is subject to mental exams and checks, but, instead of directly affecting the government regime, she's responsible for the exploits that allow the robots to be unlocked by others.<br/>\nTraits:  Robotic Engineer +2, Maze of Thoughts +1<br/>\n<br/>\nWe started with discussion in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23playnow&amp;Mode=like">#playnow</a> about the type of game we were gonna play, came up with a future kind of I, Robot type setting with a government that keeps tight wraps on it's people and property.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game started with Rufus unlocking a robot's sentience, and it followed programming to return to the nearest lab for diagnostics, it turns out that it was one of Nick's experiments that may have succeeded finally, however a monitor robot called a warden was tracking Rufus and Rufus had followed it to the lab.  Rufus attacked the Warden and Stephanie half caught on to some sort of thing must be going on and intentionally sacrificed herself to let Nick and Rufus escape.

Let it be known. The Pool was a good choice for IRC play, though I look forward to figuring out how to track more complex mechanics online. I remember people used to play Capes in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23indierpgs&amp;Mode=like">#indierpgs</a>, so I know it must be possible.<br><br>(And apparently I got 'Off The Grid' and 'Under The Radar' confused when I was writing Rufus' traits. )<br><br>Also of interest -- when we were rambling around regarding the setting (having mostly decided 'in the future' and 'earthbound') I suggested we apply the Shock: grid in order to nail down a more coherent/focused setting. It wasn't a big thing, but it definitely helped focus the brainstorming into a more coherent setting.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227800/#Comment_227800" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-26T05:53:22+00:00" title="August 26, 2009  5:53AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome!
