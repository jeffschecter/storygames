Being a highbrow I do not play them. But I love watching people play who have a passion for games." - Virginia Woolf, <a href="http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/w/woolf/virginia/w91d/chap23.html" rel="nofollow">unsent letter to the editor on the subject of middlebrows</a><br/><br/>I'm using terms that are sort of insulting- so let me say up front that I'm offender <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> in terms of designing games that are middlebrow in the sense of aiming to be about aspects of 'modernism' and that kind of stuff but either failing to hit the mark or addressing it mainly through some mild pretension in the topic choice. <br/><br/>So my sense is that there are no highbrow rpgs, indie or otherwise, nothing that can be considered as having intellectual depth or being insightful about the human condition. There are probably shining bits and pieces here and there from published games, I may have missed a game or two from some contest that could qualify, and something may be in development that will totally change my mind. Still, the basic point stands. This is surprising. I don't think there are any mismatches between games &amp; high culture, in fact games exist on the fringes of literature and theatre and some sciences and tons of folks who design and play games and theorize are clearly bright and cultured and intentional about their fun.<br/><br/>There are lots of lowbrow rpgs, presumably because gary gygax liked pulpish genre fiction. (Although not all horror or fantasy or anime or whatever is automatically lowbrow). Lowbrow games might be characterized as games that don't make you think about anything that matters. <br/><br/>Middlebrow games are the most tricky. You seem to be thinking when you're playing, and the structure or subject matter may appear to be experimental or deep. But suffering and conflict is external, usually in the form of threats to a characters' (or player's) goals. It's gamed out through conflict resolution and often reinforced by a forge narrativist style focus on what your character cares about- which becomes a threat magnet. Or it skirts the real question and you just create some cool surface. Either way, this can be engaging, but you're not challenged, our assumptions and inauthenticity not questioned.<br/><br/>my questions to throw out there are: <br/><br/>could a high culture/ deep game be created and would it be fun?<br/>is it unfair to say that one kind of supposedly serious or provocative thinking matters and the rest (strategizing, enjoying content etc) are lowbrow? (I enjoy strategy, advancing missions,  and exploring content/setting by the way)<br/>does middlebrow make sense applied to rpgs and is it really a trap?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Hastings" title="Jon Hastings"><img alt="Jon Hastings" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Hastings">Jon Hastings</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78672/#Comment_78672" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-29T04:30:49+00:00" title="June 29, 2007  4:30AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: markv</cite>could a high culture/ deep game be created and would it be fun?</blockquote>\nI think: sure it could be.  As for the fun? Well, I'm not sure I'd use that word, but certainly I can imagine a game like that being engaging/interesting/satisfying/pleasurable.  I mean, I didn't have much fun watching <i>13 Lakes</i>, but as an "highbrow" experience it was certainly satisfying.\n<blockquote>is it unfair to say that one kind of supposedly serious or provocative thinking matters and the rest (strategizing, enjoying content etc) are lowbrow? (I enjoy strategy, advancing missions,  and exploring content/setting by the way)</blockquote>\nWell, yeah, IMO, at least, this is unfair.  I mean, you <i>can</i> say whatever you want about it, but, like, saying that Milton Babbit (serious composition!!!) matters more than Count Basie (entertaining improvisation!!!) (just for instance) will probably raise a few eyebrows.\n<blockquote>does middlebrow make sense applied to rpgs and is it really a trap?</blockquote>\nI think it does make sense but it's no more of a trap in the way it's used in any other context.  Personally, I like middlebrow stuff and like to use the term descriptively rather than as a value-judgment.  I mean, lots of great folk/pop-derived 20th C art is pretty middlebrow - i.e., Bob Dylan, Duke Ellington, <i>Citizen Kane</i>, Jack Kirby's Fourth World comics, <i>Peanuts</i>, <i>The Sopranos</i>, Ross MacDonald's Lew Archer novels, etc., etc.  I'm not sure that any game should be ashamed to aspire to join a list like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78675/#Comment_78675" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-29T05:02:03+00:00" title="June 29, 2007  5:02AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Uh ... could I get some definitions of these terms?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not trying to be snarky, or sophist..ic ...

It's funny, because I think people would consider most of my passive entertainment choices as Highbrow. When it comes to RPGs, though, I just think Lowbrow is the most fun. Even though I've had fun playing all of the WoD stuff (firmly in the Middlebrow category), there's just something *more* fun about "going out and adventuring." You know... saving the kingdom, robbing from the rich to give to the poor, putting the bad guy behind bars with the depth of my motivation being only that I'm a Good Guy Hero Type... it's just *fun*.<br><br>Also, I do think there are a few games which could be considered Highbrow for purposes of this topic. Shock: Social Science Fiction comes to mind first. Universalis is Highbrow, even if the plots a group makes with it are Lowbrow. I also think that the ideas behind DitV are, but easily missed as such, because the setting is not. It would be easy to classify it into Middlebrow, but I think if you really inspect it, you would find it Highbrow.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78717/#Comment_78717" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-29T09:23:31+00:00" title="June 29, 2007  9:23AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: vertigo25</cite>I'm totally okay with the terms (especially because of their antiquity), and think I understand where the OP is coming from.</blockquote>Great!

He is the man or woman of thoroughbred intelligence who rides his mind at a gallop across country in pursuit of an idea. That is why I have always been so proud to be called highbrow. That is why, if I could be more of a highbrow I would. I honour and respect highbrows. Some of my relations have been highbrows; and some, but by no means all, of my friends. To be a highbrow, a complete and representative highbrow, a highbrow like Shakespeare, Dickens, Byron, Shelley, Keats, Charlotte Bronte, Scott, Jane Austen, Flaubert, Hardy or Henry James\xe2\u20ac\u201dto name a few highbrows from the same profession chosen at random\xe2\u20ac\u201dis of course beyond the wildest dreams of my imagination. And, though I would cheerfully lay myself down in the dust and kiss the print of their feet, no person of sense will deny that this passionate preoccupation of theirs\xe2\u20ac\u201driding across country in pursuit of ideas\xe2\u20ac\u201doften leads to disaster. Undoubtedly, they come fearful croppers. Take Shelley\xe2\u20ac\u201dwhat a mess he made of his life! And Byron, getting into bed with first one woman and then with another and dying in the mud at Missolonghi.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Virginia Woolf</cite>highbrows, for some reason or another, are wholly incapable of dealing successfully with what is called real life. That is why, and here I come to a point that is often surprisingly ignored, they honour so wholeheartedly and depend so completely upon those who are called lowbrows. By a lowbrow is meant of course a man or a woman of thoroughbred vitality who rides his body in pursuit of a living at a gallop across life. That is why I honour and respect lowbrows\xe2\u20ac\u201dand I have never known a highbrow who did not. In so far as I am a highbrow (and my imperfections in that line are well known to me) I love lowbrows; I study them; I always sit next the conductor in an omnibus and try to get him to tell me what it is like\xe2\u20ac\u201dbeing a conductor. In whatever company I am I always try to know what it is like\xe2\u20ac\u201dbeing a conductor, being a woman with ten children and thirty\xe2\u20ac\u201cfive shillings a week, being a stockbroker, being an admiral, being a bank clerk, being a dressmaker, being a duchess, being a miner, being a cook, being a prostitute. All that lowbrows do is of surpassing interest and wonder to me, because, in so far as I am a highbrow, I cannot do things myself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Virginia Woolf</cite>But what, you may ask, is a middlebrow? And that, to tell the truth, is no easy question to answer. They are neither one thing nor the other. They are not highbrows, whose brows are high; nor lowbrows, whose brows are low. Their brows are betwixt and between. They do not live in Bloomsbury which is on high ground; nor in Chelsea, which is on low ground. Since they must live somewhere presumably, they live perhaps in South Kensington, which is betwixt and between. The middlebrow is the man, or woman, of middlebred intelligence who ambles and saunters now on this side of the hedge, now on that, in pursuit of no single object, neither art itself nor life itself, but both mixed indistinguishably, and rather nastily, with money, fame, power, or prestige. The middlebrow curries favour with both sides equally. He goes to the lowbrows and tells them that while he is not quite one of them, he is almost their friend.

I think the problem lies in how the terms carry such derogatory implications to a lot of people. Really, Woolf helped reinforce those feelings. She helped popularize the notion of elitism, and that intellectuals were of a higher class than non-intellectuals.<br><br>I think markv was talking about the ideals applied to the terms rather than the class structure.<br/><br/>The basic gist I got from the OP is that Highbrow has intellectual depth. The process of thinking is important, but also *what* is thought about. Like traditional highbrow ideals, value is given to the humanities because they have a long-term impact on society. Art, politics, philosophy, and ethics would be things considered "important." But just thinking about them is not enough. To a highbrow, one must also "appreciate" them. This is not just "liking" them or being interested in them; it's a formal process of analyzing them under certain criteria.<br/><br/>Lowbrow has no explicit depth (by these definitions) and is not concerned with it. There's no value in intellectualism (or "appreciation") because they don't impact the here and now.<br/><br/>Middlebrow is kind of like an illusion of depth. You're thinking, but it's not about the things the highbrow consider important (which is actually very different than my understanding of the original term... this is just what I get from the post).<br/><br/>My take on what the OP was asking was: are games themselves automatically excluded from being highbrow like Woolf implies. Can games give more than the illusion of depth. Can they actually be not just *about* thinking about "important" things but can they actually cause you to do so? Can the play of a game itself be Highbrow? If they can be, would it be "fun?"<br/><br/>To me, the terms are only insulting when they become attached to social classes (granted, they almost always are). Elitism is bogus. The notion that people who don't subscribe to highbrow ideals can not be intelligent, or that they do not matter is obviously a horrible idea. The people who were concerned with these notions lived in a very different time, though. I think it's important to keep that in mind.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vertigo25" title="vertigo25"><img alt="vertigo25" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://vertigo25.com/junk/supesavatar-tiny.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vertigo25">vertigo25</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78745/#Comment_78745" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-29T10:44:34+00:00" title="June 29, 2007 10:44AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Doh!<br/><br/>That's what I get for walking away from my damn computer in the middle of a post!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78748/#Comment_78748" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-29T10:55:20+00:00" title="June 29, 2007 10:55AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is totally a good topic in here somewhere, though I reckon some eyes will be blackened before we find it.<br/><br/>This is a topic I'm grappling with right now.

Perhaps most puissantly, we had one game of <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em> where the central tension was the PCs, representatives of the British Empire, showed up at an asteroid colony set up along utopian ideals against the wishes of the Empire... and said colony was literally built on top of a giant asset (a functioning high martian spaceship), was being attacked by another solar power, and included the daughter of a Member of Parliament, who wanted her returned to England despite her own wishes.  The game used troupe play, so we had an 'upstairs' set of PCs and a 'downstairs' set, and at the start of the game we had an entire scene where the downstairs PCs discussed various flavors of utopianism and marxism.<br/><br/>BUT there was also steam-powered spaceships and etheric snap cannons and ancient martian spaceship-asteroids.  I can easily see the likes of Virginia Woolf turning up her nose at the game at all the 'lowbrow' trappings it involved.  Now, it involved all of those trappings for specific reasons, and they all had thematic import and all, but we also just had fun shooting laser beams and shit, too.  So I don't want to imply that it was high-falutin' smarty-talk the whole time.<br/><br/>Me personally, I like the juxtaposition of the sacred and the profane.  I like highbrow concepts expressed through lowbrow content (and lowbrow concepts expressed through highbrow content -- see academic-focused games of <em>Roach</em>).  I have a crippling addiction to irony, and this stuff just amuses the hell out of me.  I am also of the opinion that the juxtaposition reveals aspects of both sides that aren't otherwise easily accessible.  Marxism, to take one specific example, is meaningless without the visceral experience of the downtrodden.  The more ways you cross concepts that are normally kept separate, the more you learn about both concepts.  Or at least, that's my take on it.<br/><br/>How this fits into Woolf's high/middle/low thing?  Well, she's a modernist and likes her distinctions; I'm quite a fan of post-modernism, which tends to use distinctions as toys whose sole purpose is shredding each other into pieces in frenzies of internal contradictions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vertigo25" title="vertigo25"><img alt="vertigo25" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://vertigo25.com/junk/supesavatar-tiny.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vertigo25">vertigo25</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78757/#Comment_78757" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-29T11:14:29+00:00" title="June 29, 2007 11:14AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>The whole taxonomy is a crock of warmed-over Modernism.

By this logic, a game would be Highbrow by virtue of being a favored pastime of a person known to be Highbrow, excepting of course a game played by a Highbrow person who was consciously lowering their status to accommodate another person in the spirit of nobilis oblige.<br/><br/>But let's say we reject that. Any person is capable of being high-, middle- and lowbrow over the course of their lives, depending on their current position on (say) some sort of cerebral/visceral scale. A thing is ordained with its -brow level based on how an audience member receives it. The -brow it is given will depend in part on the content of the thing itself (what is "sold"), but also on what our audience member's receptiveness to the assorted -brow levels is (what is "bought").<br/><br/>Now, consider all the different experiences that could come out of an RPG and given a -brow. There is the rule set itself. There is a particular gaming session in which the audience member is participating. There is a particular gaming session in which an audience member is only observing (say, at a con). There is the streamlined Actual Play report. There is the Actual Play podcast. Each of these could potentially inspire different -brows depending on specifics.<br/><br/>The question then becomes not, can a game be _____-brow, but how can the designer/GM/player control (or at least recognize) the -brow level of the game to maximize desired response (be it enjoyment, catharsis, cash money or what have you).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78791/#Comment_78791" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-29T13:54:02+00:00" title="June 29, 2007  1:54PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe it's like <i>octaNe</i>, which you can play in several different modes.

I very much have to agree with what he says there at the end. The fluidity of RPGs makes them approachable in all three styles. That's what I meant by "the play" being the important part. Certain ways of playing the game are going to be "highbrow." Even a D&amp;D dungeon crawl, I say, could be played highbrow.</p>\n<p>I think the defining difference for me is what the players are attempting to do rather than what the characters are attempting to do. The characters and the plot could be about intellectual issues, but it doesn't necessarily mean the players will be using intellectual modes of thought while playing. They may simply be rolling dice and trying to figure out how to get to the next scene.</p>\n<p>If they're playing by using some of those intellectual modes, well, then, it's "highbrow." In my mind, creating stories that take in to consideration plot, scene structure, voice, and literary structure; all with an appreciation for the endeavor, then you're practicing an intellectual game. Appreciation of literature is, after all, one of the highbrow ideals, as is creating it.</p>\n<p>Even Nomic, which I think is easily one of the "brainiest" games ever, is not intrinsically intellectual, but it definitely lends itself to intellectual modes. Reading the "rules," and without even playing seeing the amazing and artful structure of them... <em>that's</em> intellectual.</p>\n<p>So can a designer/GM/player control the _brow level?

From the focus on the psychology of soldiers and the source material I'll trust you that it's insightful about the stresses of being a soldier and deserving of being described as highbrow under my admittedly problematic definition.  I have played polaris, which is some ways seems like it would be the anti-carry. I can see intellectual depth in the design, and our play experience was loopy and quite fun. The somewhat precious style, constellation of threats circling the doomed heroes makes it a middle brow game under my admittedly problematic definition. I guess if one was in the right frame of mind it might play like a romantic poem. By the way I liked Polaris enough that it partly inspired the system for my game <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/Satanic_Mills.php" rel="nofollow">satanic mills</a>, which itself is a flawed attempt at high-browish subject matter. <br/><br/>Most comments on this thread doubt the usefulness of applying these brow terms to rpgs and it's not going to be a distinction that I'll be using much either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78894/#Comment_78894" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-30T08:05:40+00:00" title="June 30, 2007  8:05AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think <a href="http://www.costik.com/brecht.html" rel="nofollow">Bestial Acts</a> might qualify as high-brow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78934/#Comment_78934" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-30T16:47:46+00:00" title="June 30, 2007  4:47PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually don't mind the use of the terms.

They share memories. Each scene is the funeral of one of the other characters - the final scene is a common memory of their best moment together. Beautiful, poignant, and an experience that stuck for days.<br/><br/>Faderen (The Father) by Erlend Bruer is about patricide. The setting is up to the participants. Three characters: The Mother, the Son, the Daughter, one of which, chosen at random, will kill the father - who is not played by anyone. Scenes are inspired by cards with single words or short paragraphs. The game structure leads slowly towards the murder of the father in the final scene.<br/><br/>What the games have in common is that they rely heavily on player expectations and personal experience as a base for improvisation.

No. I only came across it recently, when I bought a copy of Second Life.<br/><br/>My take is that it's not really meant to be played. It's more Greg's response to the complaint that RPGs are always based on "genre" fiction. Rather than pointing out that RPGs can build on those genre conventions in interesting ways, Bestial Acts is more a demonstration that perhaps the themes of "serious" fiction aren't going to produce a gaming experience that many people find appealing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
