I may like dealing with the Mudmen in the game, but if my GM doesn't know that, then we'll have a single encounter with the Mudmen and move on.  If I can convey that information to the GM somehow, then he can reintroduce them later and we'll maximize our fun.<br/><br/>Flags are one of many ways of identifying people's preferences.  I could take a trait in the game that is, say "Favored Enemy: Mudmen" or "Always confused by Mudmen speech patterns" or something.  That's a signal to other people that the Mudmen are important to me and my character somehow.  Then they know I'd like to see the Mudmen come back later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190802/#Comment_190802" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-01T19:18:10+00:00" title="February  1, 2009  7:18PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, but ignoring all that interpets and oracles stuff, <br/><br/>I'm flat out asking what my players want and do not want. <br/><br/>So I'm just dealing with preferences then, and not flags at all?<br/><br/>Thanks                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190804/#Comment_190804" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-01T20:05:49+00:00" title="February  1, 2009  8:05PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah.

Sockets being that thing which brings about my jollies are preferences that I enjoy? <br/><br/>amidoinitriteguys?<br/><br/><br/>I like the word a bit moar than perhaps preferences because it gives the impression that its something to be fufilled or pluged in, I also like it because it makes me think of neuron's receptors floating arround in the vast chemical soup , waiting for the appropiate chemical to attach to them, which is visually fun, and perhaps gives a good idea of the layered/complex/not creative agenda way of concieving play. <br/><br/>But other than that, I'm left with a rather big, so what. <br/><br/>As for 4e and the quests but, I feel you are correct, but how would you suggest we go about it. Making your own quests, especially in the sense that  you do it whenever it catches your fancy feels trivial, but you dont want to punish failure (as that in general only seems to work when the participants have no choice but to continue ) but do you really want a bunch of half assed and uncompleted quests denoting your story in the game so far?<br/><br/>Oddly enough, some of my PC's are already doing this, denoting ancient eladrin cities that have been taken over by demonspawn and that he would really like to go back and cleanse with a holy fire. (Which is kewl, this is great, I'm affraid of the quest, to go to the bar and get really hammered, and the quest to go to the whore house and not catch a std, and the quest to catch the warlock on the loo, and tip the outhouse on him, which im not sure is a good fear or a bad fear )<br/><br/>So to take another example, most of the group, Don't want to involve drow in any form. Now this isn't a flag because they told me outright rather than me interpreting it threw flags from some other source, and this isn't a socket because its a negative preference. Its not about enjoyment its about not enjoying drow, is it an anti socket, or is there some other fancy term for it. <br/><br/>Thanks for your help everyone, <br/><br/>Logos<br/><br/>&gt;And if people want to go on moar about the 4th edtiion quest system, that would be awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190869/#Comment_190869" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-02T11:47:28+00:00" title="February  2, 2009 11:47AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Logos,<br/><br/>You are correct sockets are not flags.

Frex, Morningstar says "I don't give it an opportunity anyway, but I don't want to see any sexual violence in my games, period". I say "I don't want to see any gross violence towards animals". Dumb, but it's my issue.<br/><br/>Anyway, the difference between lines and veils is that with veils, you're saying "I don't care if this is addressed in the game or not, I just don't want to see it". Frex, you could say that "NPC X was raped" (frex, if you're playing a modern gritty cop show-themed RPG ala Law and Order), but you don't ACTUALLY SEE IT at the table (that is, the fact that NPC X was raped/gets raped is there, but you don't actually play it out, see it happen).<br/>With Lines, you just say "I don't want to see it or hear about it or have it implied". So if you said that Rape was "over your line", that means that there's no implied rape, no one gets raped, no one talks about it, etc.<br/><br/>It's just good form, otherwise people might get uncomfortable or even squicked out if you trip up someone's issue without realizing it.<br/><br/>For me, I pretty much dwell in "adventure gameing land", so it's rarely an issue. Although recently we're doing a lot of modern gritty horror games: But in my groups, we've got a "if you have anything squicky that would make that scenario better, just leave it behind the veil. No reason to see it. And speak up anytime if you have a problem with anything" (frex, one of the players in my group says "no violence toards children, period"... which is fine, because none of us would have had real or implied violence towards kids ANYWAY... but still, it's a good reminder out there, that people have issues, so that we take care when presenting other things).<br/><br/>Hope that clears it up a little.<br/><br/>-Andy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190929/#Comment_190929" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-02T18:06:02+00:00" title="February  2, 2009  6:06PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Logos, as succintly as possible, I think:<br/><br/>Flags are mechanics, components of games-as-played, that facilitate communication between players (often GM and PC players).<br/>Sockets are preferences of players, what they like and what they 'plug in' to.<br/><br/>Flags can communicate sockets, but often provide more fine-tuned information: I may have a "character socket" while my flag is "Mysterious missing father."  I want my missing father to be relevant in the game, presumably because that will allow for the characterization that I enjoy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190952/#Comment_190952" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-02T21:54:23+00:00" title="February  2, 2009  9:54PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So are you looking for theory or techniques?  Theory is broadly useful, but requires you take time to learn it, and you have to think about how to use it.  Techniques are simpler steps you can use right away.<br/><br/>If you already know you guys are playing 4E, go with the Quest suggestions above.  <br/><br/>If you don't know what your players are into, it might just be as easy to run a few one shots of different games and pay close attention to which players get excited over what.<br/><br/>Otherwise, even with a fair amount of handholding, theory takes awhile to map to your experiences of play in order to be useful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
