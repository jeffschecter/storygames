Have at it with pointy sticks, if you will. <br/><br/>SOCIAL CONFLICT RESOLUTION <br/><br/>Step 1: Declare social action and set stakes <br/><br/>Declare your character's social action and what they hope to accomplish through it. <br/><br/><i>Extended example: "I tell the Nightmare Prince I love him to redeem him!" The magical girl Faye, the Nightmare Rouser, will attempt to redeem Alexander the Nightmare Prince (stakes) by declaring her undying love for her (action). </i><br/><br/>Step 2: Determine if a conflict occurs <br/><br/>The targeted character may allow the stakes, in which case there is no conflict and they "say yes," or resist, in which case they "roll dice." <br/><br/><i>Extended example: Alexander is not about to be redeemed that easily: a conflict does in fact occur and Faye's player and the GM must roll to resolve.</i> <br/><br/>Step 3: Determine applicable Attributes and roll <br/><br/>Add all applicable Attributes to Soul for the acting character's roll and to Mind for the resisting character's roll. <br/><br/><i>Extended example: Faye has Appearance 3: Cute, and Seduction 2, and a Soul of 6, making a whopping 11. But Alex's mind of 7 and Composture (new skill, used to resist all social action) 5 means that he adds 12 to his roll. </i><br/><br/><i>Faye rolls a 10 for a total of 21. Alex flubs, rolling 4. for a total of 16. Faye's MoS is 7.</i> <br/><br/>Step 4: Resisting character chooses to accept stakes or deduct energy <br/><br/>The resisting character may accept the acting characters stakes, or deduct the MOS of the roll from thier energy point total. <br/><br/>If they are unable to deduct energy points from thier pool equal to the MoS, then they must accept the stakes. <br/><br/><i>Extended example: Alexander must lose 7 energy points or be redeemed to the side of dreams. He elects to lose 7 energy points from his pool of 35 energy points (it's been a long battle and they've been throwing energy blasts) and now has 28. </i><br/><br/>Step 5: Edited needfully to say: The resisting character may counteract.  Repeat steps one through five for them, as needed. <br/><br/>Comments?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58892/#Comment_58892" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-03T16:36:07+00:00" title="March  3, 2007  4:36PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is there some narration of social interaction as part of this social combat system?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser" title="Elliott Belser"><img alt="Elliott Belser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser">Elliott Belser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58899/#Comment_58899" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-03T20:14:53+00:00" title="March  3, 2007  8:14PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes.

But what does "betray" mean?<br/><br/>Using stakes in these sort of social conflicts is interesting. It seems to me you can either:<br/><br/>1. Make them external actions ("If I win, he resigns his post at court"), which would work, but isn't as interesting.<br/>2. Make them internal actions ("If I win, he is filled with bitterness at the court"), which leads to interesting stuff, but leaves it vague as to what the character actually does.<br/>3. Make it somewhere in between ("If I win, he betrays the court"), which I personally I think could lead to clashes of player expectations: <br/><br/>"But you said you'd betray the court!"<br/>"I did! I broke all the procedures when spoke out of turn!" <br/>"That's not betraying them."<br/><br/>I bet Tony has answered all of this in a previous thread about Misery Bubblegum.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser" title="Elliott Belser"><img alt="Elliott Belser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser">Elliott Belser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58924/#Comment_58924" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-04T06:44:36+00:00" title="March  4, 2007  6:44AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 4, 2007 7:45AM by Elliott Belser.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They have to be very clear, in other words.  Well set.  With both internal and external components.<br/><br/>Which isn't a rules thing exactly.<br/><br/>How's this?<br/><br/><i>In the middle of a raging battle, it's Faye's action.  Rachel, Faye's player, says: "Nightmare Rouser Faye screams, 'Alexander, this is cruel!  This is... this is pointless!  I love you, don't you realize that?'  She knows there's some good in him and thinks that her love can bring it out and end the fighting."<br/><br/>The GM Elliott says "Cool beans.  So, 'does he admit he loves you and lay down his arms?' as stakes?"<br/><br/>Rachel says  "Close, but needs more zing."<br/><br/>"How about his turning on the Foul Nightmares and fighting alongside us?" says Casey.  Rachel grins.<br/><br/>Elliott reiterates: "The stakes would then be, 'Does he fight alongside the Nightmare Rousers out of newfound love for Faye?' -correct me if I'm wrong."<br/><br/>Rachel nods.  "Yeah, that's right."</i><br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2566&amp;page=1#Item_1" rel="nofollow">I'm continuing the discussion here.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
