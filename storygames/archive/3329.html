So, people who know more than I do: Could you point me towards games that fulfill one or more of the following criteria...<br/>\n<br/>\n* No resource management. (So no stat buying, no fiddling with currency etc).<br/>\n* Rules affecting narrative structures and flow in unconventional ways. (That is, not just "round after round" or "scene after scene" play - I'm thinking stuff like playing out scenes backwards in time; having several parallel stories; surrealistic jumps etc).<br/>\n* Clever ways of presenting information. (Cards, flowcharts, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\n[EDIT] Oh, yeah - it's completely OK to pimp your game here, as long as it fits with the above!

That said, I suspect the final version might.<br/><br/>But I will suggest A Penny For My Thoughts by Paul Tevis.  In his game, there's practically no resource management, only a <em>literal</em> fiddling of currency as you hand coins off to other players.  There's no sense of linear time in either game, but especially Paul's as you're re-enacting moments of your forgotten life.  The character sheet for Paul's game is a questionnaire you fill out during play as you remember more about your character.  There's also weak character ownership elements in the game, because the actions you take during your memories are dictated by others (though you have control over the environment and all "NPCs").<br/><br/>He's working on it right now as an ashcan for GenCon, and I know it's seen some improvement since the Game Chef edition because he's part of the game design group Mike Sugarbaker &amp; I started up, <a href="http://mastermines.wordpress.com/tag/games-in-development/a-penny-for-my-thoughts/" rel="nofollow">Master Mines</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75375/#Comment_75375" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-13T10:33:16+00:00" title="June 13, 2007 10:33AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No fiddling of currency?  Wow, you just took away every game that I was interested in.<br/><br/>There's a really good game hiding underneath the present draft of Masquerade, but you'll have to dig to find it.  The mechanics of the game aren't important (they are totally over-rode with "the GM says what happens") but some of the setting/set-up is really interesting.<br/><br/>You might like In the Beginning ... or you might not.  It's hard for me to tell.
