There's stuff like the Rising RPG triangle (yeah, we've got a triangle like everyone else), based around Performance, Enactment and Collaborative Storytelling. There are Banana Description games, there's Impro Gaming (related to the Mushin Manifest), there are the old Dogma games, the three types of Strategic Handling (Resource, Risk and Capacity), the Flow-er Model and so on and so on.</blockquote>\nSimon, and anyone else in the know, do you mind talking more about these? Or are there links to where we can delve into them?

Here it is in <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=sv&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=sv&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rollspel.nu%2Fforum%2Fubbthreads.php%2Fposts%2F626522.html&amp;act=url" rel="nofollow">Google English</a>.<br/><br/>The first one he talks about is <i>Enactment</i> (of the role), which he by the times this post was written had started calling <i>Simulationism</i> as well. The second one is <i>Perfomance</i>, or <i>Problem solving</i>, and the last one is <i>Collaborative</i> (or <i>Shared</i>) <i>Storytelling</i>.<br/><br/>These terms have some similarities to the ones in the GNS triangle but they clearly don't match when it comes to Story Now. There's been some sort of assumed relationship between Story Now and Rising's Collaborative Storytelling which has lead a some of Swedish gamers to think that Forge games largely are just pass-the-stick hippie games. If you look at the first generation of Swedish "indie games" there's some truth to this \u2013 there where quite a few games that experimentet more with narration rights etc. and had a pretty vague connection to Story Now if any. <br/><br/>I'm under the impression that this last part is kind of true for the English speaking scene as well, so maybe another layer of theory really didn't make that much difference \u2026<br/><br/><br/><b>Banana Description games</b> are games where players are obliged include set elements when they narrate the outcomes of actions. The name comes from the example "Describe how you get through the locked door using a banana." The most obvious example of this in en English game might be in Baron Munchausen where you might prompt a player to explain however they managed to climb the outside of the tower with nothing but a chicken and a shovel at hand. I'm told InSpectres and The Supercrew have elements of this as well.<br/><br/>A version that's suddenly popular right now (well, three vocal people on in the rather small Swedish rpg design community are using them) is to have failed rolls require the player to choose a consequence from a set list and describe it ("No, you don't reach your goal, and \u2026 you break something valuable / someone gets hurt / etc).<br/><br/>Any game can have an element of this, but I think the term is mostly relevant for pointing out games that focus heavily on narration for the fun of narrating cool/crazy/fun stuff.<br/><br/><br/>The Swedish <b>Dogma games</b> where the product of an RPG design challange where the form was rigid and the content was free to experiment with. A game couldn't be longer than two pages A4 with a set minimum size for text, a limitation on what randomizers you could use for your game, etc. A full set of RPG dice was never an option I think, but some years it might have been allowed to do dice pools with only one type of die. Regular playing cards where pretty popular. As far as I can remember no input or restrictions regarding theme was given.<br/><br/>Maybe half of the games where attempts of fitting a "regular" rpg onto two pages, while the other half was more experimental.  Some games actually got played, and I think a rare few led to bigger games.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I think that's all the stuff I can comment on. Hope you aren't too disappointed about what a Banana Description game is, Zac!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379424/#Comment_379424" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-23T04:44:56+00:00" title="May 23, 2012  4:44AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 23, 2012 4:45AM by JonatanK.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>\u2026 the three types of Strategic Handling (Resource, Risk and Capacity) \u2026</blockquote>\nI don't know how much discussion and theory-building this thing saw, but I remember <a href="http://translate.google.se/translate?sl=sv&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=sv&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rollspel.nu%2Fforum%2Fubbthreads.php%2Fubb%2Fshowflat%2FNumber%2F534266%2F&amp;act=url" rel="nofollow">one thread</a> where the same Johan Rising nailed them down as the three elements one could incorporate in order to get strategic decisions in one's game. The thread was as much about board games as rpgs, so I guess it's pretty gamist?<br/><br/>In short, recource handling means you have a limited supply of something and have to choose where and when to use it, and when to save it. Risk handling is choosing between a high-risk high-reward strategy and a safer path, and situations like that. Capacity handling is just like resource handling except that the resource is automatically replenished after each round, so that whatever you don't use is lost.<br/><br/>A funny note about the gtranslated link: the "Order of the Phoenix Review" is a mistranslation. There's a swedish gaming magazine called Fenix (Swedish for Phoenix), though I admit that it would have been cool if it were called "Order of the Phoenix".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379454/#Comment_379454" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-23T07:24:47+00:00" title="May 23, 2012  7:24AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Anders! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/>Sure, "Banana Description" isn't as wacky as I thought it might be, but it's a pretty neat idea - like a role playing challenge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379660/#Comment_379660" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-24T11:27:14+00:00" title="May 24, 2012 11:27AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, thank you, Anders (DeBracy).<br/><br/>I hope you don't mind some comments later after I've had a chance to absorb this stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379720/#Comment_379720" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-25T01:04:37+00:00" title="May 25, 2012  1:04AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            God damnit I need to hang around on Story Games more.

It's based around the challenge of coming up with a plausible and interesting way to combine seemingly disparate elements. When playing these types of games, a good description is a sure sign of skill, which is why I classify it as SOU in Forge theory terms. The genre has a few games in it (as mentioned, InSpectres and Muchausen have elements of this in them) and some interesting things are happening right now in our community. The game "Superg\xe4nget" (translated into English as "Supercrew") was the first Swedish Bananbeskrivning game, as far as I know. The somewhat populat game "Matin\xe9" took the concept into a more traditional format, and right now I know of two games being developed in the genre: Rickard Ellim\xe4\xe4's "This is Pulp" (which I believe will be published in English) and my own "Drakar och bananer", which I might possibly translate maybe (I usually hardly write my games down, let alone translate them!). The genre has been restricted to "light" games, since it makes it a lot easier to weave in all the different elements, but I can actually see it work for more serious games, too. The difference would be that it would be more difficult to play well, which I think would highlight the SOU elements.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379746/#Comment_379746" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-25T09:18:46+00:00" title="May 25, 2012  9:18AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I've been interested in experimenting with is the Story Web idea from JeepLarp.

Do you have any links I could check out?<br/><br/>I have the impression that the freeform collectives (<i>Vi \xe5ker Jeep</i> and others) have a rather smal, or at least subtle, influence on this body of theory, which stems from the classical tabletop rpg community and the Swedish indie scene. In my view, Jeep is more connected to the pan-nordic larp scene, and a lot more interested in techniques than theory since it's basically a style of playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379797/#Comment_379797" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-26T02:06:48+00:00" title="May 26, 2012  2:06AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What DeBracy said.

As I said in the other thread, I had never even heard about these things before I came across them on Story Games.<br/><br/>That said, I'm interested in it, too, if there are links to be had.<br/><br/>I know one in our community has developed a tool he calls "spiderweb scenario", which is basically a way to prep a scenario with lots of prescripted things without making it railroady, but I doubt it's related. There's a lot of other theory about scenario building, too. Fish tank scenarios (in which you prepare a bunch of actors with relationships to each other and then let loose the PCs in it) has seen quite a lot of theory building from some people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
