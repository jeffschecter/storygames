The game is neat, and Tim is a fantastic GM.  After I left, I had some thoughts about the rules that I wanted to throw out there. I'm curious to see what Tim thinks, but I'd love input from anyone who's played Hero's Banner.<br/><br/><b>Passion</b>: This was, as I said, my first game of Hero's Banner, and I do not own a copy of the rules. Tim mentioned that he had brought in some new rules to this session that were/might be part of a revision he was working on. For passion rolls, rather than recalculating your passion ratings each time you rolled, you checked to see if your passion score reached a new tier. Each tier had a couple of arrays of ratings; when you reached a new tier, you could pick one array and assign the scores to your Hero/Blood/Conscience. I like the tiered system, eliminating tedious procedures is always a good idea. But once you go to the tiered system, why roll for random passion increase at all? Why not just move up to the next tier when you re-roll a conflict?<br/><br/><b>Breakdowns</b>: The breakdown rules may have also been new (wasn't sure); when your passion roll was higher than a certain threshold, you had a breakdown. I'm sort of curious about why breakdowns were designed this way. Two things didn't quite sit right with me about breakdowns; they felt simultaneously uncontrollable and too controlled. 1) They were too random. Would they happen at appropriate and interesting times? Maybe, maybe not, it was purely up to the dice. 2) They didn't have consequences; a breakdown didn't really send your character out of control. Their only mechanical impact was to allow players to choose to win or lose conflicts regardless of earlier rolls.<br/><br/>I was kicking around this formulation for breakdowns in my head today, and I'm wondering what people think about it: Anytime you reroll in a conflict, you can choose to have a breakdown. If you have a breakdown, you may ignore the results of rolls and choose to win or lose the conflict. However, you must also narrate how your character breaks down, and the consequences that breakdown. The GM <i>may choose</i> to add details to the consequences of your breakdown during narration. I haven't thought through all the ways this might change the game, but I like that it a) makes breakdowns less random and b) makes breakdowns less controlled. It gives you a choice: accept failure, or go after what you want but lose some of your (narrative) control.<br/><br/>All that said, I had a great time playing Hero's Banner. Thanks for teaching/running the game, Tim, it was good to meet you!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang" title="Tim C Koppang"><img alt="Tim C Koppang" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang">Tim C Koppang</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368498/#Comment_368498" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-19T12:54:41+00:00" title="March 19, 2012 12:54PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2012 3:48PM by Tim C Koppang.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David,<br/><br/>First of all, thank you for playing, and for posting your thoughts. Second, and I say this with no exaggeration, your post was just the kick in the creative pants that I needed. I think both of your comments are well put and thoughtful. I can say for certain that I will be implementing your suggestion regarding passion.  This in turn will force me to re-do the way breakdowns are handled.  Let me be specific:<br/><br/>Passion "tiers" were a step away from the more mathy implementation in the first edition of the rules. I like the tiers.  I think they steamline and speed play.  However, the passion increase rules, as you point out, are a bit of a relic. I am convinced that I at least need to play-test a version of the rules where I go all in on the new tiered system.  I am 99% sure that removing passion increase rolls will do at least two things for the better.  First, it will do away with needless dice rolling.  Second, and more importantly, it will clearly define the number of increases before each character reaches endgame.  This latter change is the one I'm most excited about because it will give the GM more control over game pacing.  One of the biggest challenges as GM is controlling the pace at which characters advance towards endgame.  Knowing how many passion increases each character needs will alleviate at least one unknown.  Thank you for the suggestion.<br/><br/>As for breakdowns, I like that they are random.  I like the feeling that you don't know exactly when your character is going to lose it.  Similarly, I wouldn't say that breakdowns have no consequences.  They most certainly have narrative consequences.  They also allow a player to transform a failure into a success, or vice versa.  Those are real consequences that matter in the game.  That said, with a change to the passion increase rules, I cannot leave the breakdown rules as is.  I'm contemplating the following:  After a conflict check, the player may request a breakdown.  He rolls 1d10.  If his roll equals or exceeds 10, then the character has a breakdown.  If not, then he adds whatever number he rolled to his "passion score."  On future breakdown checks, the player adds his passion score to his 1d10 roll.  This way a breakdown will be more likely to occur the more often a player requests a breakdown.  I think I would also limit the total number of breakdowns per character to 1.  This way breakdowns will be special as opposed to something that can happen over and over.<br/><br/>Your suggestion about ceding some narration rights during a breakdown to the GM is an interesting one.  I'll have to think about that.  I do know from experience that players typically have no problem narrating their character losing control.  In the rare situation where a player is more hesitant, I have always been able to encourage them to increase the drama.  This has always seemed to work quite well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DavidTC" title="DavidTC"><img alt="DavidTC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DavidTC">DavidTC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368516/#Comment_368516" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-19T14:22:59+00:00" title="March 19, 2012  2:22PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2012 3:32PM by DavidTC.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Tim,<br/><br/>I'm glad my comments were at least a little bit useful. It sounds like you're heading in a good direction with the passion rules. On breakdowns, it sounds like they do what you wanted them to; I was just expecting them to do something else.<br/><br/>I know its poor form to hack a game you've only played once, but my thoughts on passion rolls and breakdowns have been giving me this weird idea about a GM-less rule set for Hero's Banner, and I've got to write it down somewhere so I can get it out of my head. Here goes:<br/><br/><b>GM-less Hero's Banner</b><br/><br/>GM-less Hero's Banner is for 4 players.<br/><br/>All players create a hero with the three influences as per usual (Hero, Blood, Conscience). Each hero will have a set number of scenes to play out their story (probably between 4-6). Each player gets one scene for their hero at a time, going in clockwise order. When it is your turn for a scene, you play your character, and the rest of the players act as your Influences. The player to your left plays your Hero influence, and all Connections and NPCs related to it, the player across plays your Blood, and the player to your right plays your Conscience. The Influences set the scene, then play out their respective NPCs. If GMs cannot agree on who should control an NPC, the player decides.<br/><br/>Every scene will have a conflict; the player chooses a goal and Influence as per usual, and rolls against the Influence Rating. The player then has a choice; accept the outcome of the roll, and narrate his success or failure, or suffer a breakdown. In a breakdown, the hero rages against the injustice of fate and may win a conflict regardless of the die roll, but the player cedes narration rights to the player representing the Influence he rolled for. (Note there is no rerolling involved).<br/><br/>Heroes advance at the end of each scene; every advance brings a reassignment of ratings and connections, as per the advancement tier chart (not seen here, since it doesn't currently exist). After the final scenes have been played, each player narrates how their hero achieves their chosen goal, and how they die, as per usual<br/><br/>Preliminary Principles for Playing Influences:<ol><li>Set scenes that cut right to the tough choices; make sure those choices are related to the hero's Influences.</li><li>Drive towards conflict in every scene by pressuring the hero to give in to your Influence.</li><li>When the hero chooses a different Influence, show them the consequences of their choice right away or in a future scene.</li><li>When in conflict with other GMs, defer to the Influence in which the hero has the lowest rating, and let it drive the action.</li></ol>\nI have no idea if it would be fun, but the thought intrigues me. Or I guess I could just play Polaris instead :P<br/><br/>EDIT: And as I am reading the archives, I find that someone else has already had a very similar Polaris-inspired idea! Ha!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang" title="Tim C Koppang"><img alt="Tim C Koppang" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang">Tim C Koppang</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368527/#Comment_368527" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-19T15:27:27+00:00" title="March 19, 2012  3:27PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David,<br/><br/>Neat ideas.<br/><br/>You should definitely play Polaris because it's a good game!  That said, if you ever get a chance to play Hero's Banner as you described it, please let me know.  I contemplated a GM-less system similar (although not the same) as you described at one point in the design process.  I ultimately decided on a more traditional GM/Player split because (1) the two jobs are different yet very intense, and (2) the cognitive load involved in switching back and forth between player and GM would be quite high.  I want players to identify with their character.  I also want the GM to be able to coordinate all of the players' influences in a meaningful way.  I'm not saying that a GM-less system wouldn't work.  Heck, it may actually make the GM's job easier.  I'd be curious to hear how it goes for you if you ever get the chance.<br/><br/>Something else I thought I'd mention.  It is very tempting, from a design point of view, to say that a character advances each scene, regardless of outcome.  I've even tested such a system.  But it didn't work.  All of the tension among the influences evaporated.  I think this happens because a player's natural inclination is to favor, or concentrate on his highest ranking influences.  This means that the lower ranking influences enter into a negative feedback loop, and get ignored.  As the game stands now, the GM is almost forced to frame scenes around lower ranked influences.  If he doesn't, characters won't fail, and, therefore, won't advance to the next tier.  What this means is that a player cannot ignore his lower ranked influences.  All influences come back to haunt him no matter what the point spread.  And so during play it really feels like there is this struggle among the three different influences (or at least that's the way it's supposed to work).<br/><br/>I'm quite intrigued by your perspective on breakdowns.  To me, breakdowns have always been about the the character losing control of his emotions, but, at the same time, taking control of his own fate.  A breakdown, in my mind, has always been more about gaining control rather than losing control.  This is why the rules allow the player to switch a failure into a success, or success into a failure.  It is also why the player gets absolute narration rights.  Perhaps I need to explain that better in the book now that I think about it.<br/><br/>Your point of view is the opposite, but fascinating to me: breakdowns are very much about the loss of control.  In that context, I think your idea about giving narration rights to the GM is right on target.<br/><br/>As I said, feel free to play around with the system.  I'd love to hear how it goes!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
