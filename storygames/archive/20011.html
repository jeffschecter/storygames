The print version is now <b>$15</b>, and the pdf is just <b>$5</b>!\n<blockquote><br/>The Misery Index is a collection of eight tabletop games about human suffering.<br/><br/>This collection confronts subjects ranging from racial and cultural violence to sexual abuse, class conflict, and mental illness, and does so through the lens of multiple genres, including science fiction, sword and sorcery, cyberpunk, supernatural horror, and superhero fantasy. Each game is played differently, and all of the games are designed to be easy to learn, but hard to forget. The games draw inspiration from a number of sources, including role playing games, board games, card games, and improvisational theater. The mechanics have been carefully chosen to compliment each game\u2019s subject matter.</blockquote>\nYou can buy either version, or a print+pdf bundle here:<br/><a href="http://www.miserytourism.com/miseryindex/" rel="nofollow">http://www.miserytourism.com/miseryindex/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
