                    Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I've heard some good things about the Chivilry mechanic in pendragon (did I get the game right?)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm wondering how this mechanic works. what is so great about it? Does it really make the game?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Alex                </div>

                            Pendragon has a lot of mechaincs. <br/><br/>I'm not fully sure which one is the Chivalry mechanic though (unless you mean the Armor of Chivalry, but that doesn't sound like it.) Can you give us more detail? Do you maybe mean the traits and passions system?                        </div>

                            The game has a set of 20 personality traits, valued between 1 and 20 (generally).<br/><br/>If your trait is below 16, you do not have to act on it, though it may change if you don't.<br/><br/>If your trait is above 16, the GM may insist you act on it even where you would rather not.<br/><br/>The player chooses whether a trait is above 16 or not, so the player chooses whether the GM can enforce certain behaviour if not.<br/><br/>If certain traits which reflect chivalric ideals are all over 16 you get an in-game bonus.<br/><br/>So, if you choose as a player to allow the GM to force you on occasion to roleplay in a chivalric way you get an in-game mechanical bonus.  If you don't want the GM to be able to do that, you pass on the bonus.<br/><br/>Also, having traits above 16 gets you glory, which is a reputation stat in the game.  High glory also gets you a mechanical bonus.  You can though get glory other ways should you prefer to, but generally you get glory by acting like a knight.                        </div>

                            What Balbinus said, but I'd stress Glory. The game is pretty much all about accumulating it and in a good way; min-max for Glory collection, and you end up behaving precisely like a knight in Arthurian myth ought to be acting. It's one of the best reward mechanics I've ever seen in an RPG.                        </div>

                            I'll just step in for one sec to say that while Balbinus's explinations are partly correct, they miss a lot of the fine gradations of how passions and traits work in the game, and the way that using them with the actual dice mechanics (rather than just the you do/don't explained above) ties player choices and consequences into the Pendragon world in a very powerful way. <br/><br/>Traits are brilliant because when you use them as a full part of the mechanical system they create a spiral of intent effect that does a wonderful job of replicating the development (revelation?) of personality in the source material. <br/><br/>Plus, they offer a rocking way to solve disputes outside the skill system -- such as using your Humble to impress a priest, or your Just to force another knight to accept surrender. This aspect, unfortunatly, doesn't get a full development in the text, though it is shown in several of the examples. <br/><br/>Really, I've often thought of redoing Pendragon to get rid of the skills and attributes and making the game run off pure Traits and Passions. Rather than rolling your Sword with a bonus from your Just to kill the Black Knight, you roll your Just. Assuming, of course, your motives are just. If you're doing it for personal gain, then your Greed becomes your stat. It'd take some work, but it could rock.                        </div>
