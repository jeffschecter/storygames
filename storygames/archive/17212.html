I would expand it to 2 questions: "How does my character feel about this?" and "What are we trying to do here?".<br/><br/>The answer to the second question will remain relatively constant. But there are 2 reasons to keep it in mind. One, because it is inclusive of the group and the sharing part of shared fiction creation - it leads to some of those group-oriented things on the list in a way that the more inner-focused first question can sometimes lead one to forget. And two, because the interplay between the two questions can lead the player to more easily embrace choices that are sometimes not the most obvious choice for the character, but add more effectively to the group fiction and still make plenty of sense for the character.<br/><br/>In other words, just focusing on one's own character can, in the worst case, lead to turtling. Adding in a second notion that focuses on the "us" can reduce the likelihood of that being a problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard" title="EpistolaryRichard"><img alt="EpistolaryRichard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard">EpistolaryRichard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390586/#Comment_390586" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-17T15:00:07+00:00" title="September 17, 2012  3:00PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A theme running through some of these is 'playing the story' through playing the character rather than just 'playing the character' through the character. I'm interested in the tools that games provide the players to allow them to see the story rather than just see their own character. As well as your basic character goals (Fiasco Needs, Forsooth! Motivations) "This is how you can help or frustrate my character", you're seeing games come out with character targets as well (Oaths in Durance and Forsooth! for example). "This is where I'd like you to  push my character." Alongside that you have games like Archipelago that provide a common language for players to provide quality control over one another.<br/><br/>The other thing that caught my interest was status. People will bang on and on about status in theatre improv. I'm generalising horribly here, but generally higher status characters are more proactive and therefore more critical to the success of the overall story. It's natural for an actor, as they become more confident, to graduate to higher status roles so that they can do more to influence the success of the story and newer actors have a chance to learn without to be more reactive. But then you go and put a great actor in a low status character and (so long as they stay in low status rather than pulling a Jeeves) they're supporting the story rather than leading it, it can end us as quite special.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390679/#Comment_390679" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-18T10:54:26+00:00" title="September 18, 2012 10:54AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ooh.
