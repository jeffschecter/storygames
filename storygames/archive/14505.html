Here is the totally stupid and ridiculous backstory and reskinning thingy that I wrote.  Comments welcome.<br/><br/>Angry Birds: The Inevitable Fall<br/><br/>Long ago, the realm of Pigonia lived in peace will all the other animal kingdoms.  The Laughing King was served faithfully by his order of Knights Architectural, dedicated to building piggy homes out of materials not easily destroyed by wolves and other predators.  As time passed, the Laughing King divided his land into seven districts, and appointed wise and adorable governors to oversee the progress of each one.  However, being a prudent and just King (as well as an exceptionally round one), he stopped expanding his borders before encroaching on the territory of any other animals.  The piggies settled in to friendly relations with their bird, cow, and even dragon neighbors.<br/>One fateful morning, an exceptionally stupid and hungry young piggy, whose name has been forcibly removed from the historical <br/>record, decided he wanted to know what those round white things sitting in the nest of the neighboring redbirds tasted like.  Of course, the birds were furious at this massacre of their children!  They flew (literally) into a rage, and immediately destroyed the foolish young piggy\u2019s home, killing not only him, but also his entire family.<br/><br/>The local governor, Minister Mortimer, tried to sue for peace, arguing that the death of so many pigs more than made up for the crime committed by the theft and consumption of the eggs.  But the redbirds would have none of it, recruiting other species of birds into their genocidal crusade.  So intent on revenge are the birds that they have no regard for their own safety, often hurling themselves bodily into piggy abodes, their only goal the deaths of as many of their foe as possible.<br/>With three of their districts completely destroyed, and many towns in the remaining districts rendered uninhabitable due to the incessant attacks, the once great nation of Pigonia has been reduced to just four regional capitals: Pigtown, Piggyplace, Southtail, and Hogsmud.  The Knights Architectural build their structures ever sturdier, only to be countered at every turn by ever more angry and determined birds.<br/><br/>To make matters worse, as the front line defenders of the kingdom, the Knights are often the first to die, and it is rare in these sad days for a young pig to join their ranks.  Indeed, a curious apathy has crept over much of the piggy populace, as deadly in its way as the bird attacks.  They simply spend their time wallowing, and pretending like everything is fine.  Especially damaging is the people\u2019s refusal to give the Architects the funding they need to design new buildings and mine new materials, even as the birds continue their deadly assault with ever-more-deadly ferocity.<br/><br/>Roles in the game<br/>Knight \u2014 This is your main character, one of the noble Architects who is in charge of piggy housing!

Whenever one of the three adults was in a conflict with one of them it was fine, it was just that they didn't know how to productively play off of each other in Polaris' conflict system.<br/><br/>So, as a hack I think this works very well; I changed the names of some things but didn't do more than that and everything worked fine.  The fiction seemed reasonably robust because of having friends and enemies as actual personified (pigsonified?) NPCs.  The most interesting plotline and the one that progressed the furthest was an attempt at a bird-pig peace conference, which of course was just a ruse and doomed to failure but led to some interesting and fun narration.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
