But this time it\u2019s only to share the love and what I try to say here is: go and play \u201cLove in the Time of Sei\xf0\u201d because you will have a great time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI facilitated \u201cLove in the Time of Sei\xf0\u201d at one of the conventions (Inne Sfery) in Wroc\u0142aw, Poland last weekend as one of the games on demand. I played it with complete strangers, so it was even more exciting as everything they did was a huge surprise to me. It took us three hours (including explaining the rules).<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, it\u2019s great that despite the setting being determined, there are a lot of things to come up with along the play, for example how exactly the magic of Sei\xf0kona works. So we started with pinpointing the sei\xf0 and we assigned it to the stars and reading future and recalling past form them. (Oh, imagine the great colour scene with Sei\xf0kona wearing long dress not embroidered with stars but made of real stars!) Then we created a story incorporating some Slavic myths into the Nordic legend by adding the fern flower which is said to blossom only once a year. We made it a symbol of the kingdom and it was forbidden to cut the flower. So the Earl obviously did it. After this we could immediately switch to the King\u2019s hall to see the crown falling down from his head and right to the flashback with him being crowned by Sei\xf0kona. But as <i>this might not be quite so easy!</i> it turned out that Sei\xf0kona somehow made a mistake pronouncing the crowning formula. The effect was terrifying \u2013 without her the King had no power and authority. So she became his lover to save the kingdom. But the effort of the crowing formula exhausted her making her unable to perform it once again. So she knew that to anoint the new king new sei\xf0kona would be needed. But the Princess cannot become one because she lost her virginity with the Kinght. Sounds great, doesn\u2019t it? Then we had even more twists and ended up with the marriage of the Princess and the Eral (being an incarnation of or being blessed by one of the Kings who betrayed his country) and losing the power of sei\xf0 forever. It gave us, the players, great feeling that the old time of some myths and legends is over.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt\u2019s perfect game to teach people how the multiform really works. We had no problem switching between scenes in character and the out of character negotiations. Phrases and cards really support that way of playing. And what\u2019s even more important to me, they help players to create the story <i>together</i>. By controlling themes (they work even better than the elements in Archipelago II to my mind) and events all participants stay concentrated also when not in spotlight. Plus it enhances players\u2019 creativity giving them motifs to get inspired.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also seems to me that there is a lot of material we just didn\u2019t manage to use at all. Some questions were not answered, some were not even asked, some themes were not exposed. I can imagine playing that game again and having a <i>completely different</i> story. And I\u2019m going to check if it\u2019s so soon!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295003/#Comment_295003" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T13:42:57+00:00" title="September 28, 2010  1:42PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hear, hear!  Thank you for posting this, Karina.  It's fun to hear about how others have experienced this wonderful game.<br><br>A dress made of stars!  You went really "high-magic" with the setting.  Beautiful!<br><br>I've played LitToS four times with four different groups.  It's played very differently each time and while some of the games were better than others, all went well.<br><br>I also appreciate the things in this game which help the players listen actively and stay engaged with the story, with each other, and with the characters' themes.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295007/#Comment_295007" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T13:55:44+00:00" title="September 28, 2010  1:55PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dzi\u0119kuj\u0119 Karina! I'm grinning from ear to ear - your game sounds fantastic. I love the high magic feel and the way you extinguished that in a suitably mythic way. I'm particularly pleased that you had such an easy time with the game as a "teaching text" - that was a design goal, based on Matthijs' and my experience with Archipelago II.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
