I'm the guy who gets assigned to GM or has some new hotness he wants to run, but the whole group has this Gamer ADD thing going on. So I committed myself to running a few games at GenCon OZ '09 and hitched my wagon to Indie Games on Demand. iGoD was Fantastic by the way and I can't say enough good things about those guys. I'm already looking forward to participating next year.<br/><br/>So the games on my menu were Primetime Adventures, Dogs in the Vineyard, Panty Explosion and Bliss Stage. I ended up running two sessions of Dogs and one of Panty Explosion.<br/><br/>Dogs session one went well, although I feel I really didn't push the situation hard enough. My town involved a woman who thought she was a man in a woman's body an acted accordingly, plus those who wanted to hurt her because of it. Generally a messed up situation and it got fairly intense at a few points, but the town needs tweaking if I was going to use it again and I really could have pressed harder. My favourite moment was when one of the Dogs did the whole 'now give me the gun' at the end of a tense almost-gunfight when he could see I didn't have the dice to resist and it just worked. I was also surprised at the level of interest in Dogs and expected it to be harder to sell.<br/><br/>Panty Explosion went really well despite the fact that I'd never even PLAYED it before. The players did a lot of the work for me, building their own rivalries and plot-hooks. We barely got around to the demon side of things and instead it all ended being about one girl trying to steal back the boyfriend of another. My favourite moment was when one of the psychic girls got sick of rolling d6s, pulled out the powers and just absolutely crushed her rival and left her a sobbing wreck.<br/><br/>Overall, it was great fun and it gave me a much needed boost to my GMing confidence.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234236/#Comment_234236" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-25T09:35:39+00:00" title="September 25, 2009  9:35AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure what you want out of this thread, but hooray!

Typically, you basically take a stripped down version of the rules (3:16 probably doesn't need the rules stripped down, and that's why it'd be perfect for this sort of thing), and you take advantage of wherever you happen to be and use the obstacles of reality as "in game" props. The players find themselves in a dark corridor, play it up as a claustrophobic scene. The players are in the open and you could imagine alien snipers on a nearby balcony or an ambush from a series of nearby doors...play to that.<br/><br/>For some of the deeper moments, you might sit down at a table or find a convenient place to roll some dice, but on the whole you try to avoid dice at all.<br/><br/>I'll be bringing along a few dozen replica energy rifles, some other appropriately military props and maybe some alien masks (for the co-GMs to wear [and anyone else we can round up for a bit of fun to play some aliens]).<br/><br/>If anyone else has got ideas for this type of event, it'd be much appreciated.<br/><br/><span style="color: #FF0000;">V</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234527/#Comment_234527" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-28T08:12:37+00:00" title="September 28, 2009  8:12AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, that sounds fantastic.

We are the second largest RPG event (after RPGA) and offered 120 spaces for play over two days! I would like to public thank Evil Hat Productions, Contested Grounds Studios and Gregor Hutton of Box Ninja Games for supporting the event by providing resources, promotional material and swag for the event. Thanks guys!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, thanks to all the GM's that helped out with the event, without you guys we would have had nothing! Collectively we showed more than 20 different games to a public who had mostly never heard of indy games - so top work there.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, we launched The Stockade at Gen Con Oz this year. This is an endeavour to support Australian game creators by fostering a helpful community and providing a place to "touch base". That doesn't mean no-one else is invited, though, and it would be great to have game creators from around the world share their experiences of publishing with out community. You can check out the Stockade at http://www.stockade.wordpress.com<br/>\n<br/>\n- Nathan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
