In the last game The Owl, after escaping the Hand of Sorrow, had landed on an asteroid called Nematron for refueling and Naomi was talked into coming out of retirement by her former Master Mother Six for just one more fight.<br/><br/>On the morning of game-day, I had scoped out a few scenes that I thought would be good follow-ups from the previous session (see write-up here).  Instead of holding them close to my vest, I decided to tease the group a bit, so hours before the game, I sent the following email to the playgroup:<br/><br/>\u201cTonight at 9:30 PM EST we continue our story of Lady Blackbird.<br/><br/>What will the answers to the following questions be?<br/><br/>    * Will Naomi win the pit fight against Briarea and gain knowledge of where to find the Pirate King Uriah from Mother Six, her former master?<br/><br/>    * Who is that person in the crowd watching the pit fight that Captain Vance saw briefly and why does he recognize them?<br/><br/>    * Has Snargle found love?  Will he join Mother Six\u2019s ratling gang?<br/><br/>    * What\u2019s that noise Arkam heard just outside his quarters in The Owl?  Is that the sound of a lady\u2019s screaming muffled?\u201d<br/><br/>Highlights:<br/><br/>* After bringing Chuck (who was unable to attend the last game session) up to speed, we opened with a description of Naomi Bishop entering the pit as a crowd began to fill in the seats above it; rather than push through the combat, we changed scenes over to Snargle and his new ratling buddy<br/><br/>* Nobody could remember the name of the ratling guard who\u2019d coupled with Snargle and I had yet to review the recording to find it, so we dubbed him Nezumi.  Snargle talked Nezumi into taking a job on The Owl<br/><br/>* Snargle and Nezumi headed over to the pit to catch the fight after betting each other on who would win: Naomi or Briarea<br/><br/>* Back at the pit, Naomi was preparing herself for the fight and Captain Vance decided to move up to the stands and watch.  Across the arena, Vance saw someone he hadn\u2019t seen since his days in the Imperial Fleet.  I asked Chuck (Vance\u2019s player) to describe the ex-Imperial who he recognized; Chuck quickly sketched out a very cool Steampunk Bounty Hunter named Javere (I\u2019m guessing on spelling, Chuck pronounced his name \u201cZha-verr\u201d, rhyming like \u201cYa\u2019\u2013bare\u201d).  It turns out Javere was one of the crewmen that Captain Vance knew from his memory of playing cards together (see the first game write-up here).  The two had an intense scene that began innocuously as they pretended to catch up, but when Vance asked Javere to speak plainly, the bounty hunter revealed he was on the trail of The Owl and asked Vance to hand over Naomi, to leave her behind for the bounty.  Vance refused, told Javere that he was doing something right for once and asked him to trust him.  Before the two came to an accord, they were interrupted as\u2026<br/><br/>* Snargle and Nezumi walked up and inserted themselves into the conversation; Snargle introduced the \u201cnew crew member\u201d to Vance and Javere disappeared from their huddle.  Vance told Snargle to prep the ship for a speedy exit and he left them immediately.  Once Snargle was gone, Vance told Nezumi that he had no openings on the ship and that he would not be joining the crew, and the two found a good seat and started watching the fight.  That\u2019s when the champion pit-fighter Briarea entered the ring<br/><br/>* Briarea stood a meager five feet tall, a wisp of a girl with tribal tattoos and piercings across her face.  She wore cloth wrappings around her small hands that were covered in brass tacks, a simple breechcloth and a strip of leather across her breasts.  Braided into her hair were shards of glass, but even more noteworthy were her long, pointed ears showing she was an elf girl.  As Naomi stood strong and proud, towering over her, the elf girl shifted back and forth like a feral animal ready to spring and smile with teeth that had been filed to points.  As the announcer finished regaling the may fighters bested by each competitor, the fight commenced, the two closed on each other\u2026<br/><br/>* And we cut to another scene with Snargle jogging into the hangar bay to prep The Owl for takeoff to see three ratlings skulking up the gangplank and entering the ship.  Snargle heard a muffled female scream from inside followed by the sounds of a struggle, so he tried to set up a trip wire to stop the ratlings as they exited, but didn\u2019t have enough time.  Snargle was run over by the ratlings as they escaped with the unconscious form of Lady Blackbird.  Snargle ran into the ship and started prepping it for launch when Kale Arkam finally woke up (i.e. Arkam\u2019s player Daniel was able to make it online) and ordered Snargle to help him find Lady Blackbird<br/><br/>* We switch back to the pit where Naomi and Briarea are fighting.  The fight was brutal, with Naomi using her size and strength to keep Briarea from striking a vital blow and forcing her to wear herself out.  After a seeming eternity, Naomi slammed the elf girl to the wall and stoked the girl\u2019s fire even further with quiet, powerful words, \u201cIf you want something to hurt and hate, let me give you a better target\u201d.  Naomi then leapt up out of the pit, grabbed Mother Six by the neck and demanded the path to the Pirate King.  Mother Six cried out, begging for mercy, and then squealing that she doesn\u2019t know how to find Uriah, that she lied because she needed the money from the fight and urged Naomi to find her answers at Nightport.  Mother Six\u2019s ratling horde was unable to intercede for fear of hurting Mother Six, so they waited for Naomi to give them a clear shot.  As Captain Vance rushed over from his seat, Naomi tossed Mother Six down into the pit with Briarea.  Before the ratlings could shoot Naomi, Vance tackled her and used his warping power to send her to the hangar bay with The Owl.<br/><br/>* Naomi ported in to see Snargle and Arkam dashing off to find Lady Blackbird and joined them.  Captain Vance raced out of the pit arena between stymied ratlings and away from the blubbering Mother Six and joined the rest of the crew in the bazaar.  Arkam spotted some ratlings who looked like they were standing guard at the entrance to a dugout bar<br/><br/>* The crew rushed the ratlings (while Snargle snuck away from the crew) and before the ratlings could react, Arkam tried a shatter spell on the ratling\u2019s weapons but ended up destroying their liquor instead.  Before they could react, Vance was on them both, pointing pistols in their faces and demanding where Lady Blackbird was.  One ratling tried to talk tough, so Vance shot him dead.  The other dropped a pellet (he pooped himself) and told them Lady Blackbird was taken on Mother Six\u2019s orders and that she was inside.<br/><br/>* Vance led the crew into the backroom to find possibly twenty ratlings with guns trained on him, many of them using the shackled Lady Blackbird as cover.  Vance told them all, \u201cMother Six is dead, who\u2019s next?\u201d which caused the ratlings to cower until one of them, Nezumi, said, \u201cHey, you guys looking for a gang?\u201d  Vance declined the offer, saying they had no room in their ship (to which the ratling protested that they could sleep three a bunk) and the ratlings handed over Lady Blackbird<br/><br/>* The crew returned to The Owl quickly in hopes of avoided any future Imperial entanglements, expecting to find Snargle prepping the ship, but instead, they realized he was nowhere to be found\u2026<br/><br/>Observations:<br/><br/>* With the addition of the ratling in the past two sessions and the elf pit fighter in this session, the setting is getting more of a TSoY flavor, which has been really fun<br/><br/>* The turn of the game to violence was exciting, but ended up pushing Snargle out of some of the story; hopefully, this will be the theme of the next session as the group comes to grips with the difference between smugglers and pirates.<br/><br/>* The group was very interactive, even though Arnold and Daniel had never played together, they were very interesting as a pair<br/><br/>* Daniel again nailed Arkam in a short scene, his portrayal of the small talk Arkam ad when the crew entered the dugout bar weapons drawn was classic stuff<br/><br/>* Having Chuck play Vance was much more fun than having him as an NPC; Vance took charge and that\u2019s just not something I\u2019m comfy with when he\u2019s an NPC<br/><br/>* For the bounty hunter Javere, I handed the character creation to Chuck and he jumped at the opportunity, deftly crafted a character with a strong connection to his PC by reincorporating the flashback scene from a previous game as part of the NPC introduction; I tapped Arnold for some ideas on Javere\u2019s costume since he\u2019s good at that kind of thing and he described a killer steampunk bad*pickles*<br/><br/>* Speaking of bad*pickles*, I enjoyed forestalling the pit fight, pushing it later and later and building tension around it; Mick reacted very well to having his scene late in the game and the result of the fight was very exciting and a great character moment for Naomi<br/><br/>* I am a bit worried that the ability to stack up large die pools might cause some conflicts to become fait accompli\u2019s, but I hope we can work past it<br/><br/>* Another mechanics concern I have is that sometimes I happen to like extended conflicts; we may need to hack something like that onto the game at some point                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/theloneamigo" title="theloneamigo"><img alt="theloneamigo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/546/n3LSBO7Z43MJI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/theloneamigo">theloneamigo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234170/#Comment_234170" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-24T19:41:32+00:00" title="September 24, 2009  7:41PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds you've been having a great game. I love the idea of re-framing the game with a set of questions after the initial situation is dealt with. In the game of Lady Blackbird I played in, the group initially struggled to find a hook once we escaped the Sorrow, and spent a while wandering aimlessly through scenes looking for a hook. More aggressive situation framing is an obvious cure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez" title="Daniel_M_Perez"><img alt="Daniel_M_Perez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dmperez.com/offline/avatars/danny_avatar_03_32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez">Daniel_M_Perez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234231/#Comment_234231" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-25T08:46:05+00:00" title="September 25, 2009  8:46AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 25, 2009 8:46AM by Daniel_M_Perez.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm playing Kale Arkam in this game.
