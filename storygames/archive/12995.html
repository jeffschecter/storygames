I am raven-haired, small-breasted, but statuesque."  <br/>Location:  "The Forest of Flowers"<br/>Goal:  "Harvest pollen for my song."<br/>Monster:  humanoid insect that looks like a preying mantis, kills fast, up-front, savage, singly - 5<br/>Lover:  druid of the forest, innocent, forbidden (vow of chastity), open hearted, knowledgeable - 2<br/><br/>I described the forest as made up of gargantuan hyacinths, tulips, foxglove - giant bumblebees the size of dogs droned as they moved between the stems, thick as tree trunks.  She levitated in - her song creates a vortex that allows her to fly.  She met the druid, who had the insect-monster in a cage (he called it "the cicada") - he wouldn't tell her where the glade of crocuses that contained the pollen she sought was - powerful magic, that pollen, and he was sworn to secrecy.  <br/><br/>My wife who is not a gamer and hardly ever does this stuff was much more creative than me.  Maybe I was power-gaming (I can get a die if I have the monster attack her)...so most of the time I was just finding new ways for the monster to attack her, but she came up with:<br/>- knee high fairies that she befriended and *were* willing to show her where the glade was - "Meet me at dusk tomorrow" - which gave me the opportunity for the druid to say he would give up his vow for her, (she turned him down)<br/>- butterflies the size of horses that they rode together, just for fun - how the butterflies would fly depending on the emotions of their riders.  the rejected druid's butterfly flew low, she flew high, hopeful - and I described the cicada pouncing on the druid's butterfly, rending it, and injuring the druid.  <br/>- she dismounts her butterfly and flies via her song - the cicada is angered by it and chases her - the druid is spared for now<br/>- she can't circle back to the druid, she can't keep her date with the fairy - she tries something drastic, she stops singing and lands in a patch of giant ferns - underneath the ferns the fairies, who had been watching catch her in a net made from fern fronds.  the fairy starts leading her to the glade of pollen - and the cicada kills him and swats her down a hill, and there's the druid (bandaged), who uses his magic to stall the monster<br/>- the dog-sized bumblebees come to them and their droning paralyzes the cicada.  she embraces the druid.  ("And you get your second lover die!" I say.  "I know," she says.  So the rules work in that way, giving her a bonus to roleplay love.)  I have the druid kiss her and...the bumblebees leave...and the cicada dismembers the druid.<br/>- in her rage, she invents a new song - one that paralyzes the cicada, so she can pick up the one-armed druid and fly away with him.  But she's too heavy to get much altitude, so I describe the fairies scattering as she runs among them and the sounds of the cicada as it approaches behind her, closer, closer, and - he gets her.  And that's my fifth monster die.<br/><br/>Something that wasn't clear - how do you "win" the match?  Simply a higher total?  She had 11 to my 13 total, and two good dice (she rolled 1-1-3-6), so as I understood it she lost but was able to specify one accomplishment.  She chose to save the lover.  I said, "That means you'll die, but that's pretty cool."  She said, "Ok."  I guess that's either "leave alone gracefully" or "stay there with him" depending on how you look at it.<br/><br/>So she described how she used her paralyzing song to hold the cicada, and in the lyrics of her operatic paralyzing song she told the druid to run, and he refused, and she said if he loved her he would go, and he did.  And then, when he was safe, she closed her eyes and stopped singing.  Cut to black.<br/><br/>Whole thing took 50 minutes - she didn't want to take a turn as "I", she was creatively drained.<br/><br/>Pretty cool.  Really brought out my wife's imagination.  Pollen for her song, and the emotion-controlled butterflies...nice.  <br/><br/>It still feels like a two-player RPG, in that it's a lot of work...for me, it seems like RPG's need 4-5 people to get that momentum where they start to feel unstoppable, where the game is carrying you along.  If that makes any sense.  Now, if we could somehow get that momentum into a 2-player game...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292961/#Comment_292961" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-10T23:26:27+00:00" title="September 10, 2010 11:26PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 10, 2010 11:28PM by Hans_c-o.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite><br/>Something that wasn't clear - how do you "win" the match?

The book never says it in so many words, but It's mostly intuitive, if not strictly instructional, and this piece of text makes it clear enough for me:<br/><br/>P.18, <b>The Climax</b>. <i>...We have seen the totals and the Goal is now nearly resolved...</i><br/><br/>It never says, "highest total wins," but it tells you to total your dice, and on P.16, <b>Ending the Match</b>, it says "<i>...If you are losing, you may topple my column...</i>"<br/><br/>Which makes it pretty clear to me that you win by having a higher total. The book never gives another way, and that's the default way most (all?) people read dice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang" title="Tim C Koppang"><img alt="Tim C Koppang" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang">Tim C Koppang</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293063/#Comment_293063" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-12T08:37:31+00:00" title="September 12, 2010  8:37AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2010 8:38AM by Tim C Koppang.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>It still feels like a two-player RPG, in that it's a lot of work...for me, it seems like RPG's need 4-5 people to get that momentum where they start to feel unstoppable, where the game is carrying you along.

I think that S/Lay w/Me picks up some steam after multiple sessions with the same characters. Once you get to know the characters, get a feel for what they are about, there is more momentum in the game. However, I understand what you're saying about two-player rpgs feeling like more "work."  After all, you can't rely on anyone but yourself and your partner to carry the story forward. You can't sit back and rest while someone else does the creative lifting for a while. I think that's the trade-off for the intensity that often comes with the two-players experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293071/#Comment_293071" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-12T10:16:59+00:00" title="September 12, 2010 10:16AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like her goal and all the imaginative color she came up with.
