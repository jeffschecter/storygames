And the other player was the princess of the realm, turned assassin cultist. In end he fell for her and slowly won her over despite her plans to sacrifice him to the cult. It was big fun and reminded me of a David Gemmel book - with the war, assassins and underlying love story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122711/#Comment_122711" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-29T10:53:48+00:00" title="January 29, 2008 10:53AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Being the player of the "thief with a heart of gold" Ryan mentions above, I'll weigh in. <br/><br/>First off, I tend toward the good guy types. It's not uncommon I play the dark evil sorts, but as a rule, I tend to play the good guys. Which is why Omid (the thief) decided to help the executioner who was going to kill him, and stayed loyal to the mage who tried to hang him out to dry. When the game started, I thought I was toast, with many best interests turned against Omid. I was determined to go out as the victim of the wicked age, and instead, became a sort of minor hero. <br/><br/>One thing that I think had a big effect on this was the Best Interests.. Or rather, that they don't appear to have any mechanical support. I'm not sure I like or dislike this. If they were mechanically supported so that we had to play to accomplish them, or had some encouragement to do so, things may have been very different. As it was, the events of the fiction as well as the vision of the character I had made me abandon one of them almost immediately into the game, and I think perhaps the same happened with Jahangir, the executioner. Whether this is a feature or a bug will really depend on whether you like the ability to reverse yourself so easily. Yes, Jahangir wanted to execute Omid, and Omid wanted to frame Jahangir for the burglary. By the end, it was pretty obvious that these had fallen by the wayside. Jahangir had attempted to be merciful and almost kind to the young man he was to execute, so in turn Omid didn't attempt to frame him. When Omid helped the blind Jahangir, his sense of obligation made him follow the young rogue without trying to catch and apprehend him. <br/><br/>Anyway, brief impression of the game. I look forward to playing again, either as Omid, or as some other figure in the ongoing chronicles of this wicked age.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122725/#Comment_122725" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-29T11:25:39+00:00" title="January 29, 2008 11:25AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Being the player that caused much of the theft, vengeance, murder, and betrayal, I'll also weigh in.<br/><br/>I think because I ruthlessly pursued Ashur Seen's (The most Wicked man of the Age) interests, it made my character act in very wicked ways. I think it's possible to have these glimmers of good by having characters that act more selflessly, and are willing to give up what was once their best interests. I'm playing a character that doesn't do that, he pursues what he really wants despite the more reasonable and usually less selfish choices that can be made.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122729/#Comment_122729" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-29T11:41:51+00:00" title="January 29, 2008 11:41AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems to me that, mechanically speaking, any character whose Interests are opposed to "bad people" (which most of the character are) and uses With Love and For Others in play is going to come off as a good person.

And all of the jerks, save the Djinn, started showing softer sides, weaknesses, and humanity. Some of them just became more human villains.

If I draw (runs to Abulafia) "The unscrupulous landlady of a roadside wayhouse." there is nothing preventing me from brainstorming "The highway sheriff who desires to bring down the thieving landlady" as my character and making him powerful when acting For Others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122809/#Comment_122809" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-29T15:26:07+00:00" title="January 29, 2008  3:26PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing I noticed from our game is that we all stuck to characters directly implied in the oracle. Not a single character, PC or NPC, came from outside those implied by the oracle. Mind you, given that one of the lines of the oracle involved a "convocation of mages", that made it a little easier. My PC and Brennan's PC both came from the same line, and Ashur, a reoccurring character who came in for free because he was at the top of the Owe List, was fit into one of the implied mages, even. So a mage previously established to be at least a bit of a bastard, a criminal and a paid killer.<br/><br/>Given that, I don't think we had any real idea of being good guys when we first began, though when I added "with a heart of gold" on to my description, that was the first step toward being good. Ryan also thought it foretold my doom.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
