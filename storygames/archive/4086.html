Chris Pramas and another dude from Wizards (who shall remain nameless) gave the panel. Chris was actually rather open-minded and even-keeled. Mr WOTC, predictably, talked like there was no other god but D&amp;D. He also talked down to the audience and spoke in gamer lilt.<br/><br/>During the panel, a show of hands was taken. By my count there were 100 people in the room. 85 men, 15 women. 80% the 100 identified with D&amp;D in some way. 5% identified with small press games in some way (that included me and Jared!). The other 15% seemed to identify with WW, SJG, GR and Mongoose games. <br/><br/>At one point Mr WOTC gave us a long knowing speech about how hard it was to be the GM and keep the players on the rails (I kid you not). After this reverential complaining went on for at least 20 minutes, I shouted up, "If the role of the GM is so problematic, why not get rid of it?" The room went quiet. There was one plaintive cry of, "Because it would be a board game then." Mr WOTC then came back to life and rumbled on, "Well, I like GMing..." I like GMing, too, but that didn't answer my question.<br/><br/>The actual Q&amp;A format for the panel was ass. You had to get in line in front of a mic, wait for your turn, speak your piece and move aside. Bleh. Once the line formed, all you could see was gamer-butt.<br/><br/>Anyway, one wily little gamer jumped up to the mic and stunned me and Jared (and our other friend). He was clearly annoyed, "You talk like D&amp;D is the only game. You talk like there's no other style of roleplaying except for putting players on rails. Have you heard of these games?" He held up a copy of Bliss Stage (!), "Have you heard of what Ben Lehman and Vincent Baker are doing with games?" <br/><br/>Jared and I cheered for him.<br/>-L                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia" title="Parthenia"><img alt="Parthenia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/146/nKIT0S5D0Y5QY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia">Parthenia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91198/#Comment_91198" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T22:44:14+00:00" title="August 28, 2007 10:44PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What was his reply?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91199/#Comment_91199" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T22:44:40+00:00" title="August 28, 2007 10:44PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 28, 2007 10:45PM by misuba.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WotC dude was probably Chris Perkins, a very nice man on the whole.

It's not the answer for everybody, but saying "Well, I know this part of the game is problematic, but it also brings me a lot of joy, so I'm going to work to make it less problematic, rather than throw the baby out with the bathwater" seems an adequate response to the question you actually asked.<br/><br/>It's not an answer to the question "Once you've <i>chosen</i> to play a GMed game rather than a GMless one, why do you concentrate so much on the negative stuff that troubles you about that, rather than pitching us on the joys that brought you to GMing in the first place?", but then that's not the question that was asked.<br/><br/>I'm actually also sort of with the guy who said it would make it more like a board game ... certainly GMless games benefit from explicit rules and turn-structures in many of the same ways that board-games do.  I can see commonalities, though I think on whole that they're strengths.  If there were more dialogue I'd ask him "So what about a GMed game is more to your taste than a board-game model?"<br/><br/>Anyway, sounds like a panel where the format made it hard to get any dialogue, and the distance between the parties made it blatantly obvious that a dialogue was called for.

The question was, in essence, "What's the secret to being a great Dungeon Master?"<br/>\n<br/>\nChris Pramas and I both took a crack at the question. My answer went something like this: A great Dungeon Master is a master of improv, which is to say that when the adventure runs off the rails, the great DM can "go with the flow" and improvise to keep the game interesting and fun for the players. However, a great DM also knows how to get the game group back on the rails. Sometimes this means presenting an illusion of choice, but knowing full well how the players are likely to respond, whereby the DM prods the players so gently in the right direction that the players think they're still masters of their own fate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was horrified when the young man who asked the question resented the idea that the DM would railroad the party in such a manner. On the drive home after the seminar, I thought about my response, as well as my own DM-ing experiences. Was I wrong? Did the young man misunderstand me? Then it occurred to me that my answer my incomplete, that I'd failed to mention something crucial: The true secret to being a great DM is to surround yourself great players. Even the best improvisational DM in the world won't be able to sustain a campaign if he or she is running a game for a bunch of doorknobs.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a Dungeon Master decides to run a D&amp;D game, he or she enters a social contract with the players at the table. Under the terms of this social contract, the DM agrees to run the best adventure he or she can and give the players the freedom to make real choices. Meanwhile, the players must acknowledge that the DM has invested a significant amount of time preparing the adventure, and while some distractions from the main plot are acceptable, there may be occasions when the DM needs the players' help to get the adventure back on track. Players who ignore this social contract, who ignore the DM's subtle hints or deliberately resist the DM's attempts to run the adventure at hand, can make the DM's experience quite miserable. And when the DM is miserable, nobody is having fun. On the other hand, great players can inspire the DM, as well as provide fuel for future adventures in the campaign."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91376/#Comment_91376" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-29T13:17:13+00:00" title="August 29, 2007  1:17PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Justin D.

That, and Perkins is nose-deep in D&amp;D 24-7 at a fairly high level, for quite some time now, so it doesn't surprise me that D&amp;D is basically his world.<br/><br/>And the "rails" comment (at least as presented in Perkin's blog) is, honestly, pretty accurate when you're talking about the typical published D&amp;D module. The basic D&amp;D "social contract" is pretty much all about not being the dickweed who refuses to do anything covered by the pre-written content the DM is using. It's the mark of a quality D&amp;D module when this content allows for maximum freedom within the overall "mission". I'm kind of hoping that the increased ease-of-use being advertised for 4e will facilitate the DMs ability to ignore the rails more and more.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, it's somewhat disheartening to see someone so prominent in D&amp;D's existence still think like this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91405/#Comment_91405" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-29T14:03:51+00:00" title="August 29, 2007  2:03PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2007 2:26PM by Anemone.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [cynical mode on]<br/>In any case, people have to realize that WotC likely plopped a lot of money on PAX, and therefore bought itself some quasi-ad space.  Two weeks before, they had donated a considerable amount in merchandise for a much smaller local convention; my guess is their participation at PAX must have been ten times that much or more.  So if they want to own "the future of tabletop roleplaying" at the panel, hey, who's going to tell them that no, they have to share equally with the folks who are happy when they sell 300 copies of their games?  Good luck with that.<br/><br/>Maybe it's not worded or even thought of that way, but in practical terms, it comes down to the same thing.<br/>[/cynical mode off]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91408/#Comment_91408" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-29T14:09:25+00:00" title="August 29, 2007  2:09PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know about PAX, but pretty much every convention setting I've been in has involved companies giving seminars titled things like "The Future of ___" and "Evolutionary ___ and You." Of those, at least 80% have been commercials. Of the ones being hosted by a major player in the industry, 100% have been commercials.

If I got up there and said that BW was the future of the hobby and spoke only of Burning Wheel it would not be cool. <br/><br/>Chris,<br/>I hope we weren't too obnoxious. Honestly, I felt a little bad for you up there. You've published all sorts of games that are not DnD, something that your copanelist wasn't too gracious about. We just wanted to mix it up and bit and take a broader view. Certainly, DnD is a big part of the future of both hobby and industry, but I think there's a lot more to it. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Oh, and they both answered a with a "Yes, yes we have..." Both panelists seemed a little surprised and I thought I detected an inward groan or two.<br/><br/>-L                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pramas" title="Pramas"><img alt="Pramas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pramas">Pramas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91429/#Comment_91429" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-29T15:27:17+00:00" title="August 29, 2007  3:27PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The panel was odd, but I guess I expected it to be worse. I have no idea what the original moderator intended, and since whoever that was didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t show up it was up to Chris and I to improvise. After GenCon I thought the entire thing was going to devolve into a \xe2\u20ac\u0153tell us about 4E\xe2\u20ac\x9d panel. I was glad I had the opportunity to talk about some other stuff.  I did not mind Luke and Jared throwing a few bombs, because we were making it up as we went along anyway. <br/>\n<br/>\nChris is really gung ho for D&amp;D but I wouldn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t dismiss him as a corporate shill. He loves that game and always has, which is how he ended up down in Renton in the first place. The WotC offices, at least when I was there, tended to be a bit insular. I remember getting into this conversation the first month I was there (this was pre-3E) with one of the editors. He said to me with a straight face that D&amp;D was the best selling RPG because it was the best game. I didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t even know how to respond to that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chadu" title="chadu"><img alt="chadu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/chadu/pic/0003ch8e"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chadu">chadu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91457/#Comment_91457" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-29T18:41:07+00:00" title="August 29, 2007  6:41PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Anemone</cite>Funny, if I'm picturing this tone right, I don't hear it much from gamers? but I do hear it a<b>lot</b>from teenagers and young adults on the bus?

My answer went something like this: A great Dungeon Master is a master of improv, which is to say that when the adventure runs off the rails, the great DM can "go with the flow" and improvise to keep the game interesting and fun for the players. However, a great DM also knows how to get the game group back on the rails. Sometimes this means presenting an illusion of choice, but knowing full well how the players are likely to respond, whereby the DM prods the players so gently in the right direction that the players think they're still masters of their own fate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was horrified when the young man who asked the question resented the idea that the DM would railroad the party in such a manner. On the drive home after the seminar, I thought about my response, as well as my own DM-ing experiences. Was I wrong? Did the young man misunderstand me? Then it occurred to me that my answer my incomplete, that I'd failed to mention something crucial: The true secret to being a great DM is to surround yourself great players.

I'll leave it to Luke to decide if it's pertinent to this thread or not, but I think it could suffice to say the following: There are functional versions of the style of play that WOTC guy is delineating that don't fall into some people's definitions of railroading (despite his use of the term "rails"). The question for this thread should probably be something like whether or not we ought to be dismayed by the fact that there's a segment who portrays this methodology as the only way to play. Or whether Chris is right/justified in saying that the "alternative" methods that we use are only suitable for a certain segment of people. <br/>\n<br/>\n(If you're interested in more on railroading, search up previous discussions here and at the Forge for people's thoughts. If there's more to say about it, perhaps a new thread?)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn that subject, on the one hand, I want to agree with the posters who are dismayed. Meaning that I,too, feel that these RPGs are potentially enjoyable for anyone who enjoys RPGs. On the other hand, I couldn't disagree that people have their own proclivities and preferences, and that not everyone will end up playing "storygames." The only question I'd have is whether Chris' rhetoric, or rhetoric from others like it, are preventing anyone from trying out other sorts of games. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne side of me wants to say that it's a tempest in a tea-kettle. Another says that it's this sort of thinking that allows people in the USA to sub-consciously keep minorities from having the same opportunities as white Americans. It's the "PC" issue. I'm quite sure that Chris has no malice in his heart when he says this. And given the size of the audience, I'm pretty sure that this single act did little direct "damage." But such comments might be part of an overall culture that works to prevent people from trying new things. The subtext, intended or not, is like, "These games are hard, and flakey experimentalism, in which you're going to have to put a lot of work in to only occasionally get some fun... and that's only if you're into such hard work." Which couldn't be further from the truth. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is part of me, too, that says, "Who cares?" It's not like we're talking about some actual minority being damaged here. We're talking about people not being exposed to certain games, or being prevented from doing so. At worst this causes some small economic damage to those designers. Which, in a capitalist society is all fair, no? <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, not saying that Chris is intentionally vying against "indie" games or something. Just that this may be the end result. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91552/#Comment_91552" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T06:07:22+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  6:07AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "The question for this thread should probably be something like whether or not we ought to be dismayed by the fact that there's a segment who portrays this methodology as the only way to play."<br/>\n<br/>\nYes. I am dismayed. I don't care if there are people who actually enjoy doing that. That's fine. But when these people try to tell the world that this is THE way to play.... dismay!<br/>\n<br/>\n" Or whether Chris is right/justified in saying that the "alternative" methods that we use are only suitable for a certain segment of people."<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is certainly true as well, in the sense that this segment is everybody but Chris and people who enjoy playing like that. I mean, that's really what it is. Chrisites (for lack of a better term?) prefer "classic" play. So be it. Everyone should be able to find the kind of playstyle that they enjoy. That doesn't mean that given the choice between "classic" and many other playstyles that everyone is going to wnat to choose classic. I suspect that if every gamer had a chance to experience 5 or 6 different playstyles, "classic" would end up being a very small segment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect this is one of the reasons that, as well as it has done, D&amp;D hasn't ever caught on in the true mainstream. Passive participation is fine with tv or movies, but games and creative collaberative storytelling both encourage moreparticipation and input from all participants then D&amp;D really allows.<br/>\n<br/>\n"The only question I'd have is whether Chris' rhetoric, or rhetoric from others like it, are preventing anyone from trying out other sorts of games. "<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd say yes, even if it isn't intentional on Chris' part. I've met enough people who won't play a story game because "so and so said story games aren't really rpgs" to believe that this kind of rhetoric does lead to people not trying games that they might otherwise enjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\n"But such comments might be part of an overall culture that works to prevent people from trying new things:<br/>\n<br/>\nYes. Shit like this has kept me from trying a lot of things that I later ended up enjoying.

I talked at the panel about how, in my opinion, the GM's job was to find out what kind of experience the players want to have and then make sure they got it. If the group wants to push the boundaries of roleplaying and get all experimental, awesome. If the group wants to have an old fashioned dungeon crawl, why can't that be awesome too?<br/><br/>I've thought about this, and I really just want to put my $0.02 in:<br/><br/>1. I find that quote by Green Ronin-Chris not disheartening, but outright annoying.  Frustrating.<br/><br/>Almost every RPG I've ever read (and I'm almost certain there are a couple Green Ronin games in there), has that little "What is Roleplaying?" and "Why Roleplaying?" section in front.  And almost every one of them goes through the standard rigmarole involving "Let's Pretend" and "Cowboy" and "Bang Bang, You're Dead"/"No I'm not!" etc. etc.<br/><br/>And a lot of them (the 2nd edition of V:tM particularly sticks out in my mind) bemoan the fact that mankind as a whole has lost his story-telling nature.  That modern media is all about consumption and not production, about passive experience and not active creation.<br/><br/>And now Green Ronin-Chris is saying that most people want to show up and be entertained?  Excuse me?<br/><br/>Dear god, no wonder I started hating DMing back in my D&amp;D days.  By his definition, I was a dancing bear, for chrissakes.<br/><br/>Isn't this wanting to have your cake and eat it to?  How can your RPG be all about <b>playing together</b>, but you expect that most of the players simply want to show up and sit passively?  Why aren't you all watching a movie instead?<br/><br/>Better yet: why aren't you taking them to an improv show?  It sounds like what they want is to give a couple suggestions at the opening ("Do a story about a Rogue and a Fighter who want revenge on a Magic-User!") and then sit back and watch.<br/><br/>And I know that not everyone's equally creative.  But we all have our strengths.  I've know RPGers who couldn't come up with a background to save their lives, but can do an accent or a posture positively <b>overflowing</b> with character.  Maybe that's another job of the GM?<br/><br/>Finally, there's something to be said for the Pygmalion effect, I think.  If you expect nothing more of your players than their sitting there like sacks of potatoes, well, I think you get what you deserve, there.<br/><br/>2. Re: Pramas' response: I don't think my issue is about people having fun in a different way.  Absolutely, it's the GM's job to find out what kind of experience the players want to have.  But if the players want to sit and be entertained, then why on earth are you roleplaying?  Do stand up comedy.  Read poetry at them.  Show movies.  But why on earth are you pulling people who want to sit there and do nothing into an activity that is by its very nature creative and proactive?<br/><br/>And I don't understand the connection between 'Ye Olde Dungeon Crawl' and passivity.  I'm involved in a dungeon crawl right now and it's nothing but action, action, action.  We're up and moving and DOING things.  Is it all about deeply investigating the very core of our character's souls?  Hell no!  But we're not sitting there waiting for the GM to give us the next 'adventure hook'.  He's throwing out stuff, sure, and we're throwing stuff back at him.  Isn't that the point?<br/><br/>I'm reminded a source book put out for Unknown Armies called One Shots, and in one of them, the author had a piece of advice.  He suggested the GM write out a message on a piece of paper and keep it handy.  Whenever it was necessary, he should hand it to a player.<br/><br/>The message was: "Bored?  DO SOMETHING."<br/><br/>I'm not trying to be confrontational here.  I'm trying to wrap my head around the idea of someone who's passionately part of a hobby that's all about creativity who expects his fellow hobbyists to be passive participants.<br/><br/>-d-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91573/#Comment_91573" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T07:20:11+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  7:20AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2007 7:24AM by Andy.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: SabreCat</cite>I did notice you mentioned the small-press, PDF and POD explosion a great deal, and even gave a couple shouts out to Burning Wheel.

The panel was created by a panel moderator.<br/><br/>The panel moderator had some idea, rubbing his hands together, when he booked the panel. He was going somewhere with all this, doing something with it.<br/><br/>Then the panel moderator didn't show up. The Chrisses showed up, kinda wondering what they were supposed to do. There was no backup moderator, no one in the know who could fill in for the moderator and, y'know, move the discussion in whatever way it was supposed to have gone.<br/><br/>So they did the best with what they had. They could have said, "Fuck it, let's go get sandwiches" and left. <br/><br/>Seriously, think about this: Someone says, "Hey, I'm throwing a party at my place. I want you and Jennifer to come. Make sure you bring at least THREE religious artifacts. And come dressed as Godzilla and Mothra. You HAVE to do this. It's going to be SO AWESOME." <br/><br/>So you do so. You show up dressed as Mothra, Jennifer is there as Godzilla, and between you you have 6 religious artifacts, including Buddhist prayer beads, bible, Torah, Koran, etc. You get to the party, and NO ONE ELSE IS DRESSED UP. They are looking at you, expectantly.  And the fucker who told you to show up with all this crazy shit bailed on you, no one can find him.  What do you do?<br/><br/>(Plus, given that it's PAX, to continue the metaphor: All the people at the Party essentially came not to see you and Jennifer give your Godzilla-Mothra-Religion speech, but to play Starcraft II.

The author of One-Shots was, I think, Greg Stolze (there may have been multiple authors). In any case, while I understand the sentiment of his "Bored" messages, my response would be to suggest that, perhaps, the system being used wasn't prompting the sorts of behaviors that we're looking for. Players are human beings, and will have a tendecy to be passive for some in some cases. I used to blame my players, until I realized that I wasn't incentivizing them to do anything different than what they were doing. Yeah, you can hope that your players will be terrifically proactive, but that's not nearly as fecund a method of getting them to be so than having a system that rewards such activity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91585/#Comment_91585" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T07:49:41+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  7:49AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wasn't saying kid gloves at all, Mike.<br/><br/>I'm all for disagreeing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91593/#Comment_91593" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T07:59:34+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  7:59AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>We should treat Chris like anyone else who arrived in the forum for the first time and no different.</blockquote>\nI thought that is what everyone was doing <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Hi Chris, welcome to SG.

As a person who's been on the business end of that kind of perception, I'd say that you're probably wrong.  I have been on both sides of enthusiasm:  forcing enthusiasm for database programs as a consultant, and channelling genuine enthusiasm for RPGs.<br/><br/>I found forcing enthusiasm to be one of the most exhausting things a human being can do (actual physical combat and sprint running are <b>slightly</b> more tiring, but only slightly).  I'm amazed by people who can keep it up for a half-hour meeting.  I've <b><i>never</i></b> seen (nor do I expect to see) someone who can keep it up indefinitely.  If you see someone consistently being wildly enthusiastic then you can pretty much be assured that they're genuine.

My players have no interest in doing any "heavy lifting". That's my job, as far as they're concerned, and most of the time I relish it. Sometimes it sucks, e.g., when I'm short on time and long on prepwork. Times like that I really want to get my players onto Agon or some such. But most of the time, our dynamic yields a ton of fun across the board.

Dude's job is to make D&amp;D4 -- his perspective is that the future of gaming is in D&amp;D. For most of the people there at that panel -- general-purpose game hobbyists who play D&amp;D the "classic" way -- his answers about what makes a good GM is pretty spot-on. (A lot of it is pretty accurate for almost any trad-game, "surround yourself with great players" especially.) I can go to SG or just, y'know, ask people directly (indie designers are very accessible!) if I want to know where the future of the hobby is in indie publishing -- so I'll admit I was actually more interested in what the WotC guy had to say about D&amp;D specifically.<br/><br/>The problem is that, pretty much like every panel I went to at PAX, they did a lousy job of picking people. Most of the panels were the same kind of thing -- two guys who have one perspective, third guy who has a somewhat but not completely different perspective, HUGE segment of the field completely unrepresented. It definitely would've been better if they'd let Luke moderate, I imagine, or if whoever had put it together in the first place had asked someone with an indie perspective to sit on the panel so we could've gotten some back-and-forth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91961/#Comment_91961" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T20:22:07+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  8:22PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>The true secret to being a great DM is to surround yourself great players.</blockquote>\nThis is seriously the lamest thing I have heard all week... and I work in educational publishing.<br/><br/>I don't know, seems like a fairly good rendition of "the secret to good managing is surrounding yourself with good employees" in RPG terms.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack" title="amnesiack"><img alt="amnesiack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1012/830711303_f5d26761f6_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack">amnesiack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92351/#Comment_92351" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T17:08:31+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  5:08PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2007 5:09PM by amnesiack.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Anemone</cite>Heh.

It may be big (though it started as a local gaming con with a few hundred people), but it is not an industry show.  It's a festival put on by gamers so that other gamers (of all stripes) can come and play games, and, in the process, maybe see a few things that normally only people in "the industry" get to see.  As someone who has worked his butt off for the last four years as a volunteer at the event, seen it grow, and interacted extensively with the organizers, I strongly resent the what you're saying here, particularly if you're judging completely from the outside.  Story Games may not be well represented (yet, I'm working on that, having introduced Luke and Jarod to one of the con organizers this past week), but PAX is hardly what you're painting it to be here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92371/#Comment_92371" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T19:18:13+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  7:18PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: amnesiack</cite>I strongly resent the what you're saying here[..]</blockquote>\nI'm terribly sorry, no offense was meant.
