Then again sometimes we attack aliens on their world... But it's all a battle for conquering the galaxy kind of mess. What if instead we were being harvested, kind of like War of the Worlds. Except honestly, it'd seem like a waste of resources to travel all of the way to our world. What if they just transported our world to theirs? What if they aren't even of this galaxy or hey, lets make it easier and say we don't even know if they're of this dimension. We don't know. What if they did this with multiple worlds, hundreds of times before? Constantly absorbing new technologies and worlds, growing like a interplanetary roman empire." This is what started my brainstorm for this game.<br/><br/>Essentially it's a table top RPG game that stages itself on the Earth of today getting pulled into somewhere else in space, maybe even a new dimension, where there are hundreds of other worlds all even closer than how close our moon is to us. A sky that is instead of being filled with stars, is filled with other worlds and limitless possibilities of game play. So back to the main story, our world is sucked into this other dimension and our world is immediately thrown into chaos. Our world phasing into this new place has opened a new awareness in many humans, driving some mad, and driving others to delve in new forms of psychically channeled magiks. <br/><br/>The race of aliens who brought our world here however, didn't intend to give us new gifts, but instead use us and our technology to grow their empire and increase their society. They are a highly psychic oriented race and cannot reproduce on their own. Thus needed new minds subjected to their training and put into a new mechanical body that would suit the society's purpose for their new role. We're next on their list, and currently the largest outstanding threat besides this alien empire is a strange menace that absorbs all light. An indescribable race of shadowy horror. It's unknown how this race became mixed up in these events... maybe the alien empire just chose the wrong world which their psychic world teleportation affected in unknown ways. Whatever the reason, this foe is mindless and it is powerful.<br/><br/>So now you have earth, who is now being invaded by body snatchers to fuel the armies of the alien empire against the 'shadows' while at the same time shadows begin to infect our world as well. Those who haven't been driven insane by the powerful psychics of the planetary teleportation or infected into some monster by the shadows now can begin to grow on with their own abilities to affect the world as they choose. Will you stand to try and save the world? Maybe even return it to it's rightful place in the Milky Way? Or will you side with the shadows or aliens, trading power for your mind. Or perhaps you'll just leave the world to rot to go and explore the new worlds out there, maybe even find other worlds that have survivors in a similar situation such as Earth. What ever your choice you have the opportunity to have countless stories in this new universe.<br/><br/><br/>So, that's the basic outline of the story. There will be of course all sorts of technologies, worlds, and sample races that you can find or create/add your own.<br/><br/>I have the character sheet and skill set written up and they system is based on a 1 through 20 scale where 6 is an average difficulty and 20 is impossible. The better you are at a skill, the higher the die value you'll use to represent how well you do in that skill, in addition to any natural ability you have such as raw strength or intellect. I've also got most of the rules down and I'm still tweaking them to fix the game. At the moment my biggest project is working on the classes (known as paths in this game) that will be the primary focus of how your powers manifest. The game itself is supposed to be centered around character and world building, but I have yet to do any serious play tests due to the fact I still need to finish writing more paths to successfully do that. My big question is does this sound like something you'd be interested in playing?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
