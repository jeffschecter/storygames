A game has both fictional narrative and meta-game narrative.  Both of these are part of the experience.</blockquote>Yes, they are, but a role-playing game without any fiction would be quite aimless. The fiction is indeed the aim of "it all" (read that as "the game", if you like). People may have other goals in their gaming (getting laid, meeting friends, etc.), but that is outside the realm of the game, as such.<br/><br/>Please explain your "meta-game narrative", and how it may be said to be an aim of<i>the game</i>. I do realize that a designer want his game to be played in specific ways, and that may be a design-goal for him. Playing the game in a specific way is still not the aim of the game. The game is always directed towards the fiction;<br/>- How do we produce it?<br/>- What will it be?<br/>- How will it engage us?<br/>It is important to your understanding of role-playing games, jhkim, that you realize the fact that such games are really<i>aimed at the fiction</i>. There is no way around this. As an arrow seeks out its target, an rpg seeks out its fiction. It may miss, but that is besides the point. (lol)<br/><br/>Of course; we have to be open to the possibility that someone may want to design a game of purpose beyond the fiction. Say: you may want to design a game that gets all the players laid, for real. Someone would surely play it ... ;-)<br/>I'm going to offer two hypothetical but common cases to compare: <br/><br/>1) The GM invokes her authority and narrates how a particular conflict goes down.  <br/><br/>2) The players compete by a hand of cards in the meta-game, and the winner of this narrates how a particular conflict goes down.  <br/><br/>In both of these hypothetical cases, the fictional result is <i>identical</i>.  i.e. The exact same words are spoken with the same intonation to describe what happens in the game world.  However, the meta-game experience is vastly different.  <br/><br/>In general, for players the experience of play is not just the fiction that results - but also <i>how that fiction came about</i>.  There is a level of game-play beyond what is in the fiction - what I would call the "meta-game" (i.e. which player narrates this result) as opposed to the "out of game" (i.e. will I get laid after the game).  I'll leave this at that for the moment.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309433/#Comment_309433" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-24T22:54:49+00:00" title="January 24, 2011 10:54PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>In general, for players the experience of play is not just the fiction that results - but also<i>how that fiction came about</i>.

Those days are gone, as we all know, but I do believe that role-playing can be as fun again, as in those days. We only have to work out better principles of play, which will make us set aside our consciousness of the game as a technical procedure.

I'm at the table because the process of participating in the game is fun.  That these happen to be games which produce stories is almost negligible: the fact is, I can get better fiction elsewhere, faster and more easily.  (Judging from the AP reports I've read, so can most people!)<br/><br/>So to get my gaming dollar and four hours of my time every weekend, a game probably shouldn't be aimed exclusively at "the fiction."  It should be aimed at <i>being fun to participate in.</i>  If it happens to be a game about making up a story with my friends, that's fine; being good at that will certainly be a plus. That just can't be the ONLY thing the game does right, because a game that isn't fun but produces great stories simply isn't worth my time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309454/#Comment_309454" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-25T02:04:24+00:00" title="January 25, 2011  2:04AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's both. <br/>We are at the table because<i> the process of creating fiction together</i> is fun.<br/><br/> If it wasn't for the fiction, we'd be playing a boardgame (which we often do), if it wasn't for the participation we'd watch a movie (which we also often do).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_309458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309458/#Comment_309458" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-25T04:17:52+00:00" title="January 25, 2011  4:17AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Suna</cite>If the aim is the fiction, why not writing a novel?</blockquote>Dastardly Tazio went forth with his sharp questionnaire!

You're redefining "fiction" to include the metagame like players' moods and interactions - but that's not how most people understand the term.

The point is that the kind of fiction we make in a role-playing game is much more of an internal than what you get from other sources. Much of the "narrative" is never narrated. It takes place in the head and body of the player. We have to recognize these qualities of the fiction, to fully understand how deeply a role-playing game can touch us.<br/><br/>---&gt; No, I have not said the players interaction is part of the fiction.<br/><br/>As for "how most people understand the term"; we have a tradition to be proud of, in role-playing games ranging from <i>D&amp;D</i> to <i>Until We Sink ..</i>., but the traditional understanding of this form is, and will always be, a bit behind the understanding reached by designers, and others, ready to challenge their beliefs in what a role-playing game is, or could be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_309473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309473/#Comment_309473" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-25T07:11:10+00:00" title="January 25, 2011  7:11AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 25, 2011 7:11AM by TomasHVM.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>When you talk about the goals of an RPG separate from the players, what are you talking about?</blockquote>Am I?<br/><br/>I am talking about the aim of <i>the game</i>, and included in the game are players to play it.

When you create feelings and moods to enhance/deepen/accentuate the fiction, those moods are also part of the fiction. "The fiction" is not limited to the words we use to describe the dealings of the characters. It also includes our full experience of said dealings, including the moods we create as we narrate them. The home of the fiction is our own body and soul.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>This is a pretty weird way of looking at the problem and, I think, builds in an obfuscating synecdoche. When I read a book, the fiction <em>induces</em> moods in me. If you could include the mood in the fiction directly, that would mean that there would be no reason to produce the art at all. That's direct, memeless brain control.</p>\n<p>In an RPG, you have words (gestures, voices, maps...) that represent the fiction. They tell us what happens. (Procedures tell the fiction what happens, but that's not part of this discussion.) When we design a game and play it, we're looking to give each other analogous experiences of the fiction. We can't have a perfect shared vision because of the nature of the reality, enhanced by the description-based nature of the RPG medium. But we shoot for an analogous experience of imaginary things.</p>\n<p>What we <em>don't</em> assume is that we have the same emotional reaction to the events. Sometimes we agree, sometimes we don't. I think a character is a psychopath, Rob thinks I'm mad at him because he was mean to my character once.</p>\n<p>Our interpretation, our emotional experience, of fictional elements is our own because <em>that's what's fun</em>.</p>\n<p>Now, I don't know about a game that effectively includes the players' emotions in the game, but I doubt it's impossible. You'd have to include it in the feedback loop somehow. I know that Misspent Youth requires you to do things that make you feel bad when you sell out your character, and if you poll your fellow players when you don't have an idea, you might find yourself sharing a fictional emotional state with everyone else at the table. But it's not complete (for good reason, I think), and it's the only game I know that does that.</p>\n<p>Thomas, I think I see what you're after: you're looking to expand "fiction" to mean "everything you sense about the game" the way the Forge expanded "system" to mean "everything you do to make the game happen," but "System" is subdivided into a bunch of neat subcategories: Techniques, Creative Agenda, &amp; Social Agenda, off the top of my head. If you wanted to do that to "fiction", you need to a) determine where the distinctions are interesting, and b) believe that the Forge's particular system of terms is inherently valuable.</p>\n<p>I, for one, think that there's no reason to emulate the Forge's system of terminology. Use it? Sure. We've managed to cobble together some understanding using those terms. But better terms (and a better structure for the model) would have benefitted us all. No reason to keep using that infrastructure.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_309485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309485/#Comment_309485" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-25T07:47:41+00:00" title="January 25, 2011  7:47AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 25, 2011 8:08AM by TomasHVM.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

And so, in interaction, you induce yourself, and your fellow players, with emotions. All the more reason to do it!<br/><br/>I feel obliged to say that I consider <i>the fiction</i> something else than <i>the setting</i>. The setting is merely a tool to inspire the fiction.<br/><br/>In the same way; when we are said to "build a character" for the game, we are really building an abstract framework which we hope will inspire the real character. Your actual <i>character</i> is created in interaction with the other players, with their character-actions and relations, and your manipulations of the fictional universe.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

I'm trying to open my eyes to what the fiction of a role-playing game really is. I've had experiences with role-playing games which are impossible in other media. The fiction of a role-playing game have the potential to be something completely different than what you get in a novel, a movie, or whatnot. There is reason players get a certain gleam in their eyes, talking of "a magical game-session". It's something filled with unique qualities. These unique qualities are present in all role-playing games, in different amounts, from <i>Warhammer</i> to <i>Itras By</i> to <i>Stoke Birmingham 0-0</i>. I'm talking of the special magic at work between the players in their interaction; the magic that creates a fiction filled with emotions and tension, and the joy of an unpredictable co-creation.<br/><br/>I'm not expanding anything. Compared to the complexity of fiction created by a role-playing game, and the potential of this fiction to captivate, challenge and change us, I'm merely trying to hint at it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309522/#Comment_309522" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-25T10:46:03+00:00" title="January 25, 2011 10:46AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>In general, for players the experience of play is not just the fiction that results - but also<i>how that fiction came about</i>.</blockquote>\nI can't find the quote now, but I once read something along the lines -<br/><br/>We love our children far more than other people's children, and this is especially true when the children are ideas.<br/><br/>(If anybody knows the original correct quote let me know; it's become kind of a mantra for me.)<br/><br/>So, yeah - and this may be a failing in the human psyche - but when a GM says "And the orcs of this tribe love to crochet" I don't care, but when *I* say "And the orcs of this tribe love to crochet" it's gaming gold.

Feel like a creative genius, and help your friends feel the same!"<br/>2) the game's rules have been designed specifically to support that, with taste questionnaires, and other metagame procedures baked into the process of narrating fiction (he with most fanmail gets to narrate, e.g.)<br/><br/>To look at that game and state that (a) and not (b) was "the point of the game"?

The fact is that the interaction still is geared towards fiction. The promise that you will feel like a genius playing the game do not interfere with this. If the game-designer is right, you will be all the more happy with the fiction created.

Without this aim the game would lack direction, and the interaction would be just something we did with no purpose to it.

Aim is fairly synonymous with goal.  If the goal of Monopoly is to produce a winner, why not just spin a top, and whoever it points at is the winner?  This is the same distinction as between Task and Intent in Burning Wheel.  The Task of cooking does create food, but your Intent may be to impress someone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309601/#Comment_309601" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-25T18:29:58+00:00" title="January 25, 2011  6:29PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like playing in someone else's world, but seeing how we the group change it, make it our own.

It is part of the method.<br/><br/>However; the players being nervous for their mechanical resources, could lend force to the emotional content of their game-play. The nervousness could be connected to how the characters felt, or it could induce other feelings connected to the characters. Either way the nervousness would be a key to more acute fiction, as I imagine it really was too, in your game. Feelings which originates in the interaction, feeds back into it, making the whole experience even more heartfelt. The relationship between interaction and fiction is a dynamic one. Many elements of our game may be said to exist in both, and any "borders" between the two are always shifting. Keep that in mind.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>2) Another choice might be The Shab-al-Hiri Roach, where one feature is that there is a rule declaring one player the meta-game winner.

It is what we <i>create</i> when playing; the final product. But please keep in mind that this "creation" may feed back into our game-play, as in; great game-play in one player, may inspire great game-play in others. Interaction is all about playing into the hands of each other, in an uplifting spiral towards engaging fiction. Great games makes this simple for all players.<br/><br/>I know having a new set of terms thrown at you may be confusing. That is how it is. Nothing I can do about that, except being as patient I can, trying to clarify. I am trying, but please; if you really want to understand; go back to the original thread, and read my post on the whle set of terms.

It does nothing to elevate the experience of the interaction. <br/><br/>Seems to me you (and others) are under the misguided belief that we are trying to establish a hierarchy here. I am not. The point of having the fiction as the end-goal, is not to make it the only part of the role-playing game we can enjoy. All of us have had great experiences interacting with others.

Could you describe<b>what's to be gained by using the language you're using</b>to talk about roleplaying?  Please?</blockquote>What I've gained is a lot more clarity. <br/><br/>As a designer I've gained a simple map that shows the true direction when designing role-playing games. It helps a lot.<br/><br/>The three-steps: <i>vision - interaction - fiction</i> ... makes is abundantly clear to me that ...<br/>- my work as a designer is in the vision-part<br/>- the players gaming takes place in the interaction-part (and thus interaction is at the heart of any role-playing game)<br/>- and the design has to be directed at the fiction-part in some way<br/><br/>The use of <i>method</i> has made it clear a role-playing game is more than <i>mechanics</i>. The <i>techniques</i> (storytelling and dialogue) are a field worthy of design-endeavours (very important, and largely ignored by lots of designers). It is necessary to investigate how your game is played, in full, and to plan for, and "tool up", the full game-play, if your design is to be effective. If I want my game to be largely dependent on mechanical tools, or technical ones, it should be a conscious choice of design, not solely a deference to tradition.<br/><br/>The use of <i>setting</i>, as a part of the game outside the fiction, has made it clear that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the setting is a tool within the method</span>, purposed to  frame the interaction, and to inspire the content of fiction.<br/><br/>The whole of it has provided me with a much sought after apparatus of thought, both clear and challenging in its simplicity. It has "tidied up my mind" on role-playing games, so to say.

So; if the first word; <i>opplevelse</i>, is the player "viewing" the game, and the second word; <i>erfaring</i>, is the player "experiencing" the game ... <br/>- then I would say that <i>viewing</i> the game becomes an <i>experience</i> the moment you realize that the game is engaging and changing you in some profound way.

It is too simple to call it a narrative, actually, as long as we do not narrate to an audience. We are "narrating" to ourselves, and that means that we are able to include wordless content to our fiction; elements that may never be narrated, but which are indeed experienced as part of the fiction.<br/><br/><b>An example of play:</b><br/><i>Mary plays a soldier. The army is attacking a village at night, burning and killing. The fight develops into a chaos, and the GM stresses the players by throwing a series of tough situations at them, demanding immediate choices, and giving immediate consequences of brutal nature. No die is rolled; this is game-play based totally on effective dialogue-tools (the methodic field of techniques). The churning chaos of scenes are designed to make Mary feel a simile to what a soldier in the field of such a battle may feel. And she do get a taste of fear and anger, and feels some kind of survival mode kicking in. When the battle is over, and the GM lets the players lean back in a reflective scene, the player Mary is mentally exhausted, but manages to make use of that to play through the silent despair after battle.</i><br/><br/>Mari described her feelings and reactions to me after the game, both under the battle and after, and went on to tell me she did not know role-playing games could feel like that. She'd only played D&amp;D before, with her group of friends.<br/><br/>The emotional response is indeed part of the fiction; in this example the players (the other felt it too) managed to feel for themselves what the soldiers they played went through, emotionally. No feelings as such were "narrated", but they were induced and indeed <i>felt</i>, and they were very much a part of the fiction. <br/><br/>Immersion is all about walking in the shoes of your character, in any way possible that is not damaging to you, the player. The latent potential for immersion in dialogue-based role-playing games is great. I believe we have only just begun to tap into it. Going further is only a matter of time ...<br/><br/>And with that "bombshell" I conclude this debate for my part. Thank you very much for your efforts to understand, in spite of my alien viewpoints on our games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309804/#Comment_309804" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-26T16:09:30+00:00" title="January 26, 2011  4:09PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 26, 2011 4:10PM by timonkey.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I totally agree about your point on emotional response.  The fiction is integral to having it.  I also agree that some things in the fiction aren't said.  It's more than just the Shared Imagined Space, it's also what we imagine in our own minds.  We may have somewhat different fictions even though we're playing in the same game.<br/><br/>But calling anything that isn't fictional "fiction" ... I want to say "is stupid", but I don't want to be insulting.  I'm tempted to say something dramatic like: "will lead to the fall of civilization as we abandon the common meaning of words which allow us to operate as a civilized society".  Perhaps I should resign myself to accept this as a lost cause.<br/><br/>It's not your viewpoints that are alien, it's your terminology.  Perhaps that is the issue, you are an alien to me (as in from another country).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
