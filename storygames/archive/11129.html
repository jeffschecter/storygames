For those who don't know what <i>Necromunda</i> is, here's a bit from the <a href="http://www.games-workshop.com/gws/catalog/landingArmy.jsp?catId=cat200210&amp;rootCatGameStyle=specialist-games" rel="nofollow">official site</a>:\n<blockquote>Necromunda is a game of fierce combat between rival gang fighters in the dangerous underworld of the Necromundan hives: ancient and incomprehensibly vast cities, built up layer upon layer, stretching ten miles into a planet's atmosphere. To those who live in the depths, the dark and ruinous Underhive offers every opportunity for wealth and power. Its collapsed caverns conceal the riches of the distant past: rare and precious metals, unfathomable archeotech devices, wondrous mutated fungi and much more. It is also a place of danger, where mutant creatures, renegades and killers hide from the laws of House and hive. </blockquote>\nTo put things another way, <i>Necromunda</i> is as dystopic as your average apocalyptic tale, just minus the mushroom clouds.<br/><br/>After a little talking on that other thread about how to map the various character types to the setting \u2014 which is very easy, it turns out \u2014 I started thinking seriously about running this thing.  Which led me into considerations of how to prep.<br/><br/>Because it has its origins as a wargame, albeit a small scale one, there's a lot of emphasis in the official <i>Necromunda</i> materials on weapons.  <i>Apocalypse World</i> doesn't do much with weapons and generally keeps the power level down, which I'm all for.  But one of the first questions I'm grappling with is whether I want to create replacement weapons for those listed in the character booklets or just leave them be and just call them by different, <i>Necromunda</i>-specific names.<br/><br/>Beyond weapons, what else do I need to consider?  Like I said, the character types work perfectly well in the new setting, so I don't think I'll need to disallow anything.  We've even got an explanation for the psychic maelstrom: it's now become exposure to Warp and an invitation to Warp-taint.  But surely I'm missing something.  It can't be that easy.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247099/#Comment_247099" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-16T10:59:01+00:00" title="December 16, 2009 10:59AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We did Necromunda with PTA and it was awesome.

I think there needs to be some way to reconcile the fact that AW and Necromunda have different conceptions of how violence works. Just a thought.<br/><br/>In AW, there is no differentiation between close combat and shooting, aside from weapon choice. In Necromunda, entire gangs take their sense of identity from this distinction. Thoughts?<br/><br/>The Skinner totally doesn't seem viable in Necromunda.<br/><br/>You can construct most of the weapons in Necromunda with the weapons tags that exist in AW.

They're already included in AW, but they only have a narrative effect. Could be as simple as a basic range bracket system (like 3:16 level of detail) where you can't attack someone outside of your weapons optimal range. Oh, and change pistols from "close" to "close/hand" to keep them in line with their behavior in Necromunda.<br/><br/>"Power weapon" is just the ap tag on a hand to hand weapon, and I'm not sure plasma needs to activate on a specific roll. One of the GM's moves is already "activate their stuff's downside" and exploding is a pretty harsh downside.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247188/#Comment_247188" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-16T15:44:04+00:00" title="December 16, 2009  3:44PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: FigureFour</cite>Presumably there's more to life in the Underhive than constant gang warfare, right?</blockquote>\nIn the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war.<br/><br/>Only.

But it also seems to miss the point. If I were playing a game in the Necromunda setting and wasn't engaging in a lot of actual fighting, I'd feel disconnected from the source material. I don't recall ever seeing a Necromunda picture where the person wasn't armed and armored, and most are in "battle poses".<br/><br/>Sure, we want to "broaden the scope" to make it more Apocalypse-World-y. If you have a Hard-holder, focus more on house politics. If you have a Savvy-head, focus on the weird techpriest cult-y lore. In general, focus more on relationships, the threat of violence between gangs, scavenging the wasteland, etc.<br/><br/>But if we're being honest to the source material, there will be lots of fighting. That'll favor certain classes, endanger others, and ignore others. I can't imagine a genuine place for the skinner in this setting (note the use of "genuine" - I can think of several strained configurations). Is a Battle Babe going to be a useable character class, in a world where "force my hand" is so hard-coded into the fiction?<br/><br/>I feel like it's a legitimate concern, and could use some thought. Writing the Skinner out of the game is a good first step. Letting someone "Go Aggro" mid-way through a fire-fight is a good second step (and perfectly rational, IMO).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247217/#Comment_247217" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-16T18:32:35+00:00" title="December 16, 2009  6:32PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 16, 2009 6:41PM by FigureFour.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well I did say "not AS violence focused", since obviously there will still be plenty of violence.<br/><br/>However, I'm looking through the Necromunda rulebook and the setting info right now and it mentions politics, trade, mining, exploration, settling . . . all sorts of non-violent activities. There are also (a few) illustrations of politicians, merchants and even a guy with a mutant baby. It even says that killing someone inside a settlement can get you and your gang banished, so presumably the settlements aren't constantly in a state of warfare.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not arguing that gang warfare and violence shouldn't be a BIG part of play (it IS inspired by a wargame after all) nor am I saying that it's not a legitimate concern, just that it's not the ONLY interesting activity happening in the setting and that I'd like to see those other options remain. You'd probably have to discuss they style of play you want for your game before you start. I'd love to play a Brainer as a cultist of Slaanesh with Unnatural Lust Transfixion, but he/she might not get along in a game about brawling gangers. However, he/she probably could have a cool story creeping around the Underhive. I wouldn't write the Skinner out for the same reasons.<br/><br/>Frankly, if I just wanted to play a game about gang warfare in the Necromunda setting . . . Well, I'd be playing Necromunda. It's exploring those options that aren't represented in the wargame that makes me interested in an RPG.<br/><br/>Oh, and can't you already go aggro in a firefight?<br/><br/>Edit: (To maybe contribute a little more) Maybe it would worth considering tweaking the playbooks to fit the more violence prone environment? Make sure everyone can advance their Hard up to +2 if they like, maybe? Maybe even add some new moves to reflect some of the classic Necromunda skills or gear? Heck, +2 Hard and fancy gear can go a long way into making ANY character into a tough guy, and they don't have to all START as tough guys. Juves are pretty wimpy until you get them a few advancements. Choppers and Hardholders are the gang leaders, Gunluggers are heavies, everyone with +1 Hard is a ganger, anyone else is a lame-o Juve.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247220/#Comment_247220" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-16T18:36:43+00:00" title="December 16, 2009  6:36PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: FigureFour</cite>Oh, and can't you already go aggro in a firefight?</blockquote>\nNot by my group's interpretation of the rules.

It does say that going aggro happens without or before fighting, so in some cases it might be too late once the bullets have started flying, but it seems like as long as you have a reasonable threat to make you should be allowed to go aggro.<br/><br/>So I'd guess "Do it or I shoot you," isn't going aggro once people are shooting, but "I've got my finger on the detonator for this bomb!" might be.

Apocalypse World seems like a better fit than most game systems -- assuming you want to focus on the stories of individuals in the Hive, and not gang warfare. There's a decent amount of background material in the rulebook to supply you with situations. I'd also point out that there are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Survival-Instinct-Necromunda-Andy-Chambers/dp/1844161889" rel="nofollow">several</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Necromunda-4-Junktion-Matthew-Farrer/dp/1844162419/ref=pd_sim_b_4" rel="nofollow">Necromunda</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Necromunda-7-Back-Nick-Kyme/dp/1844163768/ref=pd_sim_b_3" rel="nofollow">novels</a>  to draw inspiration from. I can't imagine they actually churned out half-a-dozen gang-fight-porn books without any protagonist character arcs in them.<br/><br/>As Joe points out, the art is all war-porn -- something common to all 40K products that covers up a moderate depth of world-building. I haven't played Necromunda myself, but I have played the prototype version of it, Confrontation, which was published in White Dwarf magazine in six parts. Instead of straight-40K stats, it had a percentile system, and was almost verging on a roleplaying game in it's own right. So I can see the rp possibilities in the setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247338/#Comment_247338" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-17T11:30:28+00:00" title="December 17, 2009 11:30AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lots of good comments thus far.  Not sure where to begin.  Maybe here, with the most recent comment:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite>Apocalypse World seems like a better fit than most game systems -- assuming you want to focus on the stories of individuals in the Hive, and not gang warfare. There's a decent amount of background material in the rulebook to supply you with situations. I'd also point out that there are<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1844161889/thehawfam-20" rel="nofollow">several</a>Necromundanovelsto draw inspiration from. I can't imagine they actually churned out half-a-dozen gang-fight-porn books without any protagonist character arcs in them.</blockquote>\nQuite right about the books.  I have but one of them, but it was enough to set my mind down this particular path as being a kind of muscular, hyper-dystopic version of a cyberpunk setting.  Only because I've been having such a good time with <i>Apocalypse World</i> did it occur to me that setting and system would work pretty well together.<br/><br/>The focus of a <i>Necromunda</i> game, at least one I'd run, would not be on the gang warfare.  That'd still be a part of it, but there's a lot more going on in the setting, as Dylan pointed out.  There's a whole nasty world down there in the Underhive with people working together and at cross-purposes and all of it with a heapin' helpin' of dystopianism slathered on top.<br/><br/>Will there be violence?  Sure, but the system abstracts that kind of activity such that it'd be foolish to try and replicate the wargame-y aspects of <i>Necromunda</i>.  There's not a built in discouragement of combat, but there's definitely <i>en</i>couragement to get that violence done in such a way that story and character remain paramount.  I'm okay with this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248517/#Comment_248517" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-25T06:11:41+00:00" title="December 25, 2009  6:11AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It looks like I'm actually going to run this thing in the New Year, which has me both excited and trepidatious.  One player has expressed interest in incorporating Chaos more directly into the setting than it is in the default mode, and I've said that'll work.  With the Redemptionists running around, anyone daring to engage the Chaotic is going to be in constant danger from something other than bad air, worse water and the mutants of the levels down below.<br/><br/>The real drawback is going to be getting the standard <i>Necromunda</i> setting across to the uninitiated.  Any thoughts on how or how much setting detail to share?  I figure the basic concept is about as straightforward as they come, but the added wrinkles of the Houses and how the extensive network of gangs interact with them may be a little more problematic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248744/#Comment_248744" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-27T17:14:34+00:00" title="December 27, 2009  5:14PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sam, I would read the House descriptions from the rulebook.
