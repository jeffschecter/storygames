One of the things I'm working on is a re-skinning of Kirin Robinson's Old School Hack for Shadowrun. It's for my once-in-a-blue-moon gaming group, should we get together any time soon.<br/><br/>Here is the first draft of the Street Samurai character sheet. They're currently in 11x17 format, but I'll do them in 8.5x11 too once I finish with all the classes.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.networkpipeline.com/_sgi/StreetSamSmall.png"/><br/><br/><a href="http://www.networkpipeline.com/_sgi/streetsamurai.pdf" rel="nofollow"><b>Quick PDF Export</b></a><br/><br/>If anyone is feeling up for it, I'd love to hear some feedback. I think a full on hack for Shadowrun would be pretty boss. I'm up for the challenge, but it could be hours and hours and hours of work. If anyone on SG would like to see a full hack, I'd love to know so I'm not spending time on something only my group will play with. Otherwise, I'll just do the character sheets and wing the rest probably! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356859/#Comment_356859" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-31T00:00:07+00:00" title="January 31, 2012 12:00AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 31, 2012 12:02AM by John_Harper.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes yes and YES.<br/><br/>I want this.

Glad to hear someone else will make use of these things. Winging it shouldn't be problem for most experienced GM's familiar with Redbox or Old School Hack, buuuuut I'm kinda thinking I'm just going to go ahead and do the full on hack. The character sheets are where most of the work is and at this point I'm just changing the information on the sheets for each class, so it shouldn't be too hard!<br/><br/>As far as your <b>feedback</b> is concerned, I kicked the drop-shadow, printed it, compared it to the version with the shadows, and determined that you were right. Doesn't make a huge difference, but it does make the sheet look a little brighter and uses a tiny bit less ink, which is good considering the ridiculous prices on ink now-a-days.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>I love it!<br/><br/>I want more.<br/><br/>The character sheet feels very 80s to me, which is appropriate!<br/><br/>Also I've added your blog to my RSS reader.</blockquote>\nWow! Now that you mention it, it does indeed look like an 80's style character sheet and that's about the best compliment you could given me. I totally didn't see it till you said it, and now that you said it, I love it! Totally fits the approach I plan to take on the hack itself (I do not plan to touch on pretty much anything from 4th Edition, I like it old school).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Silverlion</cite>It looks interesting, still a lot there, but it IS simplified, at a loss of customization.

Still, I have been mulling over that idea and I'm not totally against it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: framweard</cite>Yes yes yes yes. If you hack all of Shadowrun, I will get a group together to playtest for you, no joke.<br/><br/>Whisper me if you want to get this thing going. : )</blockquote>\nAwesome! But, wait... what do you mean by "hack all of Shadowrun"? I need to keep the scope limited at first otherwise I'll get overwhelmed and never finish it. But I love the enthusiasm!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wordman</cite>A couple of nit-picks:<br/><br/>1) Pretty sure it is "sheer mass", not "shear mass".

I kind of felt like the language box was a little big considering that we don't usually bring language into the mix unless someone brings it up. I agree more sample contacts would probably have a bit more cool factor.<br/><br/>Seriously, thanks for the feedback guys! Also, if you have any ideas for edges (talents), equipment, contacts, I'd love to get some group input here! I'm going to make a few slight changes to this sheet and then start working on the other classes.

Things are calmer again now and I'm trying to get my head back into a place where my hobbies actually interest me again. It's proving fairly difficult, but I've spent some time working on this Shadowrun hack and I'm pleased with how it's coming along.
