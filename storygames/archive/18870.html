No cynicism. No grim dark. Problems, sure. The ship explores strange new worlds and tries to help. And there are less-ideal competitors.<br/><br/>But really, a post-scarcity and post-prejudice polity. Even the Culture is super problematic. The Federation is not.<br/><br/>I got good ideas from the Google Plus.<br/><br/>Now I come to drink the power from a pure source:<br/><br/>OK. Let's assume that the Federation is utopia. All of the discrimination and exploitation of our world is gone. Also, you are the heroes. Though there might be some setbacks and interpersonal drama, the bad guys will be beaten. Maybe the little planet isn't ready for membership now, or maybe they have some smartening up to do, or maybe the strangers are gung ho to join. Is there any way to make assimilating the aliens an actual challenge to the players? Is there any drama to be wrung out of liberal utopianism? Old Trek was full of thrills and characters yelling at each other. But is there a drama there?  Past Trek games seemed to be about running a submarine or phaser rules. What kind of challenges are there for last people representing the end of history? Aside from crushing boredom?

Especially, I think that Star Trek could be interesting if you weren't limited to doing bourgeoisie futurism - just like you write, it could actually be a pretty radical setting if the theme were really pushed.<br/><br/>My first reaction is to wonder what it would mean to be a rebel against the system in a world where the system is a priori in the right. The answer is obviously that there is something wrong with <i>you</i> if you can't accept the system. Humans, imperfect, etc. so the Utopia would no doubt take any complaints seriously, but ultimately it is possible or even likely that some people just could not fit in. How does the Federation deal with anti-social individuals? This comes up for me as an important question, because it seems like a virtual certainty that these boundaries would be pushed in a roleplaying game. Should a player who wants to play a rebel against the system be accomodated? Should they go into it aware that their character is wrong, or how should it be handled, exactly? What does the Federation do with trouble-makers, such that it does not seem like a worst sort of dictatorship to us? Definitely interesting stuff, and I don't think that a game about this topic should sweep this aspect to the side; it's more natural to let it be, and deal with it, and thus get genuine buy-in from everybody involved for the notion that their characters are part of an authority system that is actually on the side of the angels.<br/><br/>(Yes, I often play with people whose first reaction to this premise would be to look very hard for the seams of the supposed utopia.)<br/><br/>Moving on, I think that there is no particular reason why there couldn't be challenges in a setting like this. However, they well might challenges of the imagination, rather than challenges for the characters to beat; the group playing the game has to be able to imagine how the Utopian star government would deal with various sorts of political challenges, after all - the Utopia can only be as perfect as the players can imagine it.<br/><br/>I also have to note that a lot of the content in the Star Trek mythos comes from pitching the Federation against alternative visions of modernity - how the history might end <i>instead</i> of a liberal hedonist singularity. I could see doing a traditional drama game about this topic, in fact: people playing for the highest stakes of all, with tools on the scale of battlefleets and interstellar empires. They technically have a road-map to a future that encompasses all forms of life of the entire galaxy, but when it comes down to it, so do the Klingons (militant fascism - although like everything else, the canonic depictions are mostly pretty lame), and the Borg (hive-mind communism), and they're contradictory visions. Besides, nihilism might well be a justifiable attitude in a world involving the Q, anyway.<br/><br/>However, if we put that aside and decide that the heroes are indeed going to win, then it'll play a lot more like a children's cartoon or adventure scifi television. The key realization, game design-wise, is to accept that a game can be fun even when it is about depicting something instead of creating it. As I said above, a challenge of imagination: given that the Federation principles will triumph, and given that we still want to depict humanity (or alienity, as the case may be) as what we understand them to be, how does the utopian system deal with this or that situation?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422399/#Comment_422399" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-03T18:57:40+00:00" title="October  3, 2013  6:57PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the best way to do it is to treat the Federation as the product of its history. The rights and freedoms it protects are the ones that it has had to fight for in the past, or its member planets have had to fight for. The rules that determine how the planets interact reflect a consensus which was the outcome of a civilization-wide process of reflection, argument, and conflict. It's not just the Platonic ideal of liberal democracy\u2014it's a civilization with its own history.<br/><br/>Other planets have their own histories and have made their own choices. The important part is for them to have made choices that are completely incommensurable with the Federation's way of life, but for their own very good reasons. They have had to fight to protect different values. Rules that humans, Vulcans, Andorians, et al., might consider fair (or have considered fair in the past!), might not be fair when applied in the context of a new planet\u2014say, the Bajorans, because of their history as an occupied planet. Not just because they're illiberal or undemocratic, but because they also value their own history and culture, and don't want to be subsumed.<br/><br/>What does a prospective member have to change about their cultural and political institutions in order to become eligible for Federation membership? Who benefits from those institutions as they are now? What are very good reasons for wanting to preserve them, or otherwise remain independent? Is it better to remain a small but independent planet, or an obscure junior partner in a massive bureaucratic civilization that has been built up by aliens?<br/><br/>Notice that, in our own world, a smaller nation opting in to a big federation is very unusual outside of specific contexts of shared history or long-term occupation. The formation of the European Union is probably your best model.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/arscott" title="arscott"><img alt="arscott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/arscott">arscott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422400/#Comment_422400" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-03T19:12:34+00:00" title="October  3, 2013  7:12PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think a Star Trek game will work when the federation is a milquetoast utopia.  It can still be a utopia if that's what you're going for, but it has to be a Utopia with teeth.<br/><br/>Original Star Trek was linked to the liberalism of the 60s.  But the liberalism of the 60s is the mainstream of today.  If your game is about that utopia, there's no conflict and no compelling theme.  You may as well be playing a game of phaser settings and submarine warfare.<br/><br/>The only way you'll have a Trek game that thrives on its theme is to base it on a political philosophy rooted in the 21st century.  And sure, those philosophies are more pessimistic those that governed when star trek first arrived on the airwaves.  That might mean that your game is more pessimistic--But that doesn't mean your characters can't still be white-hats.<br/><br/>Otherwise, your game won't Be Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock.  It'll be Captain Archer and T'Pol.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422402/#Comment_422402" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-03T20:12:49+00:00" title="October  3, 2013  8:12PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To be honest, I would rather play Enterprise than Star Trek and explore how Utopia was made (perhaps Microscope?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422403/#Comment_422403" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-03T20:22:14+00:00" title="October  3, 2013  8:22PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Trek canon of the new series offers lots of great, challenging questions to utopia without getting grimdark.

Whatever the situation, the players will always have to be able to feel that the Utopia has their back. Even if a given player character disagrees with the establishment, it has to be the case that it's the character who is flawed, or perhaps a demographic faction of the society (only people, after all), and not the Utopia itself.<br/><br/>The above probably implies that the players will have to have a big role in determining and discussing the particulars of what the Federation society is like. I imagine a rules system that enables us to put aspects of the society under discourse, and enables us to determine: has this particular thing already become utopian, or is it merely on the way there? Or, are we going to break the campaign and declare: the Federation, as we have imagined it here, cannot be Utopia, for we have discovered an intractable contradiction.<br/><br/>I don't see the challenge of playing the Utopia as necessarily milquetoast; it would only be such if we decided to not only do Utopia, but also to do a childish fairytale of such. The difference is in how we treat humanity: the fairy tale Federation would never have a rebellion, for example, because it's a nice place <i>by definition</i>, and therefore we sacrifice psychological realism, glossing over what human beings are really like. The utopian Federation, however, might well have a situation like we see in <i>Into Darkness</i>: an ambitious and frustrated sociopath has managed to work his way into a position of responsibility, and is now in position to ruin the Federation. This breaks the fairytale premise ("Everything in Federation is always great!"), but it is a legit situation for a serious political game that explores the idea of Utopia: given that we have at least not yet established that Utopia is only possible with perfect human beings, what happens when an imperfect one gets into a position of authority? How will the Federation improve to prevent such in the future?<br/><br/>Considering my lemma above, it would be of utmost importance for the GM (or whatever provides adversity) to acknowledge freely that yes, this sociopathic fleet admiral is an evil person, and the Federation's system failed here despite best intentions. Thus players may still preserve their fidelity towards the Federation, feeling that the system has merely failed in practice, and not failed as an ideal. If the GM instead wanted to establish that such failures are an intrinsic  part of the Federation's system, and the political leadership doesn't want to do anything about it because they benefit from the flaws, he would be undermining the premise that their society is perfect, or at least on the way there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biffboff" title="biffboff"><img alt="biffboff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/189/nI5NYQDMCBCPG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biffboff">biffboff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422406/#Comment_422406" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-03T21:20:31+00:00" title="October  3, 2013  9:20PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha!

Leave the baggage behind! Don't get hung up on what happened last time. Whole new episode. Even Edith Keeler didn't stop Kirk from doinking Orion slave girls (although, for the record, Kirk never had sex with Marta from "Whom Gods Destroy"). Somebody might cite "Dances With Wolves" and cultural imperialism or appropriation but they would clearly be Khoms, not Yangs. Embrace dichotomies. Sure, white on one side and black on the other might be obvious to us. But what about <i>male </i> during the day and <i>female </i> at night!  Oh, Kirk, what WILL you do in the morning? And this is where the elephant sits quietly in the corner: allegory.<br/><br/>Big Damn Heroes: There's a hierarchy to the crew, let's not kid ourselves. It's Captain, Spock, Bones, and the other four (can you name them? Can you name them in importance? Hint: Scotty comes next). But in a GAME you want everyone to be important; everyone to be involved. Here's the thing: if you beam down to a planet and nobody has seen you before (ie: your a "Red Shirt"), then you're fodder. Scotty wears a Red Shirt but he's named. If we have to KNOW the name of a character then he/she MUST be important. Not plot immune; just important.<br/><br/>Sorry. It's late. I'm tired. Love me some old time Trek, tho'.

Here are a couple of examples:<br/><br/>1. The Vulcans and the Romulans are one race divided by the religion of Surak. Since the series are all Federation-centric, we know how the Romulans appear to the Vulcans: atavistic, arrogant, and out of control. But we also see enough of the Vulcans (especially in <i>Enterprise</i>) to infer how they must appear to the Romulans: hypocritical, domineering, in denial about the moral ambiguities that characterize the messy, passionate world. The majority of both races, and their political leaders, are content with the status quo, which is characterized by a cold, festering stand-off punctuated by rare and devastating outbursts of open war.<br/><br/>Both sides have their dissenters and defectors. But there are also a few, especially long-sighted leaders on both sides who see that the only peaceful outcome will involve a reconciliation of these two races. Some of these leaders, including high-ranking Federation diplomats, have been at work behind the scenes, covertly, to create the conditions for Vulcan-Romulan reunification. The first step is to create grass root support in the Romulan Empire for political reform and a permanent peace and alliance with the Federation.<br/><br/>The thing that interests me about this storyline (which is from TNG season 5, a two-parter called "Unification I" and "II"), is that it has the protagonists working in the shadows, using some of the methods of spies and insurgents. Sometimes that's how you have to defend and propagate your utopia! PSYOPS for peace!<br/><br/>2. The Federation fought a years-long war with the Cardassians, which ended in a treaty and an exchange of territory. The Cardassians ceded some planets they'd occupied that had native intelligent life, most notably Bajor (setting of DS9). In exchange, the Federation ceded a number of M-class planets that had no native intelligent life which it had earmarked for colonization. This was a compromise the Federation needed to make in order to protect and support the Bajorans, who are prospective Federation members.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, those planets earmarked for colonization already had some settlements on them. These settlements were maybe a little ahead of schedule in terms of the Federation's colonization plan, which means they are technically illegal but only in the sense that they're improper, but nobody was actually being harmed. But, you know, now they have been ceded to the Cardassians, and this was necessary for the greater good. The Federation is loath to abandon citizens behind enemy lines, and they order everyone to abandon those colonies. But those settlements were now home to thousands or millions of people, who would be damned if they were giving up their homes because some diplomat in San Fransciso drew a plane through a sphere differently from yesterday.<br/><br/>So, instead, they form an armed resistance to the Cardassians, and they call themselves the Maquis. They're enemies of the Cardassians, but they're none too friendly to the Federation, either. They sometimes steal Federation supplies and equipment. And the Federation has to treat them as outlaws, because they threaten the extremely tenuous peace with Cardassia. But the Federation also sometimes helps them out, and Maquis sympathizers within Starfleet sometimes provide material support illegally. How does utopia deal with that situation?<br/><br/>(<i>Voyager</i> starts off with the eponymous Federation ship in pursuit of a Maquis raider, when they are swept across the galaxy to the Delta Quadrant. The violence of the disaster wipes out about half the crews of both ships, including much of the <i>Voyager</i>'s senior crew, so Captain Janeway proposes an amnesty and a crew merging. Which the Maquis accept, but, of course, with the reservation <i>"that's easy for you to say"</i>\u2014and that's an important source of tension in the first couple of seasons.)<br/><br/>These are just two examples! There are others!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422621/#Comment_422621" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-09T05:06:22+00:00" title="October  9, 2013  5:06AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK,<br/>  To get the TOS feel, you almost have to structure the game like DitV. Where each planet has a problem, but not a pre-baked solution. This planet received transmissions of mobster TV shows and now everyone wants apiece of the action. This planet has a disease where all the adults die, and has evolved around the consequences of that. This planet is ruled by omnipotent, but inhuman beings. These are all problems that need solving. The coneit of the Utopic setting is that in the Federation, these problems have already been solved. Spock will weed out the fallacies hat the world's problems rely, Bones will heal the people, Scotty will fix their bad tech and Kirk will push them until their humanity surfaces.<br/>  And ou are right, for TOS to work, you can't have the Maquis or Section 31. NOMAD is a produt of a broken world, not a broken federation, right?<br/>  Just my thoughts, hope it helps!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422622/#Comment_422622" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-09T05:36:10+00:00" title="October  9, 2013  5:36AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been slowly pulling together a Star Trek inspired game for a while. Dogs in the Vineyards is definitely an important touch-stone, for creating worlds as sources of conflict. Another important thing to realize - in the Trek-esque genre only two things matter: Culture and Tech. Its not hard to find good examples of making cultural conflict vibrant and interesting. But with Trek-esque gaming you have two choices with Tech - making its conflicts interesting or simply downplay the technobabble part of things (which personally feels like letting down the genre).<br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422669/#Comment_422669" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-09T15:49:00+00:00" title="October  9, 2013  3:49PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some good inspiration might also come from <i>Shock:</i> as far as mixing culture &amp; tech and making conflicts out of them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_423387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/contracycle" title="contracycle (Banned)"><img alt="contracycle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/contracycle">contracycle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423387/#Comment_423387" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-26T08:48:56+00:00" title="October 26, 2013  8:48AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a note, one of Roddenberry's dictates to writers was that conflict must never originate from within the Fed.
