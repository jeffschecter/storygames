So even though I was reluctant to throw my bullshit around, here it is anyway:<br/><br/>I've been checking in with Undying now and then since the beginning, and it looks sharp -- clever, focused design, innovative use of the AW base to create something really new, blah blah blah deserving of praise etc. But then I see this rule:<br/><br/><b>When you wake for the evening, spend 1 Blood.</b><br/><br/>And I'm like, "fuck this game." I can't help it!<br/><br/>Because I hate this rule. I hate the shit out of this rule. Maybe I don't hate it more than any other rule ever, but if we exclude the rules that I would never even consider using in play and would make me leave a game if someone else did, it's probably pretty close. Yes, the "fix" in Undying is better than the one in Vampire. I still have issues.<br/><br/>I used to run Vampire a whole lot, many years ago, so I have a lot of experience telling people "another day is over, you wake up, lose a blood point." And what do they do? They respond by pixelbitching. I guess because there's a resource loss there, but possibly only because I describe time in terms of days, they always have to try and cram as much game-important activity into each and every night. If you try to tell them a week passes, it's like you are saing the apocalypse has arrived. Maye they were supposed to be playing ancient, immortal vampires, replete with cunning patience, but they always ended up playing undead speed freaks.<br/><br/>Because this rule isn't just about blood, it's also about time: It demarcates days as the basic measurement of time in the game. This is appropriate for vampires, sure, but rather superficially and only during times of extreme action or danger. In fact, I would say it is far more appropriate as a measurement of time for the victims of vampire attacks than it is for the vampires themselves. If these creatures are supposed to be ancient, then they're going to have to find routines that will support them over the course of years and decades, where they can wait for annoyances, threats, and enemies to grow old and die. Or where they can wait for advantages to grow over the course of time. None of this kind of behaviour is encouraged by measuring time in days, regardless of the vampire's nocturnal lifestyle. Instead it makes you want to get the most out of your blood point loss, because time is always your enemy. And why should time be your enemy? Are you not immortal?<br/><br/>Finally, there's another issue. One blood per day is a thing in the setting. It's not just an abstract game mechanic that works at the speed of plot, it's an empirical fact that vampires lose the equivalent of 36.5 people worth of blood every year just by existing.* Aside from custom moves, that doesn't leave a lot of room to customize the fiction of each individual vampire's bloodlust. It's hard to turn that measurement of blood loss per day into an emotional state. It makes it easier to consider it merely a strategic concern and nothing more.<br/><br/>* Fun fact quiz: If vampires existed in the US in the same numbers White Wolf assumes, how many people would they have to kill every year to exceed the actual homicide rate? For 1993, it's just 9 people each. Now try to imagine vampires living in non-homicidal countries!<br/><br/>Right, now the "fix." Back in the day, the Storyteller's Handbook introduced a rule for time passing: when we come back to you, roll a d10 for how many blood points you have! So basically, you have at least a 10 per cent chance of automatically murdering the shit out of whomever the Storyteller frames you into a scene with. The thing about BOTH versions, the d10 and the start-at-full, is that after you've been working towards your goals and managing your resources, this rule comes along and arbitrarily resets things. So even though you are back at full, which is good, if you play out a hunting scene to get more blood and you ended up making certain sacrifices or causing a certain amount of trouble, and then th GM calls for time passing, the gains you made, in blood, become meaningless. It's like, why did you end up playing that scene in the first place? And I don't mean to imply any maliciousness on the GM's part here -- the order of scenes and events can make sense to everybody, and then still leave the player feeling a bit cheated. They worked for something and then everybody else gets it for free, and they could have too.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I CAN see it encouraging people to go all-in during what is obviously a climax, spending most of their blood pretty secure in knowing that time will pass right after this event goes down BUT (and maybe it's just me) that also feels a little to desperate a ploy for ancient, immortal vampires to be throwing down on a regular basis. At least it DOES encourage players to lobby for time passing, so they can pass GO and collect their $200, so it's got that going for it over Vampire's awful d10.<br/><br/>Now, just as a comparison point, if I mentally re-skin Undying into a game about the violent upward social mobility of cannibal gang-lords in a Necromunda-style hive city, the rules as-is actually make a lot of sense. A LOT of sense. Because it's fast-paced, constantly violent, every day matters, you're preying on the weak to increase your social status and influence. You could also swap out the danger of sunlight for something else, depending on the world you want to portray. Maybe if the gang-lords don't meet manufacturing quotas, the Imperial overlords flush the whole sector and repopulate it with new convict-workers. Also, with this setting, I wouldn't be asking the question: "If it's so easy to get killed in this game, why is it called Undying? Is it supposed to be ironic?"<br/><br/>So yeah, anyway, those are the various problems I had (and still have) with using that rule in play. It really did annoy the shit out of me after I figured out how it was influencing the games I ran. I can probably think of a few alternatives, but it really depends on your goals for the game, and this could very well just be my problem to get over.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419893/#Comment_419893" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-11T17:22:48+00:00" title="August 11, 2013  5:22PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Weird, we just played this for four or five sessions and it was never a problem, certainly not a pooping-type problem.

Specifically, the idea of routines that the vampires develop to manage their everyday blood needs.<br/><br/>In Undying, usually, each session covers a particular night in which shit goes down and everyone makes their plays that they've been plotting for days/months/years/decades. Then you do the "passage of time" move ahead to another important shit-going-down night. So your comparison to Necromunda gang lords is apt. Our games have totally worked that way -- desperate explosions of activity.<br/><br/>But, the "wake up, spend 1 blood" is totally a VtM thing, and might very well be out of place here, as a "fact" of vampire life. If Paul wants to talk options, I have some thoughts on alternatives, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419895/#Comment_419895" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-11T21:06:30+00:00" title="August 11, 2013  9:06PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting!<br/><br/>I agree with the comments about the problems with these various rules, but I'd also say that the "when you wake up..." rule in Undying is probably my favourite.<br/><br/>For all the problems Johnstone lists above, it's got one thing going for it:<br/><br/>* It really nails down the concept of the vampire: every time you wake up, there's this reminder, to both the character and the player.

It is a very VtM thing. That\u2019s not what burned me, so I\u2019m interested to better understand the pathos of the argument. <br/><br/>The logos part where we debate the statistical consequences of a blood per night on the human population\u2026show me your peer-reviewed, three sigma, multi-dimensional diff eq predator-prey simulation of a fantasy creature that proves your case and we'll talk. Otherwise, let\u2019s chalk it up to vampires are make-believe and move on.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">@Johnstone</a>, I hear where you're coming from.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">@John_Harper</a>, if you have some thoughts, lay it on me.<br/><br/>As <a href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">@Jason_Morningstar</a> points out, it hasn't been a point of contention in any of the playtests I've participated in or heard back on so far. And, as John points out, there's also the passage of time move that does the jump ahead thing.<br/><br/>I'm willing to mod/eliminate this thing; but, consider the move in its full context. If this is a problem, I\u2019m looking for a solution \u2013- a better one than I apparently have -- that addresses all the perceived problems in an elegant way that ties in with the theme and the rest of the mechanics. Otherwise, it stands as-is, full stop. That\u2019s your chinning bar.<br/><br/>To throw an immediate bone, I will add a note to the Predator Lore custom section that says specifically that the waking move can be changed to some other periodicity or removed entirely at the group\u2019s discretion. FYI - The Predator Lore section already says that the gaming group has carte blanch to add/mod/delete stuff to customize their vampire experience.<br/><br/>So you understand where I'm coming from\u2026<br/><br/>(This goes back to Johnstone\u2019s post) There are two time scales in Undying: tactical and strategic \u2013 I\u2019m borrowing some Regiment syntax here because that\u2019s how I think. The tactical time scale is measured in nights (or, as in most of my experiences \u2013 a night). The strategic time scale is measured in weeks, months, years, decades, or centuries.<br/><br/>In the tactical situation, a vampire\u2019s immortality is called into question and we care about each and every choice made and the tally of blood in and blood out. More importantly, we care about what shortcuts a vampire takes to get through that night. That\u2019s the blood-humanity cycle. The tactical scale is where plots are acted on and, win or lose, the status quo changes. This is where a character\u2019s immortality is not so certain and we see if they survive to see another moonrise.<br/><br/>The strategic scale is addressed by the passage of time move, where the plots surface and fester and the details of night-to-night blood maintenance are not relevant. We know vampires are immortal and that they can establish long term routines to preserve that immortality, so there\u2019s no need to micromanage. The GM has a part of this move and so do the players.<br/><br/>For reference, see: <a href="http://enigmamachinations.wordpress.com/2013/06/24/undying-3-1-released/" rel="nofollow">enigmamachinations.wordpress.com/2013/06/24/undying-3-1-released/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419907/#Comment_419907" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-12T04:24:50+00:00" title="August 12, 2013  4:24AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, your strategic and tactical split is pretty much how I see the two competing vampire tropes, too: the vampire as ravenous beast, addict, or parasite vs. the vampire as immortal, shadowy manipulator. You can go back and forth between them, but you can't have both at the same time. Howard Hughes the junkie isn't the same as the dudes in Trainspotting, for instance. He has a system set up to get his fix, so he can focus on strategy instead of tactics, and his decline is much more gradual than your average street addict, even if he gets to the same place at the end.<br/><br/>But Vampire's switch between the two was pretty much the d10. It was a crap shoot, and players never had much incentive to push for it. Maybe there were more rules later on, I had a bunch of books but nowhere near all, even though I played it for years on end. If there actually WAS a system for setting up a power base, security, and a routine so that the blood-loss rules no longer applied and you could get some long-term goals accomplished in Vampire, I'd have been a lot happier running it. And if the tactical aspect of play was clearly defined, both situationally (say, when war breaks out, either because you begin hunting another vampire or they come after you; or when you lose control of all your assets, servants, routines and whatnot and you need to forcibly carve new ones out of the mortal world before opportunistic vampires take you out) and fictionally (as a heightened state of awareness and/or the hunting instinct, a "blood in the water brings on the frenzy" type thing), then I might not even dislike that blood points are lost per day.<br/><br/>But the Undying text kinda gives strategy the brush-off. It says it's there for storytelling purposes, to put distance between the action scenes basically. It's a bit like window dressing that allows us to say these characters are immortal vampires, instead of jacked-up hive gangers (and I'm not dissing that concept either, it would be pretty rad). Part of the fun of a political vampire game for me would be setting up plans and pawns during those stretches, actually building things, so I could bring them to bear in tactical engagements. Perhaps I'm just reading the text uncharitably and your intention is that I should play it the way I would play it. I do feel the game text isn't encouraging me, though. And maybe that's the way you want it! It IS wrong of me to complain about which aspects of the vampire mythos you chose to focus the game on.<br/><br/>However, I think chalking it up to vampires as make-believe is an easy out. On the one hand, sure, we want to play vampires-as-dramatic-story and not vampires-as-literal-disease (or any other exercise in masturbatory verisimilitude). But on the other hand, the very nature of rpgs involves creating fictional structures and then imagining the implications. Using a measurement of time as it passes for the characters establishes something in the fiction, at the level of things that we are supposed to be imagining as "true." White Wolf literally asked their customers to imagine a world where America is home to 3,000 vampires that each require the equivalent of one person's blood every 10 days just in order to be awake, with the only way out being torpor. Of course the implications of this are idiotic, and yet this was still the fiction they presented and we were expected to engage with. Even if we decide that vampires ignore science and whatnot, that just ignores the why, not the what. If blood loss is measured in character-time, it's kind of hard to just ignore that fact when I'm taking my character's perspective. At least it is for me, anyway -- I'm not thinking "okay I have this lust for blood, how do I deal with it?" I'm always thinking "okay, I lose 1 blood per day, how do I deal with that?"<br/><br/>So yeah, it's not the fact that it's days that I hate, either. If there's a difference between strategic and tactical in the fiction, with regular blood loss being a feature of the tactical, then days is the logical unit to choose. That's why it's days in Vampire. If that's not the angle you want to take, if it's more about the vampire-as-story-arc (which is the impression I get from the text), then I think you should swap out blood-loss-per-day for something else that uses a game measurement (scenes, sessions, certain actions by characters) instead. Also, it kind of feels like getting off on the wrong foot if as soon as we sit down to play, I'm saying "we're going to take this rule out," as opposed to: "there's a rule for losing blood points to the ravenous hunger inside in here, but we can define what that actually is for our campaign," you know? I hope all that makes my issue pretty clear and my other baggage isn't getting in the way of my point.<br/><br/>As for suggesting an alternate measurement to use, I wish I had a perfect fix, but I don't think I do. I would assume that 1 per session would make it almost meaningless as a loss. But then, 1 per scene seems like a pretty damn monstrous hunger.

It was thematic than volumetric - to regain Body you needed to feed in the midst of a bestial, energetic activity, but to regain Mind you needed to feed in a cultured contemplative manner. This helped to reflect the addict nature of a vampire's hunger - anything a vampire does which doesn't involve drinking blood is hollow and unfulfilling.  Sure you can try to lock yourself away and suffer through an unlife of doing nothing to avoid feeding, but how long do you think you can stand that?<br/><br/>  - Mendel<br/><br/>Edited to add: In looking more closely at the game, I see its much more vampires as predators, rather than as addicts. This approach may not be of much use then.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419909/#Comment_419909" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-12T05:57:17+00:00" title="August 12, 2013  5:57AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For what it's worth, I like the rule.

Let me know if I'm still not hearing you correctly.<br/><br/>Point 1 - The nightly blood thing, if extrapolated across the fictional vampire population of an expected size, would result in an unrealistic number of human deaths and that break with the fiction where I say "Everything's cool don't worry about it" is a big turn off.<br/><br/>Point 2 - The nightly blood thing, emphasizes tactical play and forces a strategic-minded character to break from their careful plotting to join the fray, when they may not actually do so.<br/><br/>Point 3 - The strategic play element of Undying, as written, is primarily an interlude between tactical events.<br/><br/>To the first point, I view the blood thing as a fictional pacing mechanism and a manifestation of hunger in mechanical terms. It's not an attempt, as <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> put it, to simulate the vampire parasite. As you point out, scene-by-scene is too much to be workable and week-by-week is too small to be meaningful. To not have a spend blood to exist move at all would mean you only need blood to fuel your superpowers, and that seems like a bad message to me. Maybe there's some clever way to enforce the hunger principle with a different mechanization? I'll have a solid four hours on an airplane today, so I'll give this some more thought.<br/><br/>To the second and third points, Undying <i>is</i> about the upset of things. To clarify, in Undying, tactical play is not about the development of long-term strategy, it's about resolving a breakdown of the status quo (i.e. the fulfillment of a stratagem). Maybe that's a fundamental difference in the objectives of tactical play between Undying and Vampire: where, in Vampire, tactical play is the <i>only framework</i> for developing a long term strategy. In Undying, the tactical phase is about the resolution and the strategic phase (passage of time move) is about the setup of future conflict.<br/><br/>As you point out, there's not a lot of depth to the passage of time move (strategic phase). The GM makes some new hard moves and each character gets to choose a number of fictional "advances" for their schemes. It is my design intention to quickly resolve the scheming phase to return to the action phase. That said, there's no count-down clock, so folks can take as much time as they want going through it. However, the idea is to focus the play experience on doing rather than preparations for doing.<br/><br/>If you are keen to play Undying and you want more of the scheming, a thing you might do is daisy-chain passage of time moves end to end. The GM decides what the time jump is and you can play it on the weeks or months scale if you want to. You can keep making passage of time moves back-to-back until something comes up that demands resolution. If that doesn't cut it, then what you want may be beyond what Undying is meant to deliver.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419917/#Comment_419917" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-12T09:03:31+00:00" title="August 12, 2013  9:03AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 12, 2013 9:13AM by nemomeme.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I\u2019ve only played two short games of Undying and never played Vampire.<br/> <br/>I don\u2019t know whether the rule is good as is or not, but I really like the tactical effect of it in terms of the game session economy. It seems like for an ongoing game it serves to help shift the spotlight around a bit ala PTA. Some sessions you hunt, take care of your blood pool and have some color &amp; building scenes rather than pushing too hard. Some sessions while other predators are taking care of their hunger, you swoop in on their concerns. Even so, scene and spotlight economy seem like a more pressing resource than a single Blood.<br/> <br/>I also feel like it drives the pressure to raise your social status in a cool way. If I\u2019m MC\u2019ing and a PC is at a place fictionally where they\u2019ve got some status and therefore some relationships that give them greater access to the herd, they\u2019re going to be in a much better place to shorthand/handwave replacing that Blood - the vamp that\u2019s got it all together and looking more towards a grand strategy.<br/> <br/>I don\u2019t personally feel any pints per population concerns.<br/><br/>(crosspost with above)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419918/#Comment_419918" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-12T09:11:10+00:00" title="August 12, 2013  9:11AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Side note from a person who is still dying (har har) to run/play this game: I've been wondering about how that move would work since I first read the rules, so this conversation is super interesting to me. <br/><br/>I was a little worried about this leading to every session starting with my players going in search of blood, so I thought up a sort of fiction-based contingency plan in case that ever became an issue: Predators can get up to 1 blood a day from refrigerated blood (and no more, no matter how much of it they drink), so long as that blood is no more than 3 days old. It's just enough to offset concerns about the skyrocketing murder rate, and it gives some obvious starting dependencies with NPCs (whoever controls the blood bank) right off the bat. Of course, any setting could also have "blood bars" or "prey brothels" with willing victims, charging Debt to enter, so there are other ways to deal with this in the fiction, too.<br/><br/>To be honest, though, I kind of like that the game is vague/bare-bones enough that I felt encouraged to come up with ways to explain in the setting ways to address this hard-coded dependency. I saw it like the note in Apocalypse World that the players lose 1 Barter a month for basic material needs (and I could see adding just a line \u2013 not to the moves, but to the GM's section \u2013\xa0along the lines of, "Do members of the community have any standing arrangements to offset nightly blood loss?"). It's a mechanic that encourages PCs to keep hustling, and fictional explanations of it can really foreground the importance of the community in predator existence. But again, I've yet to play Undying, so just take all of this as an aside from someone who thinks about game rules maybe a little too much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419920/#Comment_419920" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-12T09:50:20+00:00" title="August 12, 2013  9:50AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Worried about Blood?

It is not a rules requirement that a vamp ever kill anyone.<br/>2) You can buy a Herd stat that keeps a pool of available victims handy<br/>3) There was a specific mechanic for automating hunts<br/><br/>The fact that this rule exists is what makes vamps <i>social </i>predators.  Without it, much of the significance of being a vamp is lost.  Vamps can't drop out and move to a cabin in the hills to live out their days, it's just not an option for them.  This is the reason they need to control humans, which is the reason they have ghouls and whatnot, and why they can't ignore the human world.  That's why it is also important for them to have social powers to control humans, not just physical powers with which to fight each other.  <br/><br/>I always disliked the whole bar-serving-vitae thing, as it IMO totally undermined the point of the setting.  Further, the vamp Prince had few enough duties as it is, keeping tabs on feeding practices and the mortality rate is the one "public service" they provide to justify their position.  Therefore, I think this rule in VtM filled a vital function in keeping vamps grounded, and was a big part of what made it different from being a monchrome Supers game.<br/><br/>I can't speak for Undying, but in VtM, if you're having trouble topping up, and leaving a trail of bodies everywhere you go, then you're doing it wrong and should get your act together before the Prince is compelled to take matters in hand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_Riddle" title="Paul_Riddle"><img alt="Paul_Riddle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_Riddle">Paul_Riddle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419925/#Comment_419925" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-12T10:43:30+00:00" title="August 12, 2013 10:43AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/contracycle">@contracycle</a>, it works more or less the same way; but, with AW style fictional-mechanical integration with the game's two stats, humanity and status.<br/><br/>As <a href="/forums/profile/JasonT">@JasonT</a> points out, the game is a framework and you hang your brand of vampire on top of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419939/#Comment_419939" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-12T13:01:17+00:00" title="August 12, 2013  1:01PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can see the argument that ancient, intelligent creatures with high status shouldn't have to worry about "daily feeding", having something in place to supplement them. <br/><br/>On that basis, I could see making the "when you wake..." move be contingent on your Status. As long you maintain high Status, you don't have to worry about the feeding. If you lose your quality of life, though... now it's a problem.<br/><br/>But when I think of it that way, it sounds like a resource-collecting game. Isn't it more interesting to play out this stuff in the fiction? Your high-Status, genius IQ vampire *should* have some kind of reliable source of blood (whether it's a private brothel or a friend at the blood bank), true. Why don't we see how *you* come up with that for yourself, play it out: use it as a story element which can then be bartered, sold, or threatened by unpleasant circumstances.<br/><br/>Not a rhetorical question: I can imagine lots of reasons why that *wouldn't* be more interesting. It's just my default approach, because it sounds like it would give us some good material for play, as opposed to just seeing it as a "level up" where you don't have to worry about resources anymore. (For instance, if you have a slave you feed on every few days, what happens if someone else bends this slave to their will?

It sounds like from your perspective the passage of time move is open-ended that it could play to the immortal scheming as much as I would want it to, so I'll keep an open mind and not hassle you any more about that aspect.<br/><br/>For point 1, I think you get me there too, but let me try to clarify. The actual numbers of vampires and stats and crap doesn't matter (especially since Undying defines rather few aspects of vampirism and leaves the rest up to actual play), and the ridiculousness comes from a collection of setting elements, not just daily blood loss. The moment of cognitive dissonance for me is when one aspect of the game invites extrapolation and another tells me to ignore the urge to extrapolate instead of giving me a reason not to extrapolate (eh, that probably doesn't make much sense). I have a thing that's true in the setting because there's a rule enforcing it, but then I have another thing that tells me not to think of the implications of the first thing being a thing in the setting because of game stuff, instead of having another thing in the setting that stops me from thinking about the implications of the first thing. Best I can do right now.<br/><br/>Anyway, whatever. Honestly, from your explanations here, if we sat down to play I don't think I'd have any of that cognitive dissonance. Playing scenes, using the moves, losing blood when you wake -- these are only for flashpoints, short instances of danger, trouble, and strife. For times of safety, we use the passage of time move, not the other moves, and we don't lose blood. Right? I'm cool with that. I'd <i>way</i> rather extrapolate that into fiction than VtM's crap. BUT the text as it stands doesn't really convey this to me and I think you should put it up-front more. If I get that, crystal-clear, right from the beginning, I'm eager to read the whole thing and play it, instead of groaning and wondering how much of that VtM stuff I didn't like I'm going to have to put up with along the way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_Riddle" title="Paul_Riddle"><img alt="Paul_Riddle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_Riddle">Paul_Riddle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419949/#Comment_419949" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-12T16:33:29+00:00" title="August 12, 2013  4:33PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>, you've basically summed up the hunting move.
