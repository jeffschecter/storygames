Is that also contrary to Sandbox play? Should a Sandbox GM go through everything in their Sandbox and label it (figuratively) either H or D?</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>One of the things that\u2019s going on in a roleplaying game is \u201cintroducing elements\u201d. You add something to the shared imagined space. \u201cHey, there\u2019s a flower here\u201d is introducing an element (the element is the flower).</p>\n<p>In the Sandbox idiom, the ideal is to, whenever you introduce an element such as a mirror, also commit to its effects, whether it\u2019s magical, and what that magic is. When you introduce an element such as a monster, also commit to its stats. You introduce <em>complete</em> elements.</p>\n<p>In the Impro idiom, the ideal is to, whenever you introduce an element, stay open-minded about any possible endowments to that element, and build on what you hear at the table. For example, you might say \u201cthere\u2019s something vertical covered by a cloth\u201d; you don\u2019t even have committed to the idea that it\u2019s a mirror, let alone a magical one. Or you might have ideas that you\u2019re holding lightly.</p>\n<p>So much of RPG history and wargame history is based on this idea of introducing complete elements. It\u2019s probably the most common mode of OSR play (though not universal to the OSR).</p>\n<p>But, since I initially skipped over Moldvay and Mentzer on my journey through RPGs, it took me about 20 years and reading around 80 games before I came across this idea. I wasn\u2019t the first person to play with \u201cintroduce complete elements\u201d as a practice. But, I (in a way that was a shock to me) came from a background of Impro play and expecting Impro practice, and found out how much I enjoyed playing in a Sandbox. Making the journey from Impro player to Sandbox player is one that a couple of other posters here on S-G have done, but it used to be that the opposite direction was much more common.</p>\n<p>I started playing in the 90:s. A lot of games had during the 80:s and up into the 00:s, made the gradual / partial journey from Sandbox idiom to Impro idiom, and introducing Impro techniques had been the vogue (was Costikyan\u2019s Ghostbusters the first one? Or T&amp;T?) for a while. They had also been going through a journey from exploration based to story based.</p>\n<p>So everywhere I looked when I was growing up, it was these games that were sort of like cronenbergian half-way between the Impro idiom and the Sandbox idiom, games caught in the growing pains of trying to figure out what they were (and my favorites became the ones that <em>did</em> know what they was and did so coherently, like Everyway and Fudge). Well, even if those half-way games were good, and they might very well be, I didn\u2019t understand them. Because I didn\u2019t undersntand the Sandbox idiom, the idea of introducing complete elements.</p>\n<p><em>When</em> you introduce an element to the shared imagined space is also an issue. In the Sandbox idiom, elements can be introduced way in advance. In the game, the element of the mirror and its effects was introduced to room 80 on the DM\u2019s map long before the players even got <em>close</em> to that room. In fact, it was introduced long before the campaign even started and not by the DM, it was by the module writer (Greg Gillespie).</p>\n<p>Tangent: \u201cHow the hecks can it be part of \u2018shared\u2019 imagined space before it has been established at the table?\u201d In the Sandbox idiom, the expectation of introduced elements is that they have a large degree of completeness. And the existance of the Barrowmaze as an element in and of itself had been established at the table. But in the Impro idiom, the expectation of introduced elements is that they might be endowed later, and that they\u2019ll be introduced together, during play (but in the \u201cbuilding platform\u201d part of play, to be reincorporated later).</p>\n<p>I had playing improvised style for most of my life. At first, making things up as we went along to steer the story into what <em>I</em> thought was cool [had very low player retention during this era, but couldn\u2019t figure out why], and only in the last couple of years discovering the capital I Impro idea of building on <em>each others\u2019</em> ideas.</p>\n<p>Then, my \u201cmirror experience\u201d was this: first, we played one session of The Lost City and we got pretty far down into it. (We came to the madaruans\u2019 quarters.) Later that night, I read the module myself and thought \u201cHuh. It was all real? Interesting, I just assumed it was all improvised like I\u2019d do. Oh, and there was <em>so</em> much more? Amazing. Wish I hadn\u2019t read it, we could\u2019ve kept on playing, I thought it was just a one-shot.\u201d But still my mind was intact. Then we played Barrowmaze and my mind melted. The tangibility of having read The Lost City and knowing that all of it was solidly there. Then experiencing it again <em>with the expectation that it was \u2018real\u2019</em>\u2026</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Andye" rel="nofollow">Andye</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/></p><p>Obviously this is totally impractical, but in principle what is best practice?</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>This is also a very good point. The ideal <em>is</em> impractical. It\u2019s just a \u201ccompass pole\u201d. A couple of times I\u2019ve ran complete game worlds (Lost Mines of Phandelver and Curse of Strahd) where all elements was introduced before we started the game (and introduced by the module writing team, not by me), and I\u2019ve loved it. In both cases, the areas were small with few sub-elements. I started working on my own campaign that would be much bigger, to a great extent computer generated and table driven etc etc. A <em>much</em> larger region. But I got burned out and never finished working on it. Finally we needed to just get back to the table, we hadn\u2019t been playing for half a year. So what we\u2019re doing now is that I do try to introduce the elements way in advance but I still have so much to do. For example, it\u2019s been established that White Plume Mountain (a module) exists <em>somewhere</em> within travel distance, but I haven\u2019t fixed it\u2019s location yet (!!!!). I placed out four dungeons to start (The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan, The Genies\u2019 Second Wager, The Mermaid\u2019s Knot and the Stygian Garden). Just so we could get going.</p>\n<p>I do want to <em>someday</em> run that ideal \u201cbig complete element\u201d, especially one I\u2019ve made myself. I see some OSR bloggers post about such giant sandboxes. But I\u2019ve never managed to do it. (All of the Curse of Strahd fits in about two 24-mile hexes.)</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464697/#Comment_464697" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-07T17:26:31+00:00" title="July  7, 2017  5:26PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now I see it! The context was really important here to get the idea, since most of GMs and players I know in person and here, as well as my own personal experience in learning RPGs is from the opposite direction.<br/><br/>In my case -dunno how things were for the rest of the other posters here- my reasoning was influenced by my early years as a GM, when I got burned up as a GM for going full myth and railroading the players in a similar way you described you did when using impro.<br/>It's like, we made the same mistakes with the opposite tools and since then we sorta branded them as poorly suited to fulfill our agenda. At least until we finally got how are they meant to work.<br/><br/>When I found out about the Forge and then started to read about all these dirty hippie games and alternatives to fantasy heartbreakers at first I thought the problem was in the system of trad games. Then I became a fan of impro and incorporating player's ideas, which became a fantastic way for me to keep the game interesting, avoid GM burnout and learn to enjoy the feeling of unknown myself as a GM, play to discover everything along with the players.<br/><br/>It wasn't until 2008 I think, when JD Corley wrote a somewhat extensive analysis of VtM that I started to think the problem was more in how badly people read and interpreted the actual game text intentions. Additional prose, layout and other things definitely got in the middle, but the rules, procedures and advice were there in the core book and still we played the game wrong and blamed it for not working properly.<br/><br/>It happened again when I finally got what a big deal of OSR was about, and realized that if somebody had cared to explain that to me when I got into D&amp;D I probably wouldn't had such a bad experience with it.<br/><br/>Since you started posting about full myth and I got into 5e I started to get myself into that, though I still keep enough of the impro flame in me to still struggle for a middle ground gameplay. I won't talk about my gameplay here, this post is just meant to explain what I saw and from where, which perhaps is similar to whatever happened to some other people here making all of us go defensive instead of actually reading the intention you had behind the other thread.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
