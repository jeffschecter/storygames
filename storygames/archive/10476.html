However, inspired by the bite-sized Actual Play thread, I thought this might be a good way for me to get a little feedback:<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>If you've played the game, write three sentences about your play experience with Archipelago.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nI don't care if you just write three short sentences about your awesome character, or long-winded sub-claused paragraphs analyzing the interplay between social dynamics and subtleties of card interpretation. I'd just love to hear something about how you played the game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
