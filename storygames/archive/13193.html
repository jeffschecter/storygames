I've played some Dogs earlier and now I'd like to play again some, but there is one thing I don't understand.<br/><br/>So there are quite strict rules for the people how to live. If they don't follow the rules, the demonic influence appears. Which means that there is an objective sign if they are moral or amoral. When the dogs arrive they fight the demons and try to make the people live morally. Though it's not the players morality which counts, but the GM's, because the presence of the demons always tells if the people live amoral.<br/><br/>So how do the players have moral dilemmas if the demons tell whether the villagers follow the morality or not?<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>Gabor                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mtsr" title="mtsr"><img alt="mtsr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mtsr">mtsr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297131/#Comment_297131" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-17T08:25:11+00:00" title="October 17, 2010  8:25AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 17, 2010 8:25AM by mtsr.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While the text may not always be clear on that, the GM only interprets morality during preparation, after that, the Dogs are the sole judge of morality. If the Dogs say it's immoral that somebody has a second wife, then it is, no matter what the GM thought ahead of time. So yeah, the GM has some ideas ahead of time about how the morality could be, but in the end only the Dogs count, interacting with the actual NPCs and their goals (including the demons goals). The conflicting goals of all the NPCs should be enough to drive conflict all on it's own.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I played it, the demons never actually showed up, though, our supernatural dial was set fairly low. If it is set higher, yeah, it becomes a little trickier. Just assume there are always demons trying to f* things up and that the Dogs are focusing on only a few of them that have gotten bad enough?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297132/#Comment_297132" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-17T08:36:47+00:00" title="October 17, 2010  8:36AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm pretty sure the relevant moral choices come from deciding how to handle the situation, once we know there are demons afoot. The people affected by the demons are still human beings, and human life is sacred, so the onus is on the Dogs to handle the situation as painlessly as possible.<br/>The mechanics deal with one side of a conflict or the other choosing to up the ante, thus increasing the chance that one side will not walk out of things alive. That is definitely a crisis for the Dogs, as everyone in the community has friends and loved ones, and would be affected immensely by the death of someone they cared about. Villagers, in their suffering and grief, might start doing stupid and sinful things; thus, attracting demons (okay, or maybe the other way around), and thus the Dogs want to minimize the presence of demons by minimizing the presence of death. <br/><br/>It doesn't matter that you know for a fact that someone is demon-tainted; the problem is that it's really complicated to just plug someone in the gut and end things right there.<br/>Does that help?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297134/#Comment_297134" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-17T09:13:40+00:00" title="October 17, 2010  9:13AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I started GMing Dogs recently and had some similar problems with understanding how it was all supposed to work. The "demonic attacks" part of the town setup really throw me off.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: algi</cite>When the dogs arrive they fight the demons</blockquote>\nI don't think this is right. As I understand it, the demons shouldn't be a personified force that can be fought off.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: algi</cite>When the dogs arrive they ... try to make the people live morally.</blockquote>\nI think the trick to situation generation is to make sure that just "living morally" going forward doesn't fix the problem. Somebody's wife still cheated, something has still been stolen, etc. The wound shouldn't go away just because you pull out the knife. My players had a tendency to treat the game like an "investigative game" where the goal was to treat the town like a puzzle and find the root cause of the sin. Things started to work better when I got them to engage with the NPCs emotionally by making them established relationships (either kin, or named NPCs from the relationships set at chargen) or by making them sympathetic, so the players actually wanted to help fix the problems rather than just berate the NPCs for getting into whatever mess they got into. Also, I initially had a hard time with with the "push toward conflict" stuff because I didn't want the NPCs to initiate conflicts with the players to force them to resolve the town's issues the way the NPC wanted. Now, I have the NPCs try to resolve things on their own or try to escalate tension in the town and give the players a chance to get involved if they want, because that tends to prompt the players to start choosing sides.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297136/#Comment_297136" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-17T09:44:15+00:00" title="October 17, 2010  9:44AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like to think about it this way:<br/><br/>Pride and sin are very personal and specific.  A particular person thinks they're better than other people, which leads to them breaking the social norms and pulling other people into sin (either intentionally, or as a reaction to what they do), which is still very personal and specific, and that snowballs until you get false prophets and the demons arrive.<br/><br/>The demons themselves are NOT personal and specific.  They're not into any particular person's suffering so much as wanting to burn it all down and make everyone in the community as fucked up and miserable as they can be.  So they're a big flaming sign that things are very wrong, definitely, but they're not a flashing arrow pointing out where the problem is.  It's up to the PC's to decide what the problems are and how they should be fixed, which isn't always a straightforward task.<br/><br/>Who do you have to kill? Who do you have to make repent? How do you make them do that?  Etc. etc.  The moral dilemma is in the who, what, and how questions.  You know, as Dogs, what you are supposed to do.  But who's responsible and how do you make justice happen?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297137/#Comment_297137" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-17T09:58:36+00:00" title="October 17, 2010  9:58AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 17, 2010 9:59AM by Brand_Robins.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, I'm a Dog. <br/><br/>I come into a town that's gone wrong because two guys are very much in love, and because of that started fucking.

Kill the guys who were going to kill them? <br/><br/>Or, should I make what the gay guys are doing not sin by the simple expedient of saying, as someone with Authority, that they are not sinning so long as they are really in love? <br/><br/>And when their parents won't accept that decision and come screaming at me that I'm a sinner in front of the whole town, possibly giving those who still think it is a sin probable cause to doubt my authority, how do I deal with that? <br/><br/>And when the plotting dudes now want to kill me because I'm doing sin, do I kill them?

That's not very morally ambiguous, but that's ok. The trick is to make sure the root causes are far more sympathetic.<br/><br/>The last town in our recent game involved a girl who had all the qualities to be a great dog, and who wanted the freedom that comes from being a female dog. Unfortunately, the nepotistic steward overlooked her for personal reasons, and decided that his sweet-but-useless niece was going to be a dog instead.<br/><br/>The first girl's grandma knew exactly what was going on, and had no patience for such bullshit. She held a ceremony in which she blessed the girl as a dog. Blammo, false worship! Grandma's a sorceror! She has her demons start sending the girl true visions of evil things going on in the town, so that the false dog can kill the evildoers.<br/><br/>How are the dogs going to deal with all this? Grandma is evil now, but it's hard to blame her for opposing the corrupt steward. There's a nepotistic steward to deal with, but he's not leaving quietly, and are you really going to shoot him over some slightly shady decisions? Most importantly, how do you help the girl, who is the most sympathetic character in this mess, but who is currently in a cult, defying her appointed steward, trying to rise above her place as a woman, and getting help from demons?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297141/#Comment_297141" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-17T10:24:38+00:00" title="October 17, 2010 10:24AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 17, 2010 10:29AM by jenskot.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I do...<br/>\n<br/>\nDemons aren't something you can attack directly if at all. You deal with people.<br/>\n<br/>\nDemons don't control people's minds. They influence. People make their own decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany of these people are your family, friends, and lovers. Make Dog's relationships the main NPCs.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood people do bad things for good reasons. And bad people want them punished.<br/>\n<br/>\nBad people do good things for bad reasons. And good people agree with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople use bad things as justification to do bad things themselves for good and bad reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nVictims bad things may do a bigger bad things in reaction to what was done to them. They didn't invite it and they didn't start it.<br/>\n<br/>\nGod doesn't speak to the Dogs. The GM can't tell the Dogs what is right or wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven the strict rules of the faith have grey areas.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut some people will follow the rules strictly, regardless of their personal feelings. And what the Dogs says is true! There interpretation is right!<br/>\n<br/>\nExcept if 1 Dogs says 1 thing, and another Dog says another, they are both right? How do the Dogs deal with this? How do the NPCs react to that conflict? How do the NPCs take advantage of that conflict?<br/>\n<br/>\nPlant the seeds immediately that it is ok to split the party. Splitting the party means Dogs can form individual opinions. Individual opinions pull away from group consensus. If your cousin did bad things for good reasons they probably want to talk to you in private. They probably want you to advocate for them to the other Dogs.<br/>\n<br/>\nFear escalates. A Dog shoots my neighbor because he claims he conspired with demons, I may not believe them... my neighbor helped raise my family! Or I'm afraid the Dogs are coming after me next! I didn't do anything but I thought my neighbor was innocent to. But if the Dogs say something... it's true. But I don't want to die. Towns are small. Everyone knows everyone. A Dog shoots my father, mother, wife, husband, son, daughter, grandmother, grandfather, grandson, granddaughter, lover, best friend, teacher... things get crazy fast.<br/>\n<br/>\nDogs benefits from multiple sessions. Sometimes morality doesn't come into the first session. People can act like a military unit dealing with objects, not people. But in the next town you can deal with the fallout of their decisions. Explore the consequences. Humanize those "objects". And now you are armed with history! You know what decisions the Dogs made so you can create new situations that challenge those viewpoints. Maybe the person they punished in Town 1 really was a bad person doing bad things. Maybe in Town 2 a different bad person is doing the same bad thing for really good reasons. In Town 3 a good person is doing that same bad thing for good reasons. In Town 4 no one thinks that's a bad thing at all or the person in question is your family, friend, teacher, lover! And as Dogs go from Town to Town they may end up being the person doing the bad thing for the good reasons. Roles can be reversed. And in reflection things don't seem so black and white.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus what the Dogs say goes. Even if someone thinks the Book of Life says different.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297142/#Comment_297142" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-17T10:25:37+00:00" title="October 17, 2010 10:25AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's quite possible by the rules for the Dogs to come to town, everyone runs up and tells them what's going on, they look around and decide, "yep, you brought it on yourselves, nothing to fix here" and ride on.

First of all you have to know that English is not my mother tongue and it's terribly hard for me to find the right words, thatswhy I tend to simplify things thinking that we all read the same book.<br><br>So when I say "fight demons" or "live morally", I think in my head that I'm aware of the nuances of the game, just as you are, but it is much simpler for me to write "fight demons" or "live morally" than to clarify that under "fighting demons" I don't mean punching or shooting a flaming monster with horns. (Although in a quite fucked up town - who knows?) So let's put aside what the game is about. I read the book three or four times, so I asume I read enough about the functioning of the game itself, and it doesn't help to repeat those things. (Or I totally missed the point of all of your posts which is totally possible of course, it happened to me many times.)<br><br>So I try to clarify: Let's take a step back and watch our town from a perspective. We don't see what happens exactly, but we see that things are pretty fucked up. People fucking each other who shouldn't, false ceremonies are held with the best intentions, etc. So, the demons arrive in some sort of influence manifests in a blizzard, the wolves or something like this. The dogs arrive, do something to the town, thay bring totally big differences. The dogs' opinion is that everybody is adequately punished and this is the best solution we ever saw in the history of dogs, which means that for at least a year they will be a totally happy bunch grateful to the dogs, etc. (Yeah, I know, it's impossible, but they still managed to do that.)<br><br>But I look into my papers where I wrote down how the town was created and I see that the specific thing that activated the demons and made the blizzard or the wolves appear is still there. What happenes now?<br><br>1. Does the demonic influence disappear as the dogs decided that it's good?<br>2. Or the demons always stay after brought in independently of how perfect happy bunch the villagers became and had to dealt with seperately?<br>3. Does the demonic influence stay _because_ that specific thing is still there?<br><br>Right now my favorite is number 2, because that means that when creating the village I make the moral decisions but after the dogs arrive I don't make decisions for the demons. And I'd like to think that if the demons are dealt with but the specific cause is still there, than the demons will only appear when they arrive next time to this town.<br><br>How do you like this?<br><br>My problem is: this still would mean that after enough towns, the players will get to know my moral decisions. So the setting is still going to have moral laws introduced by the GM.<br><br>(Btw I'm asking this, because I'd like to use some different setting with more common moral laws, because I wouldn't like to spend the time to explain the players why poligamy is moral AND expecting that they remember everything.)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297167/#Comment_297167" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-17T15:55:09+00:00" title="October 17, 2010  3:55PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What happens is that the Dogs leave and you create the next town, right?

Don't confuse the rules for generating towns for the rules for playing out their judgment.  But for NPC Dogs and ex-Dogs, though, you're totally right.  Definitely more than a few false prophets in their ranks.<br/><br/>I've had PC Dogs roll the Demonic Influence dice, though, definitely.  In this one one-shot I played in, my Dog was a heretic vegetarian who believed animals had souls, and technically a sorcerer in his own right.

Mind you, this is for low-magic "real world" type games.  Demonic Influence is really just a metaphor for Bad Stuff Happening - blight, dry well, sickness.  This is the stuff that befalls every town but since we are dealing with superstition, one thing (Mark and Sally having sex out of wedlock) gets linked to another (the Jones family cattle all dying from a disease) and it gets blamed on demons let in by Mark and Sally's illicit love.  And Sorcerers are simply the bastards who take advantage of a lame situation for personal gain.  <br/><br/>Now, the game sets up an escalation path so that one thing leads to another and sooner or later the demons are able to come in, but really it's just shitty things happening: if your town is sin-free and the well dries up it's a problem to deal with like any other frontier issue, but if you have some false worship going on and the well dries up then suddenly everyone is talking about demons and sin, and Jeremiah the butcher who is taking advantage of people's hardship?  He's the sorcerer. There's no real difference in the situation except for that two things are getting linked together fairly arbitrarily by an angry and frightened populace.<br/><br/>Because of this, what the GM does is make some stuff happen that's bad (dry well in this case, your "demons") and sets up some issues that townsfolk have decided are sins.  It's up to the Dogs to say "yes, Mark and Sally's immoral love is a sin and it needs to be stopped before things get worse" or say "Sally and Mark are pure in their love, and it is Jeremiah the Butcher who needs to be brought to justice for passing false judgement against these lovers."  As I said, all the GM has done is create a problem and put a morally ambiguous thing out there as a possible cause, and it is up to the players to decide which way they go.  The thing to remember is that the answer that the players give IS THE MORAL TRUTH (emphasis mine): if they decide that it is against the teachings of the King of Life to practice love outside of marriage, then that is true for your game.  If the GM sets Dogs up as vehicle for giving a moral teaching, it robs the characters of one of the really cool parts of Dogs which is getting to create (and then be tested) on a morality.  <br/><br/>Oh, right, one other thing.  Once the players have started creating a morality for the game, the GM should test them on it.  If the Dogs have said that sex out of wedlock if immoral and punishable by death, hit them later with kissing, then holding hands, then talking to each other without a elder male guardian present.  The GM should challenge them on their decisions and their morality.  If a Dog says that all thievery must be punished by death, hit them with a father stealing food to feed his family through the winter, and later an 8 year old kid stealing candy and ask them "even now?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297184/#Comment_297184" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-17T20:00:46+00:00" title="October 17, 2010  8:00PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 17, 2010 8:02PM by noclue.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: timonkey</cite>I wouldn't be surprised if another Dog pulled out his gun and shot him in the head immediately, in front of the entire town.</blockquote> Oh, that can totally happen too!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

I'm talking about the stuff that happens in play between Dogs and NPCs, and between Dogs and Dogs. Like when one Dog thinks the greater good would be to overlook the shopkeep's pride and make them the new steward and another Dog shoots them in the head immediately, in front of the entire town. Like the entire town. Like little children who grow up thinking what about these watchmen that come into their town every so often and shoot each other in the head? Maybe they think the Dogs don't know fuck all about right and wrong...oops, false doctrine. So now you've got a Dog shooting another Dog (one of them probably sinned a little) and then a kid becoming a sorcerer.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cathexis</cite>Mind you, this is for low-magic "real world" type games.

When I run dogs with the supernatural dial turned up, in the back of my head I remind myself that maybe the Demons are just shared visions that the Dogs buy into. Or maybe they're really there, but merely big powerful bastards without any morality attached and the Dogs rituals are just power that they've decided to ground in their beliefs. I don't decide that this is so, I just hold the possibility in my head that the Dogs can be staring in the face of possessed sorcerer spitting balefire and smoke, and you still can't say if their right about shooting your dad in the head.

Everything there is purely to create a fucked up town that will lead to fun play in the moment. The demons, the sins, etc., all that is flavour to help you create that setting, but they aren't necessarily real (even in the game).<br/>The players arrive in the town, they interact with the npcs and the problems you throw at them (where 'interaction' often escalates to shooting), and then they leave. When that happens, the town prep has served its purpose. The players will have made some decisions and will have judged the town, and so you go to the next one.<br/><br/>It is within your right as GM to decide that this town will have further problems as a result of what happened or didn't happen here, but you do that by going through the town creation system again, incorporating these events into the history, and deciding how the sin creeps back in. Then the players get to judge it all over again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297204/#Comment_297204" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-18T08:04:20+00:00" title="October 18, 2010  8:04AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's the way I look at it:<br/><br/>The demon's attacking -- whether it's a blizzard or a drought or wolves or raiding Indians, whatever -- that's just <i>shit happening</i>, because shit happens.

In a community where there isn't any underlying tensions or friction, the people pull together and struggle through without things getting out of hand. The Dogs aren't really needed in this case. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut small communities on the frontier will often be brewing some underlying human tensions and distrust (horny teenagers are sneaking off and slacking their duties or I think the shopkeeper is charging me more than that other family for the same goods, etc.) If nothing else bad happens, usually the Steward can manage to fix things himself, and again, the Dogs aren't usually required to bring things under control.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, if bad shit hits a community harbouring suspicions and simmering resentment, the people won't (or can't) pull together, and instead look for someone or something to blame (including each other and "Demons"). And then things can start to get out of hand and the community will eventually pull themselves apart -- especially if there is someone taking advantage of the situation to further their own agendas or beliefs (i.e. a Sorcerer) which will only make the situation worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's my interpretation of why during Town Creation the Demons require some Sinnin' before they can take hold -- if there isn't Sin (and everything that brings along with it) somewhere, there isn't a wedge to drive the community apart, and it never gets that bad. Nothing supernatural from our 21st century point of view, but that's not necessarily how the characters involved see it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lin_fusan" title="lin_fusan"><img alt="lin_fusan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lin_fusan">lin_fusan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297214/#Comment_297214" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-18T09:26:28+00:00" title="October 18, 2010  9:26AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I saw the Demons as simply a more aggressive tool for the town's sins.

If you take 6c to be the same, then the Dogs' approval doesn't count for anything.  i.e. Their moral judgment doesn't affect the situation in this case.  <br/><br/>Usually, the Dogs judgment does have an effect, but it is adding to or elaborating the GM's moral judgment.  i.e. The GM decides that something is wrong, but doesn't specify what the solution is.  So the PCs can accept what was wrong, but add to it what the proper correction is.  <br/><br/>The tricky point is what if the players don't agree with the GM's judgment. The second example town, the Whitechurch Branch, is a good example because there is no blatant wrongdoing (i.e. killing babies to restore one's fertility, say).  The example GM's decision is that Artax's niece is rejecting the Steward's son for "no good reason" - which constitutes Pride, leading to Injustice and further problems.  However, what if the Dogs come in and say that no one is doing anything wrong?  That the niece's decision is a fine personal choice, that the Steward's son is just having a youthful crush that he will work through on his own, and that the shopkeeper is just engaging in his trade.  Does this mean that there aren't any demons?  Are the demons retconned away, or do they simply cease to act once the Dogs make their judgment, or do they stick around and continue to operate?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lin_fusan" title="lin_fusan"><img alt="lin_fusan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lin_fusan">lin_fusan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297234/#Comment_297234" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-18T11:06:34+00:00" title="October 18, 2010 11:06AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Isn't the Dog's decision on how to address Demons part of "giving the morality" to the players?

The GM isn't to have anyone with authority IC (like God or Angels or Prophets or shit) judge the Dog's choices in a way that is morally above the Dogs in the fiction. <br/><br/>But as GM I tell players all the time "Your Dog is a fucking psycho and I hope he dies." I also say shit like "Yea, he doesn't like you and thinks you're a fuckbat, mostly because I think what you just did was fuckbat." <br/><br/>GMs are gonna judge the fuck out of what the Dogs do. The thing is that you can't ever tell them IC that they were wrong or have God tell them to knock it off or anything like that. <br/><br/>So really, I think the whole "look how the town is gone to hell since last time you were here" is going to depend a lot on the group and the tone. If you are doing it to be like "Stupid Dogs look how bad you were" then don't. And if your players are going to read it that way, then don't. But if your group is going to be like "Oh shit, yea, I want to know if Sister Mable was able to stick to the straight and narrow when I told her she couldn't kiss girls anymore, I totally thought that was fucked up and wasn't actually going to work..." then go for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297279/#Comment_297279" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-18T15:38:51+00:00" title="October 18, 2010  3:38PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 18, 2010 3:44PM by Brand_Robins.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>Does this mean that there aren't any demons?  Are the demons retconned away, or do they simply cease to act once the Dogs make their judgment, or do they stick around and continue to operate?</blockquote>\nOh, on this point, my answer has always been that the demons go away once the tensions in the town go away. Cause I don't play demons, I play the town -- the demons are just the manifestation of inner tensions in an external way. <br/><br/>So I've never been a big one for Dogs coming in, saying "This is all fine" and riding out again. Just because I know that Brother Eli doesn't suddenly become alright with what his daughter is doing with Mary Beth just because the Dogs said it was okay. Sure, maybe the demons aren't coming from the girls anymore, but Eli is still full of rage and likely to do something about it. <br/><br/>So if the Dogs say "this is fine" and go to ride out of town I say "Dandy, but just as you're on the way out Mary Beth comes running up and tells you Eli is about to kill his daughter." <br/><br/>The Dogs can ride away if they want, I guess. But its never yet happened. <br/><br/>If the Dogs do deal with Eli, however they do it, and everyone at the table buys that there is no more tension in the town because everyone is 1) repented, and/or 2) forgiven and/or 3) broken to the will of the church/town/god and/or 4) dead -- then there are no more demons. Not because I give a shit about the demons, but because there is no more tension in the town. <br/><br/>Nothing internally wrong enough to fuck people up = no demons. Poof, magic. But as long as there is enough wrong enough to fuck people up... someone gets hurt. Doesn't matter what the Dogs say, really, if no one at the the table believes it. <br/><br/>So the real moral angle in my games really comes from a question of "what is your character willing to do to maintain peace in a place where the social code is a repressive religious one and that and a gun is the tools you've got." The demons go away when we believe that you've maintained (or restored) the peace, and not before.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/algi" title="algi"><img alt="algi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/algi">algi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297325/#Comment_297325" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-19T04:16:04+00:00" title="October 19, 2010  4:16AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, now I read again the setup phase and it makes more sense. The demonic attacks are tightly linked to "sinning." Sinning is a very explicit thing, not like pride or injustice, which can be a bit subjective. So demons arrive when people sin and the want the sin to become habitual.<br/><br/>So it's totally fine to kill all the sinners, and the demons will go away, as they can't make a sin habitual that is not there. (Except there are sorcerers and possessed ones in which case I'd say the actually manifested demons and sorcerers stay until they're "subdued".)<br/><br/>But I don't think simply killing all the sinners and riding out of town should work without giving the Dogs a hint that there will be sinning again, so the town should react at once. (Maybe not even by an NPC telling the Dogs what's going on, but rather a narration of events that the Dogs don't know about.)<br/><br/>And thanks, everyone, for the help.

Demons would just prey on everyone without that protection. One sinner puts the whole town in jeopardy.<br/><br/>Pride and its manifestation, Injustice, doesn't break that protection. Sinning does.<br/><br/>So sins are relatively well defined and explained to townsfolk as a set list of dos and don'ts that they learn through childhood and are reminded every Sunday. Usually, a sinner knows he or she is sinning, or at the very least acknowledge that she is sinning according to official doctrine.<br/><br/>Dogs' word becomes doctrine. So, indeed, a Dog can come and say it is no longer a sin for a woman to have multiple husbands, or for two men to love each other romantically, and even marry.<br/><br/>This doesn't seem to happen too often though. And with good reason. NPC Dogs (and hopefully PC Dogs) realize the huge responsability they carry, and the ramifications of their actions.<br/><br/>Why does the King of Life not like women with multiple husbands,and why doesn't like homosexuals? I don't know. Personally, I don't think He cares too much really. I think it's really choices He made for the community to work. Possible even the King of Life never make any of these calls Himself. Maybe He just gives His protection to every town deemed worthy according to the rules set by the Prophets and Ancients, and the Dogs.<br/><br/>It makes sense. You need a community to strive in the wilderness. You need it to be strong. So you need to have clear leadership. A steward, fine. But within the family? Married men over everyone else makes sense, because they will tend to be most involved in the business of the community (as they are working, are more experienced than unmarried men, have more energy than elderly men, and don't tend to be pregnant all the time).<br/><br/>You also need the community to grow, and grow fast. Produce a lot of children. How do you make that happen? By intending men and women to marry young (except if they're Dogs, then they got other responsibilities, and can't be expected to raise family YET), you allow Steward to marry, you make sex a sin out of wedlock, you make all sex virtuous inside of wedlock, you make homosexuality a sin, and you allow men to have multiple wives if they can carry the financial burden of her and her offspring. You don't allow women the same. It wouldn't produce more offspring, and could lead to less, perhaps, if it leads to some women not getting any.<br/><br/>In any case, it also had to be a doctrine that the people could buy into, so the rules couldn't be too progressive for it time, of some of the Faithful would have left the faith, or never would have joined in the first place. <br/><br/>Maybe a Dog can say some sin is no longer a sin. It used to be, but not anymore. That would be a spectacular event. I think most other Dogs, as well as the Prophets and Ancients of the faith, would take pause, and try to accept this as fact. They know that Dogs aren't actually infaillible, they know they can sin, but they are also in no authority to judge. So they might just accept it. <br/><br/>But its unlikely. Some other Dog will eventually contradict the first. It wasn't a sin before, even though it used to be, and now, it is a sin again.<br/><br/>That would be bad. The Dogs, the Prophets and the Ancients of the Faith may never find an agreement, they would be divided, leading potentially to a schism in the faith, and a weaker community. <br/><br/>The sinning may be over, because it is no longer a sin. But because the social structure wasn't made to handle gender equality, homosexual couples or multiple husbands, it might create some unbalance, pride and injustice. This will not yet attract demons, but may lead to further sinning.<br/><br/>Of course, this may be the darkest secret of the Prophets and Ancient of the Faith. Possibly, the Dogs don't even know about it. If they had made it so that nothing was a sin, ever, the protection of the King of Life would hold everywhere, all the time. The demons would never come.<br/><br/>But you'd have crapsack towns, and no one with the moral authority to anything about it. They use the demons as the stick to keep people in line.<br/><br/>And I don't personally believe the Dogs have the authority to change that. It makes no sense. I believe the the A&amp;P of the Faith have authority over the big picture, while the Dogs worry about the specifics of each town. A Dogs discover a virtuous homosexual couple, and declare it to be so. With Ceremony, that's important. Throwaway statements don't count as Moral Truth. And they send word to the A&amp;P about it. They will eventually decide whether to make the exception the rule, but probably they won't. Possibly, they will prepare a new document relating the stories and decrees of Dogs. Maybe that document will be called \u201cActs of Dogs\u201d (... Well I think it's funny, okay?)<br/><br/>Also, maybe one or several of the Dogs will decide for themselves, that the conditions have changed, and the rules must change as well. Affter all, we're pretty much settled now. Maybe we can make a few less babies per village, if it means a few more women and queers are happier, and we can demonstrate the community is not harmed, or that it can take it. Gathering evidence to demonstrte this to the P&amp;A would be a long term objective in the campaign.<br/><br/>The Dogs can't just come into a town, sanctify it right away and move on. That doesn't work. It's sloppy. In order to declare an instance of sinning is not actually sin, you need to know about it, to be aware of the details, you need to investigate. You also need to go through to the roots of the problem, the underlying pride, and fix the injustice. If you don't, it'll just lead to more sinning in the future. <br/><br/>They also have to make sure the social order will be able to support the change. If you allow one woman to have multiple husbands, that's cool. It's no longer a sin, no longer attracts demons. But this will lead to jealousy. Other wives wanting multiple husbands, husbands not wanting to share their wives. The Faithful may accept that this case is different, but not understand why. You've opened a can of worms. A lot of Pride, Injustice and Sinning may come from that one call you made. If and when you come back, you'll have to deal with it, and fix the mess you made. And try not to contradict yourself. See, there is still one person in the world who can actually say you were wrong, and that is you.<br/><br/>If a Dog is being sloppy, it is his or her own damn fault.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297669/#Comment_297669" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-20T13:49:55+00:00" title="October 20, 2010  1:49PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread really makes me want to play/run Dogs again.
