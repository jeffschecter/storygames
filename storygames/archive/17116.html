In a longer game, there's time for a player to balance both roles. In convention scenarios, I think it makes sense to give each player just one role, but I've found that playing only a Civilian isn't satisfying in a one-shot context.<br/><br/><b>New Rule: Snap out of it!</b> After a one-on-one conversation, a Civilian can roll their Trust with a Professional. For every die that comes up 4-6, both characters recover 1 Nerve; for every die that comes up 1-3, both characters gain 1 Stress for the relationship.<br/><br/><i>When a Civilian trusts someone, they can put their feelings on the line to get them the extra push they need.</i><br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
