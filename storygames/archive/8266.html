This month, it was at Guardian Games.  A group of us from Seattle got ambitious, and daytripped down.  We decided to make a day of it, and organized a pre-event gathering so we could do even MORE story gaming.  And I decided this would be the perfect time to bust out my brand new Mouse Guard PDF and run the game through its paces.<br/><br/>Players were Brendan, Johnzo, Kristian, Nick, and Jackson, with myself as GM.  A slightly larger than recommended patrol, but it seemed to go fine.<br/><br/>I handed out the pregenerated characters, and each player picked one.  Those players who had Beliefs that cited characters that were not present had their Beliefs modified to to someone who was.  For example, Saxon was now best friends with Sadie.  The characters were:<br/><br/>Brendan: Sadie<br/>Kristian: Quentin<br/>Johnzo: Saxon<br/>Nick: Sloan<br/>Jackson: Dain<br/><br/>Dain was the patrol leader.<br/><br/>A few players had had some prior Burning Wheel experience, but most had not, so we went over the basic mechanics, and I pointed out where MG differed from BW.  We also went over the basic mission structure, the GM Turn vs the Player Turn.  I described how Traits worked, and the importance of earning checks.<br/><br/>I was only planning to run Deliver the Mail (with some alterations) but Kristian and Brendan need to run to the store, and the other players were eager for a trial run, so I quickly switched to Find the Grain Peddler for the reduced patrol.  I pitched it as the last mission of the Fall.  So Dain, Saxon, and Sloan went in pursuit of the peddler.<br/><br/>We did it with a quick pathfinding test, which Sloan passed, thanks to some helping dice from her patrol.  This produced some nice roleplaying as Sloan bragged about her tracking abilities, and reacted petulantly when the older mice pointed out clues to the trail that she had missed.<br/><br/>They then questioned the craven peddler, while Saxon tossed the grain cart, and came up with the map. I'm not sure but I *think* he failed his roll, and so I got to use the "you succeed but with a condition" rule.<br/><br/>Aside: Brendan had set up his laptop to record the session with the intent of using the recording to write up a detailed actual play. So the evidence exists!  I hope he still does this.<br/><br/>The "succeed with a condition" rule is awesome because it lets the GM completely avoid the "failing a test == no forward progress" trap.  Of course they'll find the map, the question is just at what cost.<br/><br/>Just about at this point, the rest of the gang returned so we quickly glossed over the Player Turn. Johnzo used a check to recover as I recall, and somebody else might have done something.  We also quickly went through Artha, er, Rewards for the mini-mission.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182038/#Comment_182038" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-07T23:54:10+00:00" title="December  7, 2008 11:54PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Then we rolled into Deliver the Mail.  I described a quiet winter, and then the return of Spring, and the patrol reassembling.  Those mice that had not been present for the mini-mission were deemed to be returning from their hometowns.  Gwendolyn gathered them together and outlined the mail run.  The players rewrote their goals (we weren't using the exact mail patrol provided in the book, and also writing goals is fun!)<br/><br/>This produced some nice bits of fiction that had an impact later.  Quentin's goal was to deliver some special brandy to his uncle in Dorigift.  Dain wanted to visit his lady love in Sprucetuck, and sing her a song he had composed in her honor during the winter.  And Saxon had the best goal: "find some excitement on this milk run!"<br/><br/>Now I liked the situation for Deliver the Mail, but the obstacles as written didn't grab me.  It seemed like it was set up to get the players to fail on the pathfinding test so they could encounter the far more interesting obstacle of the raven.  Fail indeed.  So I chucked the test, and went straight to the raven as a primary obstacle.  But more on that later.<br/><br/>During the run up to Sprucetuck, I quickly described the visit to each town, and the iconic details of each one, using the descriptions in the book.  Great stuff by the way, really made the setting feel rich, at least for me.  Just before Sprucetuck, they ran into a rivulet of snow melt that had gouged across the path.  While the other mice debated searching for branches and building an improvised bridge, Saxon impulsively insisted on swimming the little stream.  They managed to at least hold him down long enough to tie a rope to him, and then he was off.  Saxon vs the Season!  The season won, and a sodden Saxon finally emerged from the other side of the stream, and tired but stubborn.  Since Dain had helped, I awarded him Angry at Saxon's foolishness.<br/><br/>Then on to Sprucetuck.  We had a little more RP here, a run in with Quentin's nemesis, and then a visit to Llana, Dain's lady love (who Saxon gracelessly hit on <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  This prompted a couple rules issues:<br/><br/>1) In the fiction, they got to have a few hours in a warm burrow with a home cooked meal.  I felt like this should be a recovery opportunity, so I awarded a free recovery test to Dain and Saxon.  I'm guessing this is not kosher by RAW, but what the hey. (Hmm... thinking more about this, in the future rather than a free test, I might offer something like this as an opportunity to buy recovery rolls at Player's Turn rates, rather than free)<br/><br/>2) Jackson wanted a quick scene for Dain where he went for a walk with Llana and sang her his song.  This was definitely a personal scene, non mission related, and I felt it should be a Player Turn thing, and cost a check.  But we were still in GM's turn.  So I improvised and said that having that scene was going to cost him his free check in the upcoming player turn.  He was surprised by this, but agreed to it.  This seemed very natural, and it occurs to me that occasional "interleaving" of the two turns for the sake of narrative flow should work just fine.<br/><br/>And okay, on to the raven: on the road to Dorigift I introduced the raven as a stalker, following them from afar, and perching in a tree to spy on them as they ate lunch.  I was intending to narrate them into camp, and then have the raven try to steal the mail in the early morning.  But Nick took me by surprise, and announced that Sloan was going to try to sneak up on the stalker raven, and jump on its back.  Awesome.  Okay, Scout, Sloan's got 4 dice.  Then I pull out the 8 dice for the raven's nature.  Everyone blinks!  Nick immediately taps nature.  The dice are rolled, and successes flow like water.  The poor raven, taken unawares, dive bombs out of the tree with a screaming Sloan clinging to its back.  Saxon whoops and hollers, as the raven is forced down.  Only now they have the problem of getting Sloan off the raven.  After all it's easy to ride the tiger/raven, it's the dismount that is the bitch!<br/><br/>Dain makes a loremouse roll to communicate with the raven, and convinces it that if it settles down, they'll get the annoying mouse of its back.  So Sloan is retrieved.  But what's this, the raven demands a GIFT for its trouble.  That shiny flask of brandy tied to the outside of one of the mailbags.  Things quickly spiral out of control, with Saxon waving his sword around, Quentin trying to save his precious brandy, and the raven hopping around screaming "I WILL HAVE MY GIFT!"  And... Conflict!<br/><br/>From my perspective, conflict was a total win.  The team rules are excellent, and really make everyone pull together.  We had a few rules miscalls, for example we had two mouse teams, and I let mice on one team give help to mice on the other team, which I think is not allowed.  Also somehow I had gotten convinced that when you doubled tapped your Nature, you rolled Nature dice and then added your flat Nature as additional successes.  Now I think that's not right, but I must admit the book is a little foggy in how it expresses this.<br/><br/>So perhaps they had a slightly easier time of it than they should, but that's okay because they nearly got their asses handed to them anyway.  Team A, Sadie and Dain, whose goal was "subdue the raven" got knocked out of the fight.  And a well timed feint by the raven nearly did in Team B (protect the mail).  But at the last minute, somebody went all in with Nature, and managed to clobber the raven, although they were left with precious few disposition.  Sadly I cannot remember the identity of our hero (I want to say Quentin/Kristian).<br/><br/>So raven is driven off, but major compromise.  I offered: "the mail is dirtied and soddened, and the raven gets away with one piece (but not the flask)".  Kristian counter offered: "All the official mail is intact, but the raven gets away with the flask."  Win!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182039/#Comment_182039" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-07T23:54:18+00:00" title="December  7, 2008 11:54PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unfortunately at this point we had to pack up and move on to the next venue, so we again had a hurried Player Turn.

In Bliss Stage, people can get shot during Interludes, but those scenes have a different feel to them from going on missions.  Most of that seems to hold for Mouse Guard as well, though there does seem to be the option that players can follow their own interests towards things that are just as interesting, exciting, and dangerous as the mission during the Players' Turn, which isn't quite true in Bliss Stage.  In MG, at least as far as I've read so far, the player-directed portions don't necessarily have to equal "downtime," though they can.  However, as in Bliss Stage, the GM gets to call up the next mission partially to prevent abuses of downtime that would otherwise allow players to improve their characters situation without having to make any real decisions or do anything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182144/#Comment_182144" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-08T11:03:51+00:00" title="December  8, 2008 11:03AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't make me dust off my copy of Universalis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182153/#Comment_182153" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-08T11:35:38+00:00" title="December  8, 2008 11:35AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel bad that the Player Turn got short shrift not once, but twice.  But then after the fact I discovered we'd only been playing for two and an half hours, so we really got alot done.  I think in the future I would be open to a quicker turn around between GM Turn and Player Turn.  For example, in Sprucetuck I could have switched over to a Player Turn (which would have made the recovery and song issues moot) and then back to GM Turn for the road.  In that case, I'd consider keeping earned check available if not used in a player turn, and only clear the slate at the end of the session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182160/#Comment_182160" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-08T11:55:18+00:00" title="December  8, 2008 11:55AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've found that Players Turns should be at least half as long as GM Turns.

It's not much; they fight for a few panels, the mouse hoots at the owl, and then the owl hoots back.  The mouse explains to the other mouse that the owl said "This ends in death," and then the fight continues.  So, it seems like at least some of the non-mouse/weasel animals are intelligent, but they speak their own languages and aren't inclined to deal or bargain even when they can understand you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182172/#Comment_182172" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-08T12:34:44+00:00" title="December  8, 2008 12:34PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 8, 2008 12:35PM by rafial.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jackson tegu</cite><br>i really liked combat though, the splitting the party into two units so that the situation is always one-bad-group-vs-two-good-groups is totally genius.<br>and the paper-rock-scissors thing is cool, too; i put that idea into a game and it was really fun as well.</br></br></blockquote>\nActually, the GM can have multiple teams too, if he has enough NPCs.
