The player was my wife's brother, Fran\xe7ois, who's also a long time gamer and rpg addict like myself but with a mainly world of darkness and french mainstream RPGs background. Those interested in my background or in the RBH can see my last playtest thread <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4838&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>The game started around 10:30 PM, after our wives and children went to sleep. I already had Fran\xe7ois hooked on playing a warrior during the afternoon so the character creation and main rules explanation only lasted about 15 minutes. Play started after I wrote down some NPCs names and I took 2 minutes to calm my anxiety down in a no-mind way (did I mention the fact that I am an anxious person ?). I speak more of the way I improvised through this game and how it went story-wise in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5044&amp;page=1#Item_1" rel="nofollow">another thread</a>. In this one, I'll concentrate on the RBH rules stuff. Let me just tell that it was a wonderfull two hours game.<br/><br/>Like last time, we rolled some very weak attributes before a (more than) decent character came out. I am divided about this attributes rolling issue. The fact that you sometimes have to roll a lot of times seems weak, but I like the diversity of attributes it gives once the rolls are high enough.There's some flair in the fact that you have to run with the unoptimised point repartition you rolled. Another possibility would be to have a fixed set of attribute (say +5 / +4 / +2 / +1 / +0 / -1 or +4 / +4 / +3 / +2 / +1 / +0 or something else ) and to assign (randomly ?) those numbers to the attributes. I don't know.<br/><br/>Concerning the attributes definition issue I had in the last game : I didn't want to have problems to associate the characters actions with the attributes, like in the last game. So I used the 6 attributes from the first version of the game (the PDF) and not the ones Eric suggested in one of his blog entries. Their are more classic and perhaps less colorfull but I had a better grasp on them. This time, the non combat attributes came into play more frequently and in a less contrieved manner. Fran\xe7ois bossed a NPC with "charisma", he used "wits" to mutilate the body of the bad fairy knight and fool his comrades into believing that the big lizard monster was the killer, etc...<br/><br/>Like Jerome's in the last game, Fran\xe7ois chose the Armor of Scars talent for his PC. 8 hit points instead of 5 has a lot af appeal as a starting talent for a warrior.<br/><br/>Fran\xe7ois asked for a horse because he wanted to play the wandering knight. As the only way to do this rules-wise is the mystic's Animal Compagnon talent, I let him have his horse but only as color. No combat bonus, no additional loading capacity, etc... But he was glad to have the image of the horse. And so it was...<br/><br/>During the game, I felt like I had a better grasp on the arenas rules and on the monsters. And the two were linked.<br/><br/>The monsters : I had thought a lot about the monsters after my last game and I came to this one with thougher beasts :<br/>- good armor : when the monster has a good armor, it forces the player to go for the "awesome tokens" with some bold stunts descriptions and then to make few but powerfull attacks. Results : the fights don't drag indefinitely with one-hit-point-loss-attacks and you have great stunts descriptions. And that rocks.<br/>- special ability that uses the arenas rules : there's a monster power that allows the beast to terrify the PCs and send them running in the next arena. I made a great use of this one and bossed the character around the map. In return, the player tryed his best to come back in his best arenas and the descriptions were all the better. Next game, I'll try another ability I thought about : "Hit and run".<br/>- good attacks : constant monster whiff sucks because the sense of danger falls flat on his back. Besides, being the GM, you don't want to use the stunts rules and steal the player's spotlight. My monsters had all a +2 bonus to hit. But this one was a bit lame because there was no variation during the fight. One player of the first game, J\xe9r\xf4me, suggested something else. A pool of "threat tokens" that the GM could spend like the players "awesome tokens" but without rolling for stunts and with a limited budget for the game. You can even imagine that each monster has a "threat level" limiting the number of tokens spent in a given fight round. I'd like to give this idea a try next time.<br/><br/>The arenas rules are great when you use them. The player had two different weapons with a bonus in different arenas. When he expected the fight to run in one particular type of arena, he took the weapon with the best bonus and tried to stick to this arena or to arenas of the same type. When he was caught flat in a unfavorable arena he ran for the next favorable one. He did not change weapons during a fight but I wonder what I would have done. Spend an action to change ? Somehow it seems lamer than moving around the arenas... So 2 actions to change ??<br/><br/>I still have some problems with the treasures. I think that the rules don't reward them enough. If there's only one treasure in the adventure, 5 xp for the treasure is not enough incentive when you know that a monster is at least 20 xp. Specially if you consider stealing the treasure like an adventure in itself and not the byproduct of killing a monster. Let me explain : the rules say that a monster is a creature that do bad things to people. OK ? So, the lions garding the treasure are not monsters. They are worth 0 xp. They are a part of the danger of stealing the treasure. Like the traps and such. And all that should be covered by the treasure xp reward. But perhaps, I make a too strict reading of what a monster is.<br/><br/>Having made a better use of the rules than the first time, I am even more convinced that the RBH is a great game with a lot of promises. It has the tactical flair some d20 games search but much much simpler and without being a minis game. And it has those wonderfull imagination rewarding mechanics with the stunt rules. I am glad that Eric came back to writing for this game,  like he said on the RBH blog and I would like to see more people playing it and having a great time with it. Go, Eric !                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113770/#Comment_113770" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-12T10:32:32+00:00" title="December 12, 2007 10:32AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Hiya Antoine!  Another excellent AP report.  Thank you very much.</p>\n<p>Most of the stuff you bring up is stuff that, as you know, is stuff we've gone over before and I'm in the process of repairing.  Here's a quick review of that stuff.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Attributes.  The old ones didn't have the flavor I wanted and the new ones weren't easy to get a grip on.   </li>\n<li>Monsters need cooler powers.  More oomph.  </li>\n<li>Treasures are under-valued (Did we go over that before?  If not, that's ok, because I totally agree with you.)  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The attribute spread</strong><br/>\nI understand and respect your opinion on the random attribute spread.  But I'm going to stand firm here.  I like the randomness of it all.  A PC doesn't need good attribute scores to be awesome in this game.  If you had a character with zeroes in every attribute, you'd still rock the house.  If you have even one attribute at +3 you kick ass.</p>\n<p><strong>Mounts</strong><br/>\nI spent a lot of time thinking about mounts and mounted combat for this game.  And the more I thought of it, the less I wanted to include anything for it.  I kinda like the idea that the RBH universe doesn't have any riders.  But, if you really wanted to have something that would be cool for mounted combat, may I suggest drifting the "2 Things at Once" ability of the Footmen.  Instead of being able to run all the time just because you're trained for it, you can run all the time because it's not your legs you're using.</p>\n<p>Also, the horse as color is exactly what I would have done.</p>\n<p><strong><em>"Spend an action to change ? Somehow it seems lamer than moving around the arenas... So 2 actions to change ??"</em></strong><br/>\nWait... what?  What are you talking about changing here?  Weapons?  Yikes!  Well, after double-checking my copy of the PDF, I see that I totally neglected to talk about what kinds of things are allways <em>free</em> actions.  Changing weapons is always free.  Or were you talking about something else?</p>\n<p>I'm probably just a couple days away from publishing the new version of the rules.  I'm pretty excited about them.  I think they're 100% better than the first version.  Now, I can't promise that every change will be exactly what you and your group are looking for.  But I can tell you that none of your comments, compliments, or complaints about the system went unheeded in this revision.</p>\n<p>Thanks again for the excellent actual play report.  Keep an eye on the blog, as I'll be posting up the new rules set as soon as I'm done with it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113775/#Comment_113775" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-12T10:41:05+00:00" title="December 12, 2007 10:41AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 12, 2007 10:42AM by Eric Provost.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Antoine,</p>\n<p>If you were to give this game a different name, a French name, what would it be?</p>\n<p>Edit:  Wait.

Well, after double-checking my copy of the PDF, I see that I totally neglected to talk about what kinds of things are allways<em>free</em>actions.  Changing weapons is always free.  Or were you talking about something else?<br/></blockquote>\nIf changing weapons is free, what is the use of Arena (and of Size which allows to move the fight to other arenas to gain some bonus)? Anyone could carry at least light, ranged and reach weapons and select the "good one" depending on the arena they're in; PC with strength a little above average could also add to this an heavy weapon and thus be efficient in any and all arena. No?<br/><br/>The problem is that encumbrance is only measured in term of "heavy" objects/weapons (other weight nothing, with the current rule). Perhaps a way to solve this is simply to consider that 2 "normal weapon" bring as much encumbrance as an heavy object. Hence, if a character wants to be efficient in lots of arena, he has to have a good size; the same characteristic can therefore be used in two ways leading to similar results: having a high size, you can either carry lots of weapons and choose the most efficient depending on the arena you find yourself in, or you can simply drag your opponent to the arena you want. The choices are not completely equivalent: if you choose the 1st you don't have to have the "good arena" around when you fight, but you cannot carry more than all your weapons (no treasure, heavy armor, etc.); if you use the 2nd tactic (using your size to bring the fight where you want), there must be the "good" arena around to bring people in, but on the other hand you only need to carry one weapon and you have room left for other stuff (treasure, armor, etc.). I do think this can be an interesting choice to make for the player.<br/><br/>BTW, why the "different name"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113852/#Comment_113852" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-12T14:46:24+00:00" title="December 12, 2007  2:46PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 12, 2007 2:47PM by Eric Provost.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jerome,<br/><br/>Thanks for chiming in.  <br/><br/>See, the idea is that your character isn't supposed to have more than two different weapons.  Check out the third paragraph on page 5.  <i>"Write down a primary weapon and a secondary weapon for your character, then pick an armor class for them."</i>  That means your character has an advantage in two different arena types, not in all of them.<br/><br/>The version I'm working on right now will make that initial weapon choice even more interesting.

I can't wait to read the new rules. You know that all my speculations were a way to pass the time while waiting for you <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I agree that the game is not just a D&amp;D hack anymore. And It's realy an honor that you ask me a name for the game. Even if you don't take it in the end. I just love to search for titles. I am a bit long at the task but I can't stop till what I found realy "click" in my mind and feel like the last piece of a puzzle coming into place. My imagination is already rolling free-wheeled.<br/><br/>Concerning some points of rules :<br/><br/>- the random attributes : I can totaly see your point and in fact, I realy love the diversity in  characters the randomness gives. If J\xe9r\xf4me agrees to GM, I think I'll go with the first character I roll. It goes well with the five-levels-only-then-retire-and-play-again philosophy.<br/><br/>- the weapon change : the free action totally makes sense if the two weapons only is a hard rule. Besides, I suppose than everybody will have a favorite weapon, be it because of a synergy with the talents or just that they dig the specific bonus it gives. So I suppose I don't have to worry about that.<br/><br/>Now, I'll go and refresh your blog every 5 minutes until the end of the week.<br/><br/>Best,<br/>Antoine                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
