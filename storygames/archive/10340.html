I'm not sure if this is a bad thing, exactly... our game was definitely on the high side (I think there were maybe two scenes without Obstacles, and one of them was the very last), but we kind of set ourselves up to go in that direction with the fairly explosive secrets the characters were hiding from each other.<br/><br/>I'd say that if people are consistently creating awesome imaginary road movies, the game is a success.

"Collection of Bones" is such an awesome trait, and "I will find love amidst the ashes" is one of the best futures ever - it's big, it's poetic, it's not going to resolve itself in a pretty way, and yet it's sincere and noble in its ambition. Rad. All of these characters are good.\n<blockquote>An Obstacle is quickly established: the bartender, seeing all the blood, tries to confiscate everyone's keys before they get onto the road and do themselves even more harm. </blockquote>\nRad. I want to use that as an example if I do future versions of Ribbon Drive. That's such a good example, especially because there are so many ways to overcome it (running away, arguing, distracting him, fighting past him, bolting, stealing the keys back...) and so many ways to detour (paying a new driver, stealing a new car, taking the Greyhound, getting wasted in the bar and heading out a full day later...).<br/><br/>Congrats to Lewis for becoming the protagonist. I like that result. Sometimes the story has someone who could really obviously be the protagonist, but someone else who would be much more rewarding if they did. In this case, the early scenes indicated Chantal playing a focal role, and I'm actually super glad that she wasn't the protagonist.\n<blockquote>I'd say that if people are consistently creating awesome imaginary road movies, the game is a success. It's been about a month since our game and we're still recalling it fondly. </blockquote>\nThere's a brilliant thing that happens to me post-game, when I encounter those "title tracks" again in the real world.<br/>It's wonderful - you get filled with this nostalgia about a trip and a group of people that don't really exist.<br/>Certain songs - <i>"Time After Time" by Cindy Lauper, "Whanana Fuck Shit Up" by Wingnut Dishwasher Union, "Four Winds" by Bright Eyes, "Margaret vs. Pauline" by Neko Case, "Hot Patootie" by Meatloaf, "Westfall" by Okkervil River</i> - I can't hear the same way anymore. They've become possessed by stories (some heartbreaking, some uplifting) that mean a lot to me.<br/><br/>Time After Time is the song that me and my ex-wife made ammends over.<br/>Whanana Fuck Shit Up kick-started our reunion tour.<br/>Four Winds takes me back to the post-apocalyptic time when I joined a ragtag crew on the way to the source.<br/>Margaret vs. Pauline is the story of my violent girlfriend and her lost-in-life friend.<br/>Hot Patootie is about that weekend where we all wanted to get laid and all ended up getting smacked in the face by life instead.<br/><br/>Yeah, I hope that you bump into these songs again, and I hope that they fuck with you somehow.<br/>If you're a twitter user, post about it with <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23ribbondrivenostalgia&amp;Mode=like">#ribbondrivenostalgia</a> attached, and I'll get to share that with you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
