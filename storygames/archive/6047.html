After they "awaken" but before any conflict, I plan on doing a flashback to a briefing room.  At this point they assign abilities, pick a talent, and roll for mentor.  Still no real background on what Blue City is.  I think the flashback would be brought on by Control contacting them and informing that although there appears to have been a glitch at insertion, they are to continue with their mission.   I am going for a Dark City/Matrix vibe where players don't comprehend the true nature of the world in the first act.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Yokiboy" title="Yokiboy"><img alt="Yokiboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Yokiboy">Yokiboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135341/#Comment_135341" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-18T07:26:19+00:00" title="March 18, 2008  7:26AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally I love acting the role of Control and starting the game as soon as the players show up, by calling them Agent <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, etc. until they have established their pseudonyms. I totally force them turn of cell phones and any other electrical equipment, plus they're forced to use Control's (i.e. my) dice until they've graduated Agent training and are put on the slab. However, go with your instincts, play it the way you suggest, but please let us know how it worked out.<br/><br/>Oh, you might not be aware, but <a href="http://erdtman.com/holken/lacuna/" rel="nofollow"><b>you are already playing...</b></a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135349/#Comment_135349" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-18T07:45:11+00:00" title="March 18, 2008  7:45AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mel White posted an actual play recording of a game <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/LacunaRpg" rel="nofollow">here,</a> where the GM throws the players right into it, IIRC.<br/><br/>I pulled the same trick myself, and I'll probably do it again, as it worked pretty well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135411/#Comment_135411" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-18T12:52:05+00:00" title="March 18, 2008 12:52PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was going to say, that's exactly how our game started!  Players and agents knew that the characters had been 'inserted' although we weren't exactly sure of the process.  There was some sort of rough insertion but otherwise we were physically all right.  Having all seen 'the Matrix', we figured it was something like a mental transference.  We soon realized we had no knowledge of what we were supposed to do.  So our Agents were completely ignorant of both things going on in the Blue City and things going on back at base.  We had to hide this fact from Control because we believed Control would do bad stuff to us if they knew...<br/>I really enjoyed the 'blind' opening.  I have a real sense of exploration and discovery going on as the game continues.  Plus, I think the players have a sense that anything is possible--we don't know what the limits are, so we are pushing things.  And, because we don't know exactly how things work, we wound up killing the guy we were supposed to help in the Blue City.
