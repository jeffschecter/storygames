For instance, I'll be out of town for most of next weekend, with minimal time to check the net--that would have been RIGHT SMACK in the middle of some of the key years of play.<br/>-----<br/>Thinking about it... I think that, for DIPLOMACY ONLY, orders every week--including build and retreat--would be about perfect: plenty of time to email or to miss a day or even a weekend; and yet not so slow that the game takes more than a couple of months. For RPGs, I'm finding that even a post a day is WAY too slow (and not enforcable, over months of play) and so I'd probably want a scheduled time to be online, maybe a couple of hours every few days. But Diplomacy turns are, basically, *half a year* apart. It almost suits the "feel" of the game to have ti run at a more sedate pace.<br/><br/>Best of all worlds would be a server/system that supported some kind of "Allow Really Done" toggle, along with orders that can be changed. So I could make prelims, then do some diplomacy and make changes, but when I'm definitely just plain done, I click the "Really Done This Time" button. Once all players click that button, the server would advance the turn, EVEN IF it hasn't been the full week. That would not only allow for sedate play; it would also allow for a flurry of play, when folks are able to communicate and finalize plans faster than the usual pace, for whatever reason (e.g. everyone's online at the same time, killing time at work!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250508/#Comment_250508" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-12T13:10:55+00:00" title="January 12, 2010  1:10PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite><br/>Best of all worlds would be a server/system that supported some kind of "Allow Really Done" toggle, along with orders that can be changed.

It's not as useful as one would hope. You often have one person, unhappy with their fate, who doesn't use the feature out of spite. Then there is, as Mike says, players that don't use it for more understandable reasons. So far I'm really liking the interface of playdiplomacy.com.

Nobody told him that the trick to playing the poor Austria is to defend aggressively, as he doesn't have the luxury of just sitting in place. Russia holds all the cards in their relationship now; in fact, should Italy join in, inspired by Austrian passivity, Austria might even lose a home SC right off.<br/><br/>Then again, Italy is messing up admirably, too. Now A Rom is officially useless for the first year, unable to convoy or operate in the north. Clearly there is a surfeit of suspicion floating around in the mid-to-eastern Europe - how can our heroes survive this situation, with experienced players running both Turkey and Russia?<br/><br/>Par-Bur in France warms my black little heart - perhaps it was inspired by what happened in the last game? Not the ideal move tactically for France when Germany didn't try for Burgundy after all. Now France has to play a guessing game for Brest with England, and England has the luxury of choosing between Norway and Belgium for his first build.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250772/#Comment_250772" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-14T08:15:15+00:00" title="January 14, 2010  8:15AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whassup with the Vienna and Budapest bounce?

In Diplomacy you're always on the track to victory as long as you're still in the game. Now you're all the more dangerous to your opponents after having shed your illusions of fair play and honorable promises so early - you're ahead of the game, in fact.<br/><br/>Everything else on the board makes sense to me, except for the French decision to go to Picardy and the English decision to leave Nth instead of convoying the army. Ironically the combination of moves puts the two into a bind that will only work to cement their alliance: now the only way to prevent Germany from taking Belgium as well is for those two to cooperate until England can get new fleets into the scene. Terribly inefficient play from England, but of course he'll make it up with the two new fleets, which should provide him a dominant position on the northern seas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250969/#Comment_250969" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-15T04:21:21+00:00" title="January 15, 2010  4:21AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Being perceived as dangerous and capable of doing less than efficient moves that hurt my opponent more than they help me gives me leverage.<br/><br/>I'm planning on using that to further my goals.

Ultimately, though, my answer can be phrased in a simpler and shorter way:<br><br>If I were asked to play Chess in a foul-mouthed sailor bar on the waterfront, a place where I'm prone to get spat upon and cursed at for doing well in the game - I would not say that the players in that place are playing wrong, I'd just say that it's a play environment in which I don't want to play. Similarly in Diplomacy, in which many play environments have developed towards accepting anything and everything in the negotiations as part of the psych game - they are not playing wrong, I don't think, but they are playing in an uncourteous manner, which I do not need to condone. I want a certain level of decorum from my personal play environment and co-players, even if I do not claim that others are playing wrong by being much more lively about slandering their opposition.<br><br>This is partially an issue of play quality, although not at its core: I might say that it's a more high-level play if I can get you to attack Brest by cleverly framing a convincing strategic argument for it than if I screamed threats at you with spit flying on your order sheet. After all, in the first case I'm displaying superior understanding of the game while misleading you courteously, while in the latter case I'm just browbeating you by acting in ways you might not expect and be prepared for, psychologically. So in that sense we might say that courteous play is more in the spirit of the exercise. However, we might also argue that it's up to the opponent to withstand lively rhetorics, and if it's the local style, then you're expected to make your best play no matter how provocative the other guy gets about your parentage. As long as your communication is within local mainstream you're not getting any advantage or disadvantage from the rhetorical part of your argument anyway, as your target can discount those bits and focus only on the substance of your message. (All of this assumes that the players are not actually breaking the ritual space, mind; if the other guy threatens to slander you in public if you don't do what he says or something like that, then it's obvious wrong and against the spirit of the game.)<br><br>Based on the above, I might say that I myself won't rely on completely insubstantial psychological warfare in Diplomacy. If I want to threaten another player into desisting from a war he's about to open, say, then the core of my argument will concern how his actions throw the victory to somebody else or how they'll doom his own play. I won't try to dissuade the player with meta-game arguments like calling him a monkey and threatening to devote the rest of my game to his destruction out of spite. Facts only, facts backed by the victory and loss conditions of the game, and the presumed common value base that the players share in trying to achieve the victory while avoiding the loss. Any rhetoric aside from that is not stylish to my mind, even if it is rules-legal.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251037/#Comment_251037" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-15T12:16:03+00:00" title="January 15, 2010 12:16PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The server's back up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251039/#Comment_251039" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-15T12:30:15+00:00" title="January 15, 2010 12:30PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find my inability to judge the strategic interests of any one nation, and thus possible alliances they could be forming a pretty big hurdle in trying to talk someone into something and properly judging their intentions.<br><br>Could anyone give me a low-down of what each country is/should be generally trying to accomplish in a game?

This is a generic overview at the beginning of the game:<br/><br/>First, <b>the goal of the game</b>: your goal in Diplomacy is not to score as many SCs as possible. It is, in order:\n<ul>\n<li>Prevent anybody else from gaining a solo victory. Any of the lesser goals hinge on this one, so you never should make actions that go against this primary goal. You'll lose the game if this happens.</li>\n<li>Survive on the board until the end of the game. If you don't, you've lost the game. If you do, you've won the game, and it's just a matter of how well you won.</li>\n<li>Gain a solo victory by taking half of the board yourself. This is the big victory, but it's about as common as winning in poker with a royal flush. Don't try to force it unless you know that you can get it.</li>\n<li>Gain a draw by getting everybody else still in the game to agree to it. You should only try for this when all other outcomes are worse; continuing the game is actually better than accepting a draw as long as you still have a real chance to take a solo or <b>narrow the draw</b>: a draw with less players is better than a draw with more, just like a solo victory is better than any draw.</li>\n<li>Gain diplomatic or tactical position. Diplomatic position means having a better working relationship with the other Powers. Tactical position means having better means of projecting force against others; this latter part usually involves gaining and holding SCs, which is also necessary for a solo victory and for avoiding getting eliminated. This is a strictly utilitarian goal, though, in that both diplomatic and tactical position only have meaning in relation to the above set of win and loss conditions.</li>\n</ul>\nNow, individual Powers and their early-game concerns follow. I'm going to be a bit frivolous here, as this is a major topic - essays have been written and could be of each Power separately. In short:<br/><br/><b>England</b> should encourage other Powers on the Atlantic (defined in Calhamer map strategy as everything this side of Gibraltar, Baltic included) to under-invest in fleets so she can keep her dominating hold and impeccable defensive position. Only Norway is considered a default English SC, for the rest she needs to fight. A mid-term goal is to dominate the Nordic sphere; StP, Swe, Nwy and Den form a natural perimeter area that can be easily held once entirely conquered. Another mid-term goal is to occupy MAO and use the superior position against France at will. Short-term goals involve precision strikes on continental SCs in the Netherlands, preferably with diplomatic goals relating to Germany and France. Only rarely does England go into the end-game by occupying the Netherlands entire with armies and continuing from there to a continental strategy; much more common is for her to dominate the Nordic sphere, break the French hold on MAO and then breach a way into the Mediterranean.<br/><br/><b>France</b> has no superior offensive options, but she has two default SCs in the Iberian peninsula and an equal option on Belgium, which gives her a very good depth of defense and material right from the start. Usual early game goals involve jockeying for position with Germany in the Bur-Ruh area with the Netherlands as stakes, and jockeying with England on the Atlantic with Bre-Eng-MAO as the stakes. An assault on England is possible, but it doesn't get any easier as the game wears on; an assault on Germany is more feasible, but it has to be managed with care so England does not get to benefit too much. An assault in Italy is not a good option, but sometimes it's mandated by the other choices being even worse. Strategically France has no obvious sphere of interest aside from the free-for-all Netherlands; she can even abandon that for the right price. France makes her own way, all told.<br/><br/><b>Germany</b> has a position in the middle of the board, so her mid-term goal is to ensure that she doesn't get caught in a two-front war. This is done by making sure the Tsar keeps his sanity (attacking Germany is stupid, but sometimes Russia is in desperate straits or not thinking straight) and by being decisive in any confrontation in the west. Germany has a stake in the Nordic area, but only rarely manages to dominate it the way England can. In the early game Germany fights for the Netherlands (with perhaps a slightly better position for it than the other two western Powers) and can try out an assault on France, although the latter rarely is very rewarding. Attacking England is an under-appreciated option that can be rewarding in cooperation with Russia. Attacking Austria is usually a stupid move until either France or England has been taken. Hol and Den are considered default German SCs, making her another Power with two nigh-guaranteed early builds.<br/><br/><b>Russia</b> has a priority in making sure she dominates one of her two theaters of war at all times; being forced on the defensive in both at the same time usually proves fatal. In the north the early Russian priority is to occupy Sweden (not entirely guaranteed, as we saw) and discourage an English attack on StP, with unit commitment if necessary. Most Russian players choose to be passive in the north aside from these concerns, but it is possible to build another fleet and claim Norway, especially with German support. After that the next natural move is to try to usurp the English position on the Atlantic, which is a mid-game concern. In the south the Russian play is much more complex: Rumania is usually considered a Russian SC in the early game, but the forces in Balkan are vicious and lots can happen. Galicia is a key defensive position for both Russia and Austria, the Power occupying it will usually have the initiative against the other. The Black Sea is crucial to a Turkish attack on Russia or a Russian attack on Turkey, so it has to be dealt with in some manner as well. The ideal Russian play in the area usually involves claiming the northern half of the Balkans (Vie, Bud, Rum at least) while Turkey claims the southern half; alternatively in an attack on Turkey Russia claims the whole of Turkey while Austria might take the Balkans in whole. In the former case Russia continues to Germany and combines her two theaters into an Europe-wide offensive, in the latter case she'll build fleets and essentially usurp the Turkish role in resisting Italy - unless she chooses to stab Austria, of course, trying to engulf the whole eastern triangle on her own.<br/><br/><b>Austria</b> is more vulnerable tactically than any other Power due to her supremely open position. This also means that she has the best offensive capabilities when she has the initiative. Playing Austria is very much a diplomatic issue, as the "best" moves for her leave her completely open against at least one neighbour; therefore the choice of who to trust is imperative, as is getting at least one ally to try that trust thing on in the first place. Italy, Turkey and Russia are the candidates, the rest of the board does not matter in the immediate opening. Serbia is considered an Austrian SC at the start, but she can feasibly go for Rumania or Greece as well, and usually should - be aggressive, take risks and work on your diplomacy; you'll either die fast or expand quickly. The first stable Austrian position occurs at six SCs when she controls Serbia, Greece and either Rum or Bul; at that point she is likely involved in either mopping up Turkey or allying with a desperate 3-SC Turkey against an overbearing Russia. In the mid-game Austria can also go for Italy, although that is only possible if she has not left fleet development on the wayside.<br/><br/><b>Italy</b> is not as vulnerable as Austria, but she also doesn't have such offensive opportunities. As the saying goes, Italy both wins and loses less than Austria. Tunis is the only SC that is considered indisputably Italian, and an amateur Italy often finds great difficulty in gaining a toe-hold anywhere else. I myself prefer to take Greece with Italy right from the start, and Trieste is also a possibility as we're seeing in this game; however, Italy should know that usually she'll be on the losing side of any splitting of Austria where Russia and Turkey are also involved. After Austria is dead Turkey and Russia will find a new foe in Italy, after all. Thus my dictum: the Italian priority should be to keep both the western and eastern triangles in balance with nobody dying off while Italy herself grows in power. To achieve this Italy can make precision strikes on Marseilles, Munchen Trieste and the Turkish coast; often Italy can't keep hold of these SCs in a feasible configuration, but attacking the right targets can cause force diversions that allow Italy the time she needs to conquer SCs she <i>can</i> hold, such as Tri-Vie-Bud, Gre, Smy-Con or Mar-Spa.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>Turkey</b> usually consider Bulgaria a given at the start and has to fight for the rest. Her position is very similar to England in being defensively superior but limited in offensive capability; the trick to playing this sort of position is to leverage the safe defense by taking on an ally and trusting in her a bit, which risk'll allow Turkey to progress. The easiest SCs to take in this manner are Greece and Rumania; it is typical that after taking either Turkey will either turn against Russia to bid for Sevastopol, or build fleets and try to surprise Italy. Turkey is, however, usually the lesser force on the Med, and thus has to focus on defence against the Italian, who often has nothing better to do than fight for her life against Turkey. Therefore the well-played Turkey seeks the opportunity to betray Austria to gain Serbia (and become a continental power to a degree) or Russia to gain Rumania and Sevastopol.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251063/#Comment_251063" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-15T14:37:11+00:00" title="January 15, 2010  2:37PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's true; there are piles of Diplomacy strategy and tactics essays online.

Heck, I don't read it myself for some reason.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251065/#Comment_251065" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-15T14:45:18+00:00" title="January 15, 2010  2:45PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While I wasn't excited about playing Turkey two games in a row, it is my favorite power, followed by England and France.

Because, obviously, they've a vested interest in not telling me the truth about that (unless they're a western power, which isn't as useful to me at this point, heh).<br><br>For those players who have more games under their belts than I do, this stuff is probably common knowledge - having actually played the country in question, you know what their needs are from experience, and can judge their players better when they come to you with offers. For me, though, that's close to impossible - while I see the map and I see what happens, the layer with the important bits, how alliances build, change, and break, is invisible to me.<br/><br/>Though I think I'm learning fast!

It's not only knowledge of the map, either - the skills are somewhat transferrable between variants, it just so happens that the Calhamer map has been analysed exhaustively due to its primacy.<br/><br/>A good idea for a beginner is to try to figure out which of the other players has the most to win by his success and ask that player for strategic advice. For example, in this situation both Germany and England would benefit from a resilient, reviving Austria, so their advice would be likely to have less strings than that of some others. No idea if those players have advice to give, of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251174/#Comment_251174" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-17T05:24:06+00:00" title="January 17, 2010  5:24AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 17, 2010 5:27AM by DWeird.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And thus Austria falls after a brief and uneventful struggle. I was expecting the German to screw me the way he did, but I assumed that if he's planning to move on me, I'm dead anyway, so decided to try to break out of this circle somewhat and go for Galicia while asking the German to go for Tyrolia. Might have gone for Trieste instead, but that would have only delayed the inevitable and locked me in from all sides with no breathing room at all.<br/><br/>I now kind of feel that Austria's fate was sealed right after that initial goof. Now, another player might have still made it work - but I was not only new to the game, I also had the <i>reputation</i> of being new to the game, and as such, was probably seen as either a drain on resources as an ally or easy pickings as a target. (One of) My own mistake(s) here was that I shut out the turk nearly immediatelly, pushing him into a strong partnership with the russian from square one. Stupid, stupid, stupid, what can I say?<br/><br/>Things I learned:<br/>It pays to display that you're irked at any perceived injustice instead of writing it off immediatelly. That way, you can sometimes get other players to try to appease you if they need you for a move.<br/>"Trust" is bullshit and entirely secondary to good strategic options (basically... a capacity of making mistakes and still surviving, which I lost very early on). However, this will not stop people from talking about trust due to the reason above.<br/>Most games =/= the game I'm playing in. Generalized knowledge of what usually happens doesn't help much in the specific jam one can find himself in.<br/><br/>Anyway, I had fun!<br/>And now that I'm out of the game... I'd appreciate it if those who had to deal with me told me their impressions (if it's something that would compromise your current plans, then make it private, 'course) regarding my negotiation attempts or my choices of moves. There's always room for improvement, but in my case, it's <i>warehouses</i> of it, I'm sure!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251176/#Comment_251176" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-17T05:49:39+00:00" title="January 17, 2010  5:49AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            DWeird!

I especially like the German presence in Vienna, that should prove problematic to everybody - the natural course is for Germany to either give up the SC for tempo advantage, or bring in a considerable force to establish a real presence in the east. I would say more, except there are some far-reaching options, and we'll want to see if you people think them up for yourselves.<br><br>That last Austrian move was rather flashy. The German move was simply lucky (unless Austria gave his plans away to somebody), but the Russian one was expected. As Galicia isn't immediately useful when you go there in the fall, the move would have been of doubtful utility even if Germany hadn't divined a lethal countermove. Italy has also made some interesting choices here, as has England. I won't critique them in depth as the game is ongoing - ask me later if you want to know what seems strange here to outsider eyes. So far it's working quite nicely, at least for Italy.<br><br>The western situation is also dynamic and exciting, there are all sorts of options there. The board does not tell who should ally with whom in an obvious way, so it'll be up to the diplomacy and macro-strategic planning. All western Powers are still very much kicking - in fact, everybody is doing great except for the poor Austrian, whose quick diminishment has boosted everybody else ahead of the curve, some more and some a bit less. (I'd say that the French situation sucks, except that it's nothing that making an alliance, any alliance, won't fix. Whoever he'll decide to ally with should have an edge against the other neighbours of his, so I can't imagine him getting crumbled like an empty juice carton, with everybody else happily cooperating to feed on the carcass. As the neighbours are also under various pressures, France has a chance at an easy come-back against whoever he decides to not ally.)                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251212/#Comment_251212" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-17T17:29:53+00:00" title="January 17, 2010  5:29PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 17, 2010 5:30PM by Brian_Minter.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I enjoy the fact that this game has color commentary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251268/#Comment_251268" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-18T11:33:16+00:00" title="January 18, 2010 11:33AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To those lamenting the dearth of Diplomacy articles written later than 1978 (which might have happened in the first thread):<br/><br/>There's a fistful of them over at:<br/><a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=ah/articles" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=ah/articles</a><br/><br/>I'm not expert enough to comment on their quality, but at first glance they seem passable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251290/#Comment_251290" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-18T16:22:15+00:00" title="January 18, 2010  4:22PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Couldn't Austria move next season to Warsaw and maintain a government in exile?

What a nice alternative to layout work. Let's see...<br/><br/>Oh, the Russian is rolling strong. It's a clash of the titans in Scandinavia as the two leading Powers of Europe determine their relations once and for all! Will the House of Windsor, or the House of Oldenburg reign supreme? After the spring it seems like England should have the immediate upper hand in the north, but if Russia can keep the initiative with clever tactics or at least stabilize a solid defence, she'll surely have a chance to bring more guns to the fray from the StP dockyards. Germany is in a linchpin position, able to play both sides for her own advantage - which she definitely should do, considering her precarious position! Russia might be the initially better ally for Germany geopolitically, but the fact remains that either giant will crush her like a bug, should the northern war resolve definitely and the usefulness of an independent German state come to an end.<br/><br/>France continues to stagnate in her secure position. This is the greatest danger for the French, as the free neutrals and defensible positions make her an unappetizing target for others and an unlikely aggressor. But should she fail to make her mark, sooner or later the war in Europe consolidates a sufficiently large Power on her doorstep, one that can go against her natural five SCs with impunity.<br/><br/>In the south we have Italy fighting for her life; as a wise leader should, Chris has broken off the ill-fated French expedition to set up a solid defense against Turkey. The decision to take the Adriatic Sea might prove surprisingly wise - my own preconceptions concerned a fighting defense with Ion-Eas or similar, but should the war continue unabated for several years, that is sure to be the better move. Meanwhile Turkey holds a solid initiative and will likely continue doing so until and unless the alliance structures shift; until then I'm not foreseeing an immediate catastrophe for Italy nor any danger to Turkey - the prognosis is for a slow Turkish advance against Italian holdings while Italy plays defense and strives to turn the diplomatic situation to her advantage. Just don't let Turkey into the Ionian!<br/><br/>All in all the situation is solid mid-game, almost anything can yet happen. The French strategic goals are still a mystery that can unbalance the situation in many ways. Instability of the German leadership could have a similar outcome, as could a simple lack of fighting spirit in the Italian cabinets.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252278/#Comment_252278" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-23T21:44:22+00:00" title="January 23, 2010  9:44PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 23, 2010 9:45PM by Brian_Minter.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Turk would never dream of entering Italian waters.

It'll slow down the eastern advance for as much as a year, as he doesn't have to disband an army now, and two armies are sufficient to hold the Tirolian corridor with 50/50 odds for a full year, even. That might prove conclusive for him, and for Germany too, as she has to make do with one unit less, leaving her even more dependent on Russia for succor. Now Italy and Germany are both in essentially client-state position, showing us very practically what often happens to a central alliance against the rest of the board after Austria falls. I would have expected that if Italy knew about the French fleet coming to his "aid", he'd have moved aggressively against Turkey to bring the superior Franco-Italian strength to bear. As it is, that French move might have been quite unplanned; interesting to see how Italian diplomacy handles it. Still, one expects clemency - a lone French fleet would be unlikely to gain a very large share of Italian plunder should France choose to split his client with the Turk; and of course, keeping even that small slice after Italian defense crumbles would seem unlikely.<br/><br/>Meanwhile in the big boy's game we see England dominating against Russia - the Russian defense demonstrates starkly the dangers of excessively conservative play, as England gains not one, but two tempo advantages by moving to both Nwy and Nwg with his still superior fleet power. StP is quite concretely threatened, and even as Russia has the material strength to defend it, no further short-term gains against England are to be expected after this. In fact, I'd have played that position even more aggressively as England in all likelyhood - giving up Skagerrak means that he'll just have to take it back later, should he intend to concentrate all of his power against the northern front with France as his ally on the continent. The current position is less draining defensively, but it means that Russia and England are stuck in slow trench warfare for the foreseeable future - which might in turn provide Turkey and France, the second-string Powers, time to develop their musculature and come up as real contenders on their respective allies' flanks.

Consider: England could have moved Eng-MAO and Bel-Eng to mutually mess up France and gain a permanent strategic advantage over the French while making peace with Russia and releasing enough units to take back Lvp. Kudos to the French government for daring. It'll be interesting to see how the northern situation develops after an upset like this.<br/><br/>The Italian situation seems a bit awkward, I'm surprised that he went for a risky plan like that. The northern defense of Venice would hold indefinitely with French support and control of the Adriatic Sea, but letting the Turk progress in the south seems like it'll lessen the chance of a Russo-Turkish fallout quite a bit. Earlier the best Italian option was to hold tight and diplomatize the Turk and the Russian into fighting each other (grinding the whole board to a halt if need be while waiting for the two to get to it), but now I don't quite know... a complex tactical mess, one in which Turkey could make progress. Seems like the situation could still be stabilized by Italy, though, even with Turkey on the Ionian.<br/><br/>Overall I like the quality of the game. Everybody is playing quite well, actually, and nobody is obviously under-matched here. Germany is a bit under the wind, but I could see even her come back if the board gets static.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253836/#Comment_253836" name="Item_128" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T13:32:18+00:00" title="January 29, 2010  1:32PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Early odds in Monte Carlo:<br/>* Three-way Fra/Rus/Tur - 5:4<br/>* Two-way Rus/Tur - 3:1<br/>* England lasts one more year - 5:1<br/>* Italy lasts two more years - 15:1                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253839/#Comment_253839" name="Item_129" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T13:36:12+00:00" title="January 29, 2010  1:36PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I suspect Willow is merely biding her time.

Spa-Wes is the move that juts out the most to my eye; I'd have expected France to hurry to loot the English before the Russians get there. Perhaps the French have concluded that their Italian allies can't be relied on to defend themselves. the loss of Venice certainly seems to back up that supposition.<br/><br/>The endgame is clearly visible at this point, as can be seen in the straining Russo-Turkish relations. There are still quite a few players on the map - so many that only the French can really match the Russians as any sort of counterbalance, the rest of the board being fractured. It seems to me that the Russians are in no hurry to race to the finish, though, which means that many of the smaller Powers might well choose to cooperate with the Tsar for a while, yet. Much will depend on timing and perceived timing in this game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255716/#Comment_255716" name="Item_144" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T08:24:42+00:00" title="February  9, 2010  8:24AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Spring 1907 is here:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-15890-12-R.png"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255720/#Comment_255720" name="Item_145" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T08:41:46+00:00" title="February  9, 2010  8:41AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha, the Germans sure seem to be in a tight place there, and so are the English.

Germany won't hold long without French support, and England apparently gave up. Italy will probably follow soon, as neither Russia nor France seems to have much motivation for preserving him.<br/><br/>This leaves only three significant Powers on the board. I'd expect that the players have already looked into the future without minor Powers and hashed out a three-way draw. The only realistic alternative is a solo victory for somebody, so I could imagine that we'd see some effort towards that - any of the three Powers would benefit from preserving the minor Powers if they wanted to try for a solo, though, so seeing them amass their strength towards consolidation makes me think that nobody's really serious about a solo victory. However, a genuine push for a three-way draw is something I wouldn't understand in this situation, as it's going to be the default solution anyway when those minor Powers become constantly more insignificant. Those three dominant Powers are already in a situation where their own destruction from the board would be all but unthinkable - they've already won a place in a three-player draw for themselves (barring a solo victory by somebody else), so there's nothing to lose by trying for a solo. Might be that they're just not thinking very effectively in these terms - it's pretty easy to get lost in the tactical issues in something like dominating the Mediterranean area.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256105/#Comment_256105" name="Item_150" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-11T05:52:17+00:00" title="February 11, 2010  5:52AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shit, Mike, <i>now</i>?!

France would capture London in the next year and Russia would be forced to take Edinburgh rather than leave it in my less-than-capable hands. I most certainly haven't 'given up,' I'm not some child turning over the game-board in frustration; my choice was the final tactical decision and I made it with pride and with admiration for my fellow players.  <br/><br/>Outside of the game, I've pressing commitments and so less and less time to consider my moves at length; a rash of hurried mis-orders and curt responses to diplomacy first cost me my status as major power, then my ability to function in a pro-active manner. It may have been that with enough diplomacy and tactical nous there was a possibility that I could have clawed back from the edge (both France and Germany have done so this game, as may Italy yet), but felt that my continued participation would have been merely a token gesture and the northern theatre would become significantly more lively without my stagnating decline. I hope I've ruffled no feathers surrendering thus, it was just the most positive action in the face of inability.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256231/#Comment_256231" name="Item_153" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-11T18:11:34+00:00" title="February 11, 2010  6:11PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm finding that 12 hours for the retreat and build phases is just not enough.

I think I gave Russia 1:1 in odds for a solo if he could keep the peace with Turkey until 1910. In hindsight that's not so far off; what he has is momentum against superior Grand Alliance strength, and momentum can be taken away by superior tactics. I'm just glad that Turkey finally turned, although I'm left to wonder if he'd been happy to ride the game to a "second place" if Russia didn't build in Sevastopol.<br/><br/>Russia has 15 SCs and immediate chances at London and Holland. The fleets on the Atlantic are equal in strength, so proceeding to MAO is out of the question. The Russian strength on land is impressive and he has no obvious weaknesses in his line, which makes me think that the very best the Grand Alliance can hope for is to stop him at 17 (after which they can, with time, bring their superior strength to bear in grinding him down), and even that requires above-norm tactics. Aside from London and Holland, Trieste and eastern Turkish home SCs are all potential targets in the immediate future, although Russia also has vulnerabilities. The ultimate reason (the one I'll be happy to harp on for a long time after the game if you'd like to hear my amazing 20/20 hindsight) for this imbalance in forces is that well over half dozen Grand Alliance units are stuck near permanently in the Mediterranean area, useless against the Russian, who in comparison has carefully arrayed his available strength on useful fronts. If this is going to Russia, it'll be because of strategic deployment overcoming the disparity in strength.<br/><br/>The landscape seems clear now: either Russia manages to strike a decisive blow towards victory, or the alliance manages to beat him back, at which point they can eliminate Italy at leisure and call a three-way draw. It'd sure be interesting to play Italy here - would need massive amounts of luck and discretion to rise from there. Probably not even possible if Turkey decides to take Tunis with his spare fleets.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257927/#Comment_257927" name="Item_164" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-23T14:36:25+00:00" title="February 23, 2010  2:36PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm invincible!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258519/#Comment_258519" name="Item_165" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-25T12:40:44+00:00" title="February 25, 2010 12:40PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh, Russia just won, didn't it?

Clearly I'm already demoralized and beaten, unable to formulate a coherent battle plan, and reduced to spasmodic twitching. I was in the Army in Germany at the end of the Cold War, and the joke was that should we go to war with Russia we'd have what was euphemistically called "a target-rich environment."

Now we might say that the danger in that part of the world has passed, and it's actually the Turk's turn to go on offensive there, perhaps with Con-Bul(ec), or similar.<br/><br/>The Turkish part of the front in general seems to be relatively solid, even an attack on Trieste doesn't seem too likely now that Russia detached the backup army from Galicia. Overall the French part of the front west of Switzerland seems the most vulnerable, and apparently that's where the Russian tries to makes his impact - he only needs to take both Netherlands to win, after all. Isn't happening this year, but there seems to be relatively little that the French can do to prevent Russia from retaking Holland and setting up a massive attack on Belgium for next year.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259076/#Comment_259076" name="Item_185" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-28T06:40:23+00:00" title="February 28, 2010  6:40AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2010 2:01PM by Brian_Minter.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Messed-up my post]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259081/#Comment_259081" name="Item_186" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-28T07:20:22+00:00" title="February 28, 2010  7:20AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, you still have a year.

That move could have been the upset that the Alliance needed, although the fact that Turkey still hasn't brought fleet power to bear on the Atlantic will surely mean that Russia will continue progressing through French lines for the year to come. Still, who knows - that raider on the Norwegian might slow things down further, and in theory it is true that the Alliance has the manpower to stop Russia; they just would need to get that power into position.<br/><br/>The Italian is playing on a razor's edge, I do not blame him for being active at this juncture. His only road to victory (participation in a draw) involves getting himself to a solid enough position to make his removal infeasible once the Alliance has stopped Russia. He can't wait until the latter is a done deal, but he can't attack Turkey so vigorously as to cause Russian victory, either.

You can often get away with an aggressive move toward a less-experienced player (or a trusting ally) purely based on the size of various territories. For example, an Italian or Turkish player who puts a fleet in the Western Med is only one space away from gettin' all up in England's grill, but it doesn't LOOK that way on the board.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/philaros" title="philaros"><img alt="philaros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/320/nZLZ1C0PEQG5H.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/philaros">philaros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260300/#Comment_260300" name="Item_211" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-05T15:17:11+00:00" title="March  5, 2010  3:17PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brian Minter</cite>It has no elegance, no charm</blockquote>\nAu contraire!

I think it highlights the cultural disparity that was brought up in the original thread.  There's no question that if Italy had assisted in turning back the Russian threat you guys would be, rightly, be grateful for his help.  On the other hand, Italy is down to a single non-home supply center.  It wouldn't be practical for him to swing by the penninsula and pick up one of his home centers before he heads to the Atlantic, and so, once it is clear that the Russian threat has been eliminated, there would be nothing to stop you from kicking him out of the final draw.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many reasons Italy might still be included.  I think two of the most prominent would be simple gratitude, and reputation effects (let Italy into the draw in this game so that you can elicit similar cooperation in future games).  Reputation effects are significant - it is easy to imagine that without Italy's cooperation a Russian victory would be certain, and so the ability to convincingly argue that you will include a 1-center power in a draw is significant.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am curious if there's anyone who would argue that Italy should be excluded from the draw, on the grounds that the other three players can reduce the size of the draw at no risk to themselves, and that is the goal they are supposed to be playing for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260551/#Comment_260551" name="Item_221" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-07T08:11:33+00:00" title="March  7, 2010  8:11AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not just gratitude.

England and Germany and I (as France) were trapped in a spiral of mutual suspicion and antagonism that harmed the ability of any two of us to work together--although this ultimately worked to my benefit, since it led to England and Germany falling out before they could put paid to France. But it made the early game unpleasant for me. Similarly, I'd begun to build what I thought was a good working relationship with Italy, but Turkey's insinuations about Italy's intentions made me puff up unnecessarily, and that did a lot of damage: Italy was facing the wrong way when Turkey came charging west as the southern horn of the Juggernaut. By then the threat from Russia was clear, and England and I aligned to resist his advance while at the same time trying to do in Germany. From my perspective, the situation looked to be shaping up to a long hard slog of East vs. West. I decided to stab England, hoping that Turkey would follow suit with Russia, and thus reshape the board with us as the dominant players. But this proved to be a pipe dream, and so Russia came and threw me out of England. Game over; I was on the defensive for most of the second half of the game, and ended up in control of the same 5 SCs I'd had in Fall 1901, and hard-pressed to hold on to those.<br/><br/>I tried to give support to Italy, thinking that if Turkey thought Italy were too tough a nut to crack, he might turn his sights northward, especially given Russia's gains in resources. But that didn't happen. I was also foolish to think that England would find discretion the better part of valor and willingly become French auxiliaries to prevent Russian ascendancy--forgetting that normal human beings, unlike <i>Diplomacy players</i>, are psychologically predisposed to punish betrayal. Also, I was in general tactically ineffectual; I didn't appreciate the difficulty France has in projecting her power (versus protecting her own territory, which is well-configured for defense). So I learned a lesson similar to the one Brian learned: when you hit, hit hard. But I'm proud of helping defend Italy; Chris was a canny and nervy tactician who I think impressed all of us with his hard-fighting defensive maneuvering against a numerically superior foe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260652/#Comment_260652" name="Item_228" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T07:32:50+00:00" title="March  8, 2010  7:32AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>Similarly, I'd begun to build what I thought was a good working relationship with Italy, but Turkey's insinuations about Italy's intentions made me puff up unnecessarily, and that did a lot of damage...</blockquote>\nI can't remember that very well.

Thank you all very much, it was a pleasure playing against you all.  I want to do a bunch of deconstruction of this game, but that will have to wait.  Briefly though, I want to throw out an answer to Bill's question.<br/><br/>The win I think, comes from being in position to take advantage of most of the strategic breaks in the game.  The specific points that jump out at me are:\n<ul>\n<li>Turkey's decisions to not stab me yet.  This went on throughout the game.  I considered stabbing him every single turn, but always decided he was more valuable to me as an ally than for whatever I could gain at whatever point.  Mostly that was due to the "army corridor" through Austria and the Balkans that kept Turkish troops sitting along my border the whole damn game.  I don't know Brian's reasons for not making the stab, but that is my number one reason for victory.</li><li>Austria fell quick and gave a good boost to my military strength.</li><li>German-English relations never gelled into either a nasty war or a solid alliance, which led to gains against Germany as well as a stranglehold on Scandinavia.</li><li>Chris's power failure.  I have no idea what this game would've looked like otherwise.</li><li>The French landing in Liverpool.  Possibly the single move (pre-endgame) that had the biggest impact from my point of view.  Basically allowed me to crush a previously strong England and put a unit in position in Denmark for use against Germany later on.</li>\n</ul>Those are the big ones that come to mindy.  I'd like to take a look back through the order history and pick out a few more.  It's impossible to say how much of this was luck and how much skill.  I tried to nurse English-German rivalry as much as possible; I whispered in Bill's ear constantly (trying to use my distance from him on the board to seem (and be) a trustworthy confidant); I made myself as desirable an alliancemate as possible for Turkey and <i>never</i> ever ever referred to him as a junior partner.<br/><br/>Juggernaut corollary - a huge part of my success coming out of that alliance was that, with the way the defenses went, I was of relatively little use to Turkey after Austria fell.  It basically split into two wars waged concurrently; he against Italy and me against Germany and England.  Not having to spend unit-orders supporting an ally <i>while still maintaining that alliance</i> allowed my significantly more force than I'd have had otherwise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260779/#Comment_260779" name="Item_232" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T15:35:28+00:00" title="March  8, 2010  3:35PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marhault</cite>I don't know Brian's reasons for not making the stab, but that is my number one reason for victory.</blockquote>\nFailure of imagination.

From the British perspective, the major events in the western theatre are as such: <br/><br/><i>I. Failure of the British-Italian-German venture against France in the first years of play. Unable to bring to bear my own forces in the French heartland the invasion faltered as German and Italian conviction wavered through, I believe, a combination of French diplomacy and eastern threats. <br/>II. Failure of the British-(Italian-)French attack on Germany subsequent to France's revival. Germany, like France previously, came close to collapse but was able to resist as British forces on the continental mainland failed to materialise once more; France became over-stretched Britain refused to extend her either trust or support.<br/>III. Anglo-Russian agreements regarding Scandinavia begin to look insubstantial as Britain's only option for expansion is into that theatre and Russia refuses to turn her attentions onto Turkey. <br/>IV. Britain rises to the height of its power, claiming the Lowlands and threatening Germany's northern S.Cs. I attempt to normalise relations between Britain and France in the hope of a western alliance against Russia and what appears to be a German puppet-state. <br/>V. Russia breaches Scandinavian agreements and Britain mobilizes for a northern campaign without having captured the long-threatened German territories. <br/>VII. French betrayal causes the British power-base to collapse. Continental forces are destroyed as Russia capitalizes on my panic. Lacking the ability to repel both French and Russian forces and frustrated by prevalent misordering, I surrender.</i><br/><br/>My play was characterized by a heavy reliance on perceived allies, but attempts to orchestrate combined assaults to dispatch my neighbors proved ineffective on both occasions; had I managed become a presence on the continent and topple either Germany or France the end-game would be entirely different. <br/><br/>I can only condemn the French betrayal. Not because it was a betrayal <i>per se</i>, but because it wasn't the most sensible move to make. With more foresight a counter-juggernaut could have been swiftly put together and its growth stalled long enough to disrupt the alliance between Russia and Turkey. <br/><br/>Hmm, more thoughts later!

I thought Brian would remember that "historically" (i.e., in accounts of <i>Diplomacy</i> play) Turkey winds up with the short end of the juggernaut more often than not. But now I realize that I misjudged; my efforts to help Italy resist Turkish encroachment only made the latter's determination to conquer it more dogged. But piling on Italy to end the war sooner was out, because Turkey had warned me off the entire Italian peninsula, so "helping" him would have been antagonistic, ironically. Regardless: my plan was bad, my execution toothless, and my communications ineffectual. As we French say: <i>c'est la guerre</i>.<br/><br/>Having played two games now while paying attention to the experience, I am inclined to regard <i>Diplomacy</i> as an instructive perversity: compelling in its way, but capable of injecting its poisonous Machiavellianism into one's daily interactions if one were not careful to bracket off the lessons of the game from those of everyday experience.<br/><br/>Still, I would play again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260808/#Comment_260808" name="Item_235" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T18:38:18+00:00" title="March  8, 2010  6:38PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess Chris' play as Italy was the ruin of both France and Turkey.

Austria suffers inordinately of timidity, because that triggers a feeding frenzy in the neighbours: each neighbour quite rationally comes to a point where he no longer sees Austria as a believably viable Power in its own right, at which point their interest turns to securing their own borders. The Austria opening that failed to secure Galicia while signalling clear distrust of Italy painted him as victim, lubricating the way for the others to work against him. The Austrian player can console himself with the fact that Italy suffered a very typical fate after Austrian elimination: Italy has to be inordinately careful of a Russo-Turkish alliance after an Austrian split, as he's really a junior partner in that sort of thing geopolitically, and may at best hope to hold his own against the easterners until France gets around to stabbing him in the back.<br/><br/>German play was pretty good, it seemed to me. She ultimately got caught up in the double-front dynamics that make central positions so difficult, but even when it seems to me that plenty of diplomatic effort was expended to keep her in the game. Early action against f.ex. France was solid and decisive, only brought low due to her underestimating the Juggernaut alliance - a mistake made by everybody. Not a bad show at all.<br/><br/>French play was pretty indecisive up to late midgame, I didn't quite get a sense of where he was going or what he was trying to do. France is an easy Power to play passively, as the Iberian depth allows her to remain competitive long into mid-game without taking any sort of real initiative against anybody else. The endgame was logical, and I ultimately think that the French player was right to expect Turkey to interfere against Russia; of course responsibility for convincing Turkey was largely his - France and Turkey apparently didn't manage to find a common strategic vision that would have accurately predicted the Russian ascendancy, or they wouldn't have allowed the situation to devolve to the point of no return as they (Turkey, I guess - I'd be surprised if France adviced prudence at any point) did.<br/><br/>English play lacked strategic vision in my eyes - In -04 I was strongly of the opinion that England should not strive to fight a continental war against both France and Germany for the occupied Netherlands; better to convoy to the north and overcome the still fledgling Russian northern fleet. The English position became fragile as the Russian pressure was not countered by reducing continental commitment and striving to create working relationships with the other western Powers, it seemed to me. The French victories of -05 were largely a result of the English strength stretching too thin, with the non-surprising outcome that English integrity was fatally weakened by the loss of Liverpool. It would have been better to lose both Netherlands to Germany early, strenghtening her against Russia and gaining tempo in the north; Liverpool is more valuable than the Netherlands, as the latter can be recaptured without massive redistribution of forces.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most decisive and influential strategic scheme on the board in this game was the Juggernaut alliance. I was strongly predisposed to expect the Turkish player to look for a strong alliance after our last game, so I constantly felt like I had a clearer picture of the overall strategic development than the players themselves did - where they saw a temporary and later an unlikely alliance between two mid-strength Powers, I saw just one question: would Russia break the alliance or work with it? Ultimately Russia took that alliance just as far as it went, and was in fact the one to break it by building another fleet in Sevastopol. It is not unreasonable to forgive the western Powers for not foreseeing the Russian ascendancy, as Turkey had both midling opportunities and ample motive to stab the Russian once it became clear that Italy would offer stiff resistance while Germany and England would fall like chaff. However, that's diplomacy - maybe Brian talked a good talk about betraying Russia "any time now", and thus influenced the others to expect a more neutral play from him than he ultimately presented?<br/><br/>The Russian play was overall of high quality, I can't fault this victory despite some minor tactical plundering of the sort anybody commits now and then. The approach against England was clearly well-supported by diplomacy, while the use of Germany as a puppet that was weakened in stages before finishing her was good discretion. I will admit that I would probably not have been able to play the Russian position to this victory myself - I might have found another way, but I just wouldn't have had the brass balls to keep cool with Turkey while the strategic reality became more and more obviously biased against our alliance. Annexing Germany and attacking France on both continent and the Atlantic was a risky play in that Turkey could've turned the momentum at that moment; I would've kept a nominal French alliance, propped a German puppet to keep France occupied and allied with the Italian remnants against Turkey in the hopes of causing enough chaos with the German and Italian minor Powers that the Alliance would find it impossible to straighten their lines against me later. The reality proved the Tsar right in this matter, however: the single-minded Turkish assault in Italy ultimately ended up in a situation where, when Russia finally struck, the Alliance had <i>8 units</i> committed to the Mediterranean theatre, nearly half their strength immediately useless against Russia. Towards the end of the game this number was reduced to a couple of units, but the local tactical superiority enjoyed by Russia on the Atlantic and the parity on the continent was largely because the other players had been very careless about amassing their collective strength in positions where it would be awkward and inefficient to turn it against Russia. Classical logic for achieving a solo victory.<br/><br/>Hindsight is 20/20, so it can't be directly compared to decisions made during the game. However, we can make theoretical conclusions, and one I'd like to propose is that Turkey was the most responsible for this game ending in a Russian solo victory. Many of the decisions made by the other players can be largely excused by them expecting the Russo-Turkish alliance to break down once it became a clearly one-sided affair. You can't always wait for the perfect stab, sometimes wars have to be opened even against faithful allies in situations where the war will gain you, personally, nothing. The alternative is to look on while your erstwhile ally wins the game and consigns you to a shameful loss as the partner who made it possible. The other losers played mostly rationally (if not always smartly) insofar as I read the map, while the Turk exemplified the sort of faithfulness in alliance that is often characterized as timid, uncaring, naive or colluding.<br/><br/>Of course, it is also easy to distribute the blame around by remembering that the other players very well could have prepared for this conceivable development much better. Especially the French stab against England was a controversial move in this regard; I would've totally done it myself if I felt that a Turkish stab against Russia would've been the result, but well - maybe Turkey didn't transmit his intentions honestly enough, and France therefore misjudged the situation? Had France known that Turkey wouldn't be swayed against Russia even by the total annihilation of any northern defence, the choice to cooperate with England against Russia would have been a no-brainer, instead. An interesting example of communication strategy, this: Turkey could've talked the west into resisting Russia (thus gaining time for taking Italy himself and having a shot at victory) by being absolutely clear about his intent to stand by Russia no matter what. Stabbing England only made sense in a world where the Juggernaut could have been broken.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260850/#Comment_260850" name="Item_240" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T03:02:15+00:00" title="March  9, 2010  3:02AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also: I'm available for a third round of Diplomacy.

"Turkey didn't stab Russia early enough" is actually just a facet of the 'real' reason for the outcome.  The real thing is "The Grand Alliance wasn't put together early enough" or "the Grand Alliance wasn't effective enough".  I mean, Bill talked about how he should've been playing Paul Revere against us, I think that's totally true.<br/><br/>If Italy, England, France and Germany had been able to put aside their differences and form a juggernaut breaker after we had divided Austria and the Balkans between us, that would've stopped it.  And let's face it, a juggernaut at that stage has enough momentum to warrant serious cooperative opposition.  Difficult to do?  Yes, sure, but the Grand Alliance in 1913 had four Powers in it too, y'know?<br/><br/>Brian, it's going to be strange to watch this game without you in command of those yellow armadas.<br/><br/>Willow, Eero, you seem to have more classical diplomacy knowledge than I do.  I understand about possessing the corners of the board, but is the juggernaut really <i>that</i> much more dangerous than any other two nation alliance?  It seems to me the main strength in this thing is a DMZ on one border that allows you to be more effective elsewhere.  I mean, France and England could do the same thing, couldn't they?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261003/#Comment_261003" name="Item_246" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T12:49:20+00:00" title="March  9, 2010 12:49PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The three things that favour the Juggernaut are:<ul><li>The easily demilitarized border.</li><li>Austria.</li><li>Clearly delineated lines of further progress far into the mid- and even end-game.</li></ul>\nIn comparison France and England do not have these things. Their border is always a bit dangerous, as losing MAO would be fatal to France, and Liverpool is very difficult to defend or retake. They do not have a quickly dying neighbour that might be attacked by somebody else from behind them (most of the time Russia won't attack Germany in the early game). As the game proceeds, the prospects for advancement between the two are not very clearly delineated when compared to the neat fleet/army split between Turkey and Russia.<br/><br/>Of course a western alliance can be effective as well, but they'll have more pressure to attack each other than Russia and Turkey, which makes such an alliance less stable and thus less powerful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11269/diplomacy-sg-game-2/p4" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11269/diplomacy-sg-game-2">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11269/diplomacy-sg-game-2/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11269/diplomacy-sg-game-2/p3">3</a><a class=" p-4" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11269/diplomacy-sg-game-2/p4" rel="prev">4</a><a class="Highlight p-5 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11269/diplomacy-sg-game-2/p5">5</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F11269%2Fx%2Fp5%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F11269%2Fx%2Fp5%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
