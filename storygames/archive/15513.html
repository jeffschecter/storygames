But this view, while correct, is one sided. After all, such conditions exist in a hundred countries, but revolutions erupt rarely. What is needed is the consciousness of poverty, and the consciousness of oppression, and the conviction that poverty and oppression are not the natural order of the world. It is curious that in this case, experience in and of itself, no matter how painful, does not suffice, The indispensable catalyst is the word, the explanatory idea. More than petards or stilettos, therefore, words \u2013 uncontrolled words, circulating freely, underground, rebelliously, not gotten up in dress uniforms, uncertified \u2013 frighten tyrants.\u201d</blockquote>\n  Ryszard Kapuscinski, Shah of Shahs<br/><br/>Subversive words is one of the dictator games in my heads of state series. In the game, players control characters in a work of art that a dissident writer/ artist is making on the touchy subject of the tyrant \u2013 and the artist herself as a character struggling with life, creativity and censorship. <br/><br/>Subversive Words plays as a fairly fast-paced, largely collaborative storytelling game that bounces between the artist and the work of art. When describing the life of the artist, players move a token around an emotional wheel. They narrate events that would cause the artist to feel the emotion on which the token is located. When narrating the events of the book/ opera/ painting/ film/ video game etc that the artist is working on, players draw scrabble pieces and narrate events focused on a key word that starts with one of their letters. To help tie the two sides of the game together and pace the stories, the letters used in the art side of the game are the currency to move on the emotional wheel in the artist side of the game. <br/><br/>Since I wanted to double check how the letters/ tokens worked between the two sides of the game, Tony, Judson, Josh and I played  Subversive Words. First we needed to decide who the tyrant was, who the artist was, what previous work the artist was best known for, and develop a small cast of characters from the artwork. Earlier playtests had included games focusing on a drama about a Carpathian monarch and a street mural about Indonesian dictator General Suharto. We were stuck for an idea on what tyrant to focus on until Josh, who has been researching 19th century geo politics for a game he is working on, suggested making William McDougall, a Canadian regional governor, the \u2018tyrant\u2019 so the artist could be a M\xe9tis (half native, half European) partisan of the red river rebellion that resisted the incorporation of their region into the Canadian federation. We decided that the artist was novelist known for a  Swiftian novel satirizing Canadian politics. The main characters of his new novel-in-progress would be Billy the trapper (presumably a stand in for the tyrant McDougall; Marie, his unrequited love; his friend Hank the country lawyer; and a wolf, the personification of nature) <br/><br/>After drawing scrabble pieces, we started the game inside the book, moved to the novelist and back between so that we had 3 \u2018chapters\u2019 on each side. A sample sequence of play in the novel- determining what is being written in the book:<br/>R for Represent \u2013 Billy will represent himself (in a lawsuit to try to seize property that  Marie lives on)<br/>V for Voir dire- billy is asking questions of his peers, thinks they are all biased <br/>T for Tears \u2013 billy cries while questioning marie <br/>N for Nolo contendere \u2013 hank pleads no contest for marie<br/>G for Gold- so billy gets access to the gold on the property<br/>L for Land \u2013 and becomes a major landowner <br/>N for Network \u2013and  creates a network of trapper spies<br/>M for Marie- billy confronts marie<br/>N for No \u2013 billy proposes to marie, she says no<br/>B for Bigamy- she says no because she has already married Hank (at the court after the trial) <br/><br/>A sample of the movement/ narration on the artist side of the game:<br/><br/>Optimism \u2013 writer\u2019s lawyer explains that the circumstances of his arrest may allow him to be released from gaol.<br/>Joy- his spirits soar as he hears the prison band play <br/>Anticipation- expects a visit from his wife and lawyer<br/>Surprise- is woken and taken to scaffold early in morning<br/>Awe- noose on neck, contemplates his mortality<br/>Acceptance- he accepts his fate <br/><br/>The game worked fine to generate two stories but the movement rules in the artist side of the game (placing down tokens on spaces you start on  and move through; putting down tokens where you move through and end) was a lot of effort without doing much. We worked out a variant in which play would start in the art side of the game and every time a player uses a letter, they put it down on their choice of emotion on the emotional wheel. Then when play switches to the artists\u2019 side, players had to start on the wedge with the most letters on it and movement could only be between spaces with letters. In this way, players would seed the emotional wheel during the art story. <br/><br/>We also discussed whether letter points could be counted to determine which player could name the work of art at the end of the game (to add a little competition). perhaps as an option?<br/><br/>I think our next heads of state playtest will be the assassination game Sic Semper Tyrannus to see how its rules on garbling messages have held up. <br/><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2088966277/heads-of-state-nine-short-games-about-tyrants" rel="nofollow">the heads of state kickstarter</a> is getting close to funding, check it out if interested.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
