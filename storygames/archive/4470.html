I love my story games. However, I did want to include something in Misspent Youth which would help to construct a coherent story with a game. This also hopefully will solve the hideous problem I ran into the last couple of times I ran a playtest where I kept on saying, "So what are you doing now, guys?"<br/><br/>Anyway, here's a first crack at a solution. It's a strong scene structure for the game. A few things you need to know for this to make sense: Misspent Youth is a near-future science fiction game about youthful rebellion, friendship, and growing up. It uses a mechanic that used to be a lot more like craps than it is now. It's a stakes-setting game but where each roll back-and-forth produces description stuff a la Dogs in the Vineyard. The Tag is a totem that's passed from player to player, once per scene (maybe), when you make someone else look cool. It makes you the in-fiction leader of the crew of ruffians you're a part of and gives you powers and responsibilities. The Authority is the name for the GM role. It's also the villain you collaboratively create. The "claim" are the two numbers (along with 7) that The Authority will win on if they are rolled. If The Authority does win, it may choose to give on the conflict in order to permanently change the Youthful Offenders (PCs) by twisting one of their traits to a darker, grown-up version.<br/><br/>I'd welcome feedback on this. I suspect a lot of the "will it work?" questions will be answered empirically during alpha play testing, but I'd love to hear what you think.<br/><br/><a href="http://indie-insurgent.livejournal.com/4436.html#cutid1" rel="nofollow">Link to LJ 'cause I can't make the formatting here behave.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101164/#Comment_101164" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-04T18:26:04+00:00" title="October  4, 2007  6:26PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm attempting something similar with the Pentasystem, and it looks like (unsurprisingly) we have come up with some of the same stuff. What I don't have a solution for, and it looks like you don't completely either, is some way of guiding the rising action/climax/falling action apart from just "this is the kind of stuff we're steering towards at this point in the game". I'd really like that to be organic.<br/><br/>The idea of the Tag is a good one, kind of a secondary GM-role but it can be passed around the group?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101169/#Comment_101169" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-04T19:18:26+00:00" title="October  4, 2007  7:18PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MikeRM</cite>The idea of the Tag is a good one, kind of a secondary GM-role but it can be passed around the group?</blockquote>\nYeah, whenever I make your character look good, rely on you, etc., I claim the Tag.<br/><br/>And thanks! I'm not sure if it's going to be that organic. Or, rather, that what we have now is organic-only.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
