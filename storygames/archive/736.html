                    I would like to start off with 2 little personal things. First this is the third time I have taken this book out of the Library; The first time I was looking for info on how actors create characters. the book didn't seem to tell me much about that I took it back without seriously reading it. The second time, I read the Narrative chapter and most of the spontenaity chapter and took it back. This time, and this also brings us to the second thing I was going to mention I was reading the book while playing and more importantly working with the rules to MLWM. I have now read the book cover to cover and get more every time I reread to do this thing. <br/><br/>If I looked at chapter 4 durring the previous times I had the book I would have completely scoffed at this chapter. I suppose I looked at it both times. It is full of wooly headed stuff about trances and masks making people behave in a certain way. I'm not much of a believer in anything, I accept science but find myself challenging many of those ideas before using them, and this was the kind of thing I would reject out of hand. Then last week when we played MLWM the master was supposed to be a Goth kid in high school I opened my mouth to say his firsdt command and "found the voice". It wasn't particularly Goth, more preppy, but it worked and I found it very easy to slip into and out of. It may be that the book has had an influence on me, but I feel now that I can accept and understand the chapter in ways that I couldn't last week.  Sorry to ramble <br/><br/>The first thing I would like to piont out in this chapter is that this is the first chapter where Johnstone hasn't mentioned laughing and none of the examples were light. Does he seem to you to be talking about something different than he was talking about before?<br/><br/>Second Does this sound like immersion or is it something else?<br/><br/>I am intrigued by the idea of costume for character in a game. I know that some people suggest this for MLWM when you are the master you pick up a prop. In some ways I think that the same could be done with a totem. I know when you play monopoly you don't become the scotty dog but maybe there could be a game where you were you character when you picked up the icon. Especially in games with coownership of characters. You put on the sheriff hat and you are the sheriff. <br/><br/>that's what I have for now what do y'all want to talk about?                </div>

                            Hoo boy.  Yes, I think this chapter is a bit of a departure and doesn't seem to build on the previous ones in a substantive way.  That's cool, though.  <br/><br/>I don't think the mask state is straight immersion, particularly the quasi-mystical element Johsntone repeatedly refers to.  I really think honest mask work is something deeper that playing a character.  How that relates to role-playing I haven't worked out.  <br/><br/>Is a character sheet a mask?  Is it the object that gives you permission to enter another state?  Or, weirdly, is the relationship reversed, with a character taking the role of a loa and riding the player?                        </div>

<i>If I looked at chapter 4 durring the previous times I had the book I would have completely scoffed at this chapter. ... Then last week when we played MLWM the master was supposed to be a Goth kid in high school I opened my mouth to say his firsdt command and "found the voice". </i><br/><br/>What a great example.  I know several people who find a particular voice for a character.   Though I think it is often used to help others tell characters apart, the internal bit of helping you better feel the role is likely as important.   <br/><br/>I'm interested in exploring that switch from comedy to drama/tragedy.  (Johnstone talks about the tragic mask being full-face and comedic allowing the mouth to be shown).  Also in hearing about peoples' experiences with this sort of thing--"possession" by a character in their play.  I've mostly encountered this in ritual space (including full-blown possession and ecstatic trance).  <br/><br/>This also brings up questions of boundaries and I will not abandon you play et al.<br/><br/>If anyone is interested in reading more about trance experiences, Maya Deren's book, <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0914232630/103-9446927-9962233?v=glance&amp;n=283155" rel="nofollow">Divine Horsemen</a></i> which was mentioned in Impro is a great source. Also, there is a film <i><a href="http://www.dancesofecstasy.com/" rel="nofollow">Dances of Ecstasy</a></i> that is very worth watching.  I'll post links in a minute.                        </div>

                            I learned a lot from Zora Neale Hurston's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060916494/002-2670962-8532024" rel="nofollow">Tell My Horse</a>.  I've never experienced ecstatic trance or possession but I've had theatrical performances where the character seemed to take over (so maybe I have after all).    <br/><br/>I often use voices for characters in tabletop gaming but it is a conscious thing, more of an embellishment.  Although now that I think about it, I never prepare for them - they just emerge, but always under my control.  So where' s the line between creativity and something spookier?                        </div>

                            Maybe it's a matter of surrender on the part of the player.  If you really wanted to let your voices take the lead, you might be surprised by them. <br/>
<br/>
It seems like this chapter brings together issues of spontaneity and immersion.  It doesn't really build on the discussion of the other three chapters, but I can imagine mask work being part of the culmination of the improv work he describes.  Letting go of your critical voices, learning to work with what is suggested rather than negating it, and so on.  <br/>
<br/>
In the other chapters he emphasizes how much you have to let go of your conditioning to do the right thing and not be offensive. Once you let go of a lot of this conditioning, what you come to is much more likely to be what's really important and even troubling to you.  Humor is a release of tension, and trance work is about going in to the source of the tension and following it to it's source.  Or being carried away by a something larger that the ego steps out of the way for.  Crazy stuff. : ) And powerful.                        </div>

                            Thor, yes, I think that this is related to immersion: there's some idea of being possessed by the character.<br/>
<br/>
The idea of trance states is, I think, related to rituals in RPGs. I haven't played Polaris, but I'm sure that the candle and the repetition of phrases produces some sort of altered state.<br/>
<br/>
Emily, that's a really good call with the "I will not abandon you" play. <br/>

Don't have much to say about this chapter, but I just love it.<br/>

                            Cripes, I've being playing catch-up with this reading group all month - finishing chapters just as the thread for the next one starts up. But this time I've reached synchronicity! And good thing, as I do have a few thoughts about it. <br/><br/>First off, I would personally not consider a character sheet a Mask. Yes, it offers cover and safety to the actor to be unlike themselves, from a rational level, just as you do with a part and a script in conventional theatre. But it doesn't get close to the physical-affective-cognitive interaction that the use of Masks is described as having. Obscuring the face is cutting off a basic feedback loop - primitive contagion - that regulates interaction in a social space. This is a big deal. I find it fascinating, but reasonable, that this simple step is such an enabler of transformation to such a subsequent degree - the regression, the loss of language, etc.<br/><br/>So do people roleplay using actual Masks, or analogues that do mask or interfere with natural physiological processes that ground us in normal sets of behaviour?<br/><br/>[edited to finish off a thought]                        </div>

                            Polaris with masks, or half-masks would be a very different game.  Personally I think it would be scary good once you got over the "this is silly" hump.  All the ritual elements in Polaris seem to help set the mood, but don't push play into a truly ritual space, in my experience.                        </div>

                            I'm imagining doing something simple like playing Carry or Red Sky A.M. with players of officers wearing reflective sunglasses to reduce how much the enlisted men could read off of them. Changing the information flow.  <br/><br/><i>Obscuring the face is cutting off a basic feedback loop - primitive contagion - that regulates interaction in a social space. This is a big deal. I find it fascinating, but reasonable, that this simple step is such an enabler of transformation to such a subsequent degree - the regression, the loss of language, etc.</i><br/><br/>This is serious stuff.  Regression or falling deeply "in" to a character are profoundly un-social activities (or can be). In ritual space the people taken either become officiants, or are tended by others--they take up a lot of space, but give back by channeling the energy etc. The improv games we read about before are so different from this. <br/><br/>In rpg, taking up that much space can be really problematic unless you're set up for it.  There's also the issue of "my-guyism". Are we getting together to channel characters or create a story? Can we do both?                        </div>

Where's the dichotomy? Character is revealed through dramatic action. Stories are made of dramatic action. In KJ terms, dramatic action happens precisely in response to a broken routine, so you have to establish routines before you can break them. Now, you use the time spent establishing routines to also get into the channelling state, so that when the conflict happens you're able to let the response well up organically.                        </div>

                            Neel, that's true, but I suspect that the 'stories' you produce through standard Maskplay are primal, blunt and undifferentiated, and its very difficult to produce something of the sophistication we expect from fiction, or even obtain using standard gaming techniques. <br/><br/>I can certainly see the appeal in "man angry, child scared -&gt; child hides -&gt;child finds item -&gt; child angry, man scared"; as is, it clutches at some very fundamental drives. And elaborated upon, using language and context, it could form the template for a powerful and profound story. But by its nature I don't see how Maskplay could provide this elaboration - without the use of techniques designed to promote this. So this is less me disagreeing and more me saying "yes, there is raw story ore in abundance - can we build systems to refine it?"<br/><br/>People have mentioned how different this chapter is from the ones that precede it, most striking in KJ's change in tone, but also the content and techniques. I think that trance is probably not as far from many of these other techniques, e.g. status play, as it might appear: trance isn't a 'special state' but the end of a continuum of suggested behaviour. Hence it should be possible to dial-Masks-down - inhabit other entitites that do not represent the break that documented experiences do - the "Mask of you but old and weary", say. This would be a less astounding process, from a subjective POV,  but might allow the Maskplayer to bring more resources to bear to affect the game-space in way that are interesting.                        </div>

                            Mmm. I get the feeling that we're seeing masks as rather self-indulgent: a raw force that needs to be channelled or coped with. That's not my experience with them.<br/>
<br/>
I've done maskwork before: as in, I've worn a half-mask and done scenes with other masks. And I've watched scenes played by other masks.<br/>
<br/>
Story-wise, those scenes are very satisfying. Masks can fall in love or fight or make and break friendships. Sure, it's primal, but they're good stories, without any refining.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not quite sure about Emily's points. There's definitely an element to which <br/>
Masks need to be observed by an outsider (to make sure they don't hurt themselves or each other). <br/>
<br/>
But, beyond that, there's really nothing very un-social about masks. They're very childlike and hence very reactive to people around them. The "my guy" issue doesn't really come up. They're not difficult to play scenes with: they're fantastic, in fact, because they react to everything you do. <br/>

                            The GM could function as the story guide durring mask play. <br/><br/>I also wonder if there is some level between formal play and raw mask stuff that we might be looking for? <br/><br/>Jason - From what I've heard, Polaris with half masks would be wonderful. The game is already set with lots of ritualistic parts. Also Ben's new game "The Manner of Befor" strikes me as tilting toward this sort of ritual space. <br/><br/>Emily - I like the idea of power figures in Mirror shades. That totally rocks!<br/><br/>Graham - Did you experience the "possesion" of the masks the way Johnstone portrays it, or was it something more manageable?                        </div>

A bit of both. You're in an altered state, behaving as the mask rather than yourself, but you're aware of what you're doing.<br/><br/>To give an example: as the mask, I liked a mirror that the instructor was holding and tried to grab it. Eventually, she gave it to me, but I couldn't hold it, and the mirror fell to the floor and shattered. She told me to take off the mask, but I was aware enough that I would have done that anyway.<br/><br/>So there's certainly an element of being "possessed" (or call it what you like) but it didn't mean I was unaware.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Graham -- your report matches my experience with altered states of consciousness. Self-hypnosis, flow states arising from doing math or target shooting, immersion -- all these are altered states of consciousness, and in all cases I'm not thinking normally, but I'm not unaware of what I'm doing. It's sometimes a mystical experience, but there's nothing occult happening. But if you want to describe a mystical experience, I figure you're either going to use mystical language or write papers with fancy statistics for cognitive science journals.

                            Re immersion/channeling/self-hypnosis: I've recently done a session of trance-induced shared dreaming (the second in a row; the first one's <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=18593.0" rel="nofollow">here</a>). We do this with eyes closed; so, even if we're not wearing masks, we're cut off from visual communication.<br/>
<br/>
In this one, the goal was to meet and/or become a mythical creature. I chose the minotaur.<br/>
<br/>
While in the (light) trance state, I was able to get very into the head of the creature, feeling the dark, mute, confused anger of the beast. However, in order to speak, I had to come out of it a bit. It wasn't possible to be both a social participant in the "game" and be completely immersed - the minotaur couldn't speak, after all. I was aware of all this, and made a rational, social choice to speak rather than to go deeper in.                        </div>
