Sorry if I upset you with my rejection of your train of thought.<br/><br/>But my experience with the long-haul D&amp;D groups (only a couple of groups), indicates that they don't bother with such drama. I believe it rare for such themes to surface in such a group. So I would prefer to take this discussion in other directions.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Davis</cite>To be more precise, there are incidents in which the ignorance OF some actor in the event is the source of the twist. There are also hidden motives - the actor in the event is well aware of why they do a thing, but that reason is lost to history.</blockquote>These are the kind of things I'm thinking of; the ignorance and the misguided actions/arguments that wins the day, and make us all walk in the wrong direction. We know these things occur, and quite often, but they are rarely investigated in literature, and never have been explored in role-playing games (to my knowledge; and the games mentioned here indicates that it is so).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Epidiah Ravachol</cite>The old Birthright setting for AD&amp;D certainly provided a starting point for this kind of play, though it was focused on a particular generation rather than spanning generations.  In particular, the political focus was there.  Done well - maybe not.</blockquote>I believe you are right; it provides <i>a starting point</i>. I've discussed Birthright before, but never had the pleasure of trying it out. I do have the impression it is a first shot at something that may be done much better, though. It may be that modern rpg-tools are better suited to simulate the theme I'm talking of here.<br/><br/>However; the theme in question is not easily explored by a designer. It demands a high level of consciousness, and some deep insight into political processes. Probably on a level most politicians fail to reach.<br/><br/>There are a bunch of insightful designers active on this forum, so I believe this is the best place to look for the brains that may crack this nut, and the best place to investigate the theme openly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
