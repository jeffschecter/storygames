I didn't search The Forge or any other gaming forum for advice on the game.  And I wanted to start off with this proviso: I don't think that a published, finished game should require outside text to be interpretable.  Joshua, I don't know how much haze there is to rectify, but all the same, a certain amount of what I've got to say here is regarding what I feel is a less than clear presentation.  So, an important premise to this critique is this: <strong>one of my criteria is that the rules text should stand on it's own.</strong>  While my comprehension might be aided, or my enjoyment improved by a direct dialog with the designer, if the text doesn't get me to an enjoyable game, most readers aren't going to take the extra step.<br/><br/>And, for context, this critique is based on the game of <cite>Shock:</cite> I played with Josh BishopRoby and Mark Valliantanos.  And other members of LA Gamers were sorely missed.<br/><br/>That said:<br/><br/>First of all, there's the ongoing whine about indie games needing a copy editor.  For <cite>Shock:</cite> I feel like it's inescapably apt.  It wasn't until I was reading passages aloud to try to resolve our confusions that I found gems like "When deciding who owns Shocks and Issues, remember: someone's going to have a say in how these work."  Which seems better out of context than in, honestly.  Then there's weird mid-paragraph non-sequiturs, like the top paragraph on page 24, where we go from the components of Antagonists ("After that, Features...") from Antagonists having intentions.  Reading over the text critically, my overall impression is that there's a decided amount of unpacking that needs to happen.  I get the impression of a complete game design that didn't entirely make it into text.<br/><br/>For the record our grid looked like this:  <br/>Issues: Corporatism, Judson; Family Identity, Mark; and Ecology, Joshua.  <br/>Shocks: L-5 Orbital Colony, Josh; Human Cloning, Judson; Robot Slaves, Mark.  <br/>Protagonists were: Gardener Peng, played by Judson, Ecology/L-5 Colony; Nanny Josephine, played by Josh, Family Identiy/Human Cloning; and Emanuel Sextus, played by Mark, Corporatism/Human Cloning.<br/><br/>The Grid is an awesome idea.  I think.  And I'm tentative because there's a lot about the Grid that isn't clear from reading the text.  I couldn't find any suggestions on how many Shocks and Issues we should come up with (except for implicit limits on which ones would be represented by Protagonists.)  <br/><br/>More troublesome is that, there's no explanation of what anything past an Issue or a Shock is supposed to mean.  What should we take away from the fact that Emanuel Sextus' name appears in the Corporatism/Human Cloning block?  He had a job with the corporation that managed real estate within the colony, but that was rapidly mooted, and never really addressed Corporatism as an issue.  The text doesn't really address that at all.  There's some suggestion to the Antagonist player to look at the Shocks and Issues of the Protagonist, but there's no indication about how they should relate to the Protagonist, which left each of us finding our own solutions.  <br/><br/>We sort of absorbed Robot Slaves into the Minutae, and I think that kind of worked, but it'd be nice to have a discussion of what happens to unrepresented Shocks and Issues.<br/><br/>As far as the artifact of the Grid sheet is concerned, we all agreed that it would have been nice to have the Praxis Scales appear on the Grid, so that we could all note them down together.   This is really a niggle though, but all the same, it'd be nice to see.  Even more trivially: a Minutae sheet would have been kind of awesome.  I mean, we had a blank for everything else, but on Minutae we're on our own.  Like I said: niggles.<br/><br/>Our Praxis looked like: "Rebel v. Obey - Adapt v. Innovate"  I think we liked them more at the beginning of the game than by the end, and that's a larger criticism.  We were pleased with how we'd related the world we'd created with the Grid to our Praxis Scales, but over the course of the game we were less enthralled.  We had a lot of "oh wait, I need to pick a scale" after we rolled dice, and we came to think that it was because we didn't feel much of a connection between conflicts and the Scales we chose to resolve them.  Maybe that had to do with the Scales we chose?  But all in all, there wasn't much in the way of advice to warn us off the ones we did choose.<br/><br/>For that matter, from what we could tell, Features didn't seem to actually matter much either.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but our collective and careful reading of the text was that: for Protagonists, the number of Features you have was the number of dice you roll, and the names of those features is sort of irrelevant to their mechanical purpose.  I know that I liked the Features I built up for Gardener Peng, but I really couldn't tell you what Features Emannuel Sextus or Nanny Josephine had.  And for Antagonists, the text appears to say (and forums I read seem to back this up) that Features are pure color, and dice rolled are completely based on how many credits the Antagonist Player is willing to spend.  Calling both things "Features" made that understanding harder to reach.<br/><br/>Now, here's the thing <cite>Shock:</cite> did really well: there's a strong, tight reward cycle on presenting bangs to other players.  I really enjoyed handing Mark interesting situations, and he certainly seemed to enjoy having his Protagonist's kidney harvested and legs amputated.  I don't know how much those activities we enjoyed by Mark and Josh in their respective roles, but they seemed to being enjoying themselves, and the d10/d4 mechanic certainly attached a Skinner-like reward to presenting suck around the table.  Once we started, it was hard to stop.<br/><br/>In the post-mortem, though, we all agreed that we felt sort of like we were kicking the guy on our right in the nuts and yelling "Bang!"  And while that was kind of fun, the evening as a whole wasn't very satisfying.  We wound up with three series of scenes that linked up like box cars, rather than anything that satisfied as fiction.  And that was sort of the inspiration for the experiment that Josh mentioned last week, because I feel like the three of us can actually tell stories, but that in trying to follow the rules of <cite>Shock:</cite> we were inhibiting our own storytelling skills.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester" title="Judson_Lester"><img alt="Judson_Lester" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://judsonlester.info/initials.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester">Judson_Lester</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67420/#Comment_67420" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-07T15:38:14+00:00" title="May  7, 2007  3:38PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (continued:)<br/><br/>Now, there is one <i>mea culpa</i> required.  I believe we were misapplying Minutae dice.  Often, as third player, we were throwing in after the result was clear to throw things off.  The visible consequence of that was the escalations were more frequent than they might otherwise have been, although I think not <em>much</em> more frequent, since only the Antagonist doesn't have a choice about which dice he's going to use.  And we did agree, escalations occurred far too frequently.  My mild mannered horticulturist was choking officious suits right and left, and shooting his way into office structures.<br/><br/>My take away: I think I would like the game that Joshua had in mind when he wrote <cite>Shock:</cite> I'd love to see a second edition with more pages devoted to clearly laying out how the game works.  I'd also like to see a clearer line drawn between the Grid, the Protagonists and Antagonists, Praxis Scales and scene framing.  I'd like to see unique Features be more involved resolving conflicts (maybe you need to name a specific Feature?) and likewise for Antagonists (or else rename Antagonist Features.)  I'd like all of the single sentence advice, (e.g. what an escalation is, how Story Goal relates to scene framing) expanded into its own subsection.  And for heaven's sake, back off on Protagonist credits.  They only apply once you've played through a whole story, and until then they're just confusing.  Until then, I don't feel like <cite>Shock:</cite> as published is a finished game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester" title="Judson_Lester"><img alt="Judson_Lester" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://judsonlester.info/initials.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester">Judson_Lester</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67451/#Comment_67451" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-07T17:56:27+00:00" title="May  7, 2007  5:56PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And now: comedy.\n<blockquote><cite> Joshua A C Newman, on The Forge</cite>Am I communicating this clearly?<br/><br/>If not, please come to my house so I can demonstrate.<br/><br/>N.B.

I've played it several times with several groups, of varying sizes. I have played many different games of Shock:<br/><br/>Were I to sit down with you, though, I'm putting money on the bet that we've been playing differnet games. I've had to make interpretation decisions many times about the text. So, here is some stuff:<br/><br/>-I agree that it's unclear how to make the grid prevalent, other than 'hm, I suppose I should incorporate colonialism, hey?" There's no advice on framing it into situations and scenes.<br/><br/>-Minutiae dice. It says on page 29 "roll 1d4 to use at your discretion to effect the outcome of the Conflict with Minutiae". This is for anyone without an involved *tagonist. Then on the next page, "Only one player may effect the outcome in a given turn, though other players may give their dice if they approve of another player's Minutia and may add to it while doing so". And I'm like... WTF does that mean? And why is only one player able to effect teh outcome, regardless of what it means?<br/><br/>-I agree that Praxis become less cool and more limiting over time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67559/#Comment_67559" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-08T09:33:02+00:00" title="May  8, 2007  9:33AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Playing definitely felt like "everybody sits in a circle kicking each other in the nuts and yelling 'Bang!'"  In fact, I think about two-thirds of the way through the game we made that comment in the game.  To me, the game suffered a similar problem that <em>Polaris</em> hits: there's so much focus on presenting bangs and making the characters miserable that there is not much actual <em>roleplaying</em> involved.  Now to Joshua's credit, the game calls itself a fiction game and not a roleplaying game, so this may just be an inappropriate expectation on my part.  But even when we got to the tragic end of my character, when she was beaten to death by her own children, the resolution of the plotline seemed pretty hollow.  I did not get a chance to really connect with my character in any meaningful way, and I don't think that is because we were ignoring any mechanics that would have helped me do that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

I'm comfortable with that.</p>\n<p>Now, calling both "Features" when there's an apparent mechanical distinction between them, well, I've got to think about that. Ron pointed that out, too.

We were pleased with how we'd related the world we'd created with the Grid to our Praxis Scales, but over the course of the game we were less enthralled. We had a lot of "oh wait, I need to pick a scale" after we rolled dice, and we came to think that it was because we didn't feel much of a connection between conflicts and the Scales we chose to resolve them. Maybe that had to do with the Scales we chose? But all in all, there wasn't much in the way of advice to warn us off the ones we did choose.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Uh, that has to do with an inefficiency in the way I designed the game, actually. It turns out that it works much better if you design the Grid, then write down Features and Links, <em>then</em> make Praxes. You've got a much better idea how your characters will act that way.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Now, here's the thing Shock: did really well: there's a strong, tight reward cycle on presenting bangs to other players. I really enjoyed handing Mark interesting situations, and he certainly seemed to enjoy having his Protagonist's kidney harvested and legs amputated. I don't know how much those activities we enjoyed by Mark and Josh in their respective roles, but they seemed to being enjoying themselves, and the d10/d4 mechanic certainly attached a Skinner-like reward to presenting suck around the table. Once we started, it was hard to stop.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Thanks! That's the real core of the game, there: choosing d10s and d4s. There never seem to be enough dice to take away the tension.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Now, there is one mea culpa required. I believe we were misapplying Minutae dice. Often, as third player, we were throwing in after the result was clear to throw things off. The visible consequence of that was the escalations were more frequent than they might otherwise have been, although I think not much more frequent, since only the Antagonist doesn't have a choice about which dice he's going to use. And we did agree, escalations occurred far too frequently. My mild mannered horticulturist was choking officious suits right and left, and shooting his way into office structures.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Ha ha ha!</p>\n<p>Um, escalation happens a lot when one or more of these things is happening: 1, Your Praxes are near the middle of the scale; 2, there are three Audience players; 3, you're never throwing the contest \xe2\u20ac\u201d remember, you can use any die you like, and that gets you another die for the rest of the game.</p>\n<p>I also recommend this: if someone's risking a Link, Minuti\xc3\xa6 don't matter; the Audience doesn't roll those dice.

It says on page 29 "roll 1d4 to use at your discretion to effect the outcome of the Conflict with Minutiae". This is for anyone without an involved *tagonist. Then on the next page, "Only one player may effect the outcome in a given turn, though other players may give their dice if they approve of another player's Minutia and may add to it while doing so". And I'm like... WTF does that mean? And why is only one player able to effect teh outcome, regardless of what it means?</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>You, Josh, Judson and I are playing. Josh and Judson are in a conflict. You and I both roll our d4 to add Minuti\xc3\xa6 - you get a 1 and I get a 4. You want to change the result so the Protag fails because you're that kind of guy, but you only got a 1, which isn't enough to make him fail. I don't have any ideas about what to do, so you say, "Hey, OK, so the Mayoral Council (a Minutia) convenes to figure out whether to exile him from the space station." I say, "Oh, OK!" so I put my die down and say, "What he said."</p>\n<p>Only one player can affect the outcome at a time because if more than one could, the Protag and Antag's dice would be valueless. If our dice total 7 or 8, there is literally no roll that could make any difference. Given that there's probably more than 1 showing on a d4 already, it's probably more like a 6, 7, or 8. So there's a 33% chance that the choices made during the conflict will be moot.</p>\n<p>Or, more succinctly: the scene is about the Protagonist and what the Angagonist is doing to hir. Concentrating too much on Minuti\xc3\xa6 lends too much weight to the morally nonexistent world and dampens the ability for the *Tags to challenge each other to make statements.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>-I agree that Praxis become less cool and more limiting over time.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>See the above solution about when to assign them.

In fact, I think about two-thirds of the way through the game we made that comment in the game. To me, the game suffered a similar problem that Polaris hits: there's so much focus on presenting bangs and making the characters miserable that there is not much actual roleplaying involved. Now to Joshua's credit, the game calls itself a fiction game and not a roleplaying game, so this may just be an inappropriate expectation on my part. But even when we got to the tragic end of my character, when she was beaten to death by her own children, the resolution of the plotline seemed pretty hollow.

A lot of them were entirely satisfactory, and you should read contentment, even joy in any silences.<br/><br/>On to specific replies:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C. Newman</cite>Shock: is intended to be played out of the book, but that's not how things worked out in many cases. Some people play the game and play it right, others have a rough time. It's clearly presentation, since the game seems to work reliably when the players do what I expect them to do.</blockquote>\nOne thing to keep in mind is that when we're playing a game at LA Gamers, it's more like a close reading than for pure entertainment purposes.  We're self-critical about our own assumptions about the text, and as a result we're more likely to trip over ambiguities and omissions in the rules.  I know I have a tendency when I'm just playing for fun to fill in missing or forgotten details, which almost always results in entertaining play, but might not be the game as presented.  Or, for that matter, as intended.  <br/><br/>So, I think we were certainly more likely to discover holes in the text than most people.  I wouldn't read my criticisms as suggestive that Shock: isn't fun, or is unplayable or whatever.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C. Newman</cite>Um, escalation happens a lot when one or more of these things is happening: 1, Your Praxes are near the middle of the scale; 2, there are three Audience players; 3, you're never throwing the contest \xe2\u20ac\u201d remember, you can use any die you like, and that gets you another die for the rest of the game.</blockquote>\nI'd strongly recommend a clear indication on the "middling Praxes make for more escalation" front, because that's way on the counter-intuitive side.  On reflection, Gardener Peng had a 4 and a 6, I think, which might be why he was such a madman.  But I expect a character uncommitted to any particular Praxis to be <em>more</em> stable, not less.  I don't think it's worth reworking any mechanics, but some clear advice on picking Praxis values: "a high or a low Praxis number lead to a character being more grounded, while non-committal Praxis choices lead to more extreme behavior" or something.<br/><br/>(And a further reflection: might there be some feedback on Praxis values, so that escalations push you towards the ends, and  pushes you towards the middle?)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C. Newman</cite>(on choosing Shocks and Issues) Come up with a bunch. The players will vote by sticking their Protags somewhere. Alternately, come up with one Shock: and one fewer Issue than the number of players. It doesn't matter, so long as the players follow the rules for which spots they can occupy.</blockquote>\nOne thought we had (which is echoed by things I've since seen elsewhere) was that unused Shocks and Issues could transmute into Minutae and Features, respectively.  <br/><br/>I'd like to see both procedures spelled out and made clear, possibly to the point of having numbered steps.  And give us an explanation of why we would choose one over the other.  I've seen you talk about the single Shock method as preventing the Tomorrowland effect - and you mention that our Shocks did "conflict."  What would conflicting Shocks look like, and why wouldn't you want them?  (I think it's possible that you know way more about this game than you think you do.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C. Newman</cite>That's a brake on the game. I've never seen players have a hard time coming up with in-character stuff to do. The important part is writing down the new thing. You get to see a new piece of the Protag from the inside when you do that.</blockquote>\nThe flip side was that we saw less of who each other's Protags were, and that hindered Antagonism.  (A specific issue I had was that Mark, who's Antag I was playing, doesn't have the greatest handwriting in the world, so it's difficult to glance at his sheet for inspiration.  I didn't see his Polylingual Feature until postmortem.) \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C. Newman</cite>back off on Protagonist credits.</blockquote>Erm. Hm. It's come up before, and you might be right. How, exactly, to present it is tough. Thanks.<br/>I think all you do is not talk about them until you get to the section on ending story arcs.  Then you say "trade in Features for Protag Credits, which are like Antag Credits, except you spend them for more dice in a scene where your Protag is."  It needs way less explanation than it gets.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C. Newman</cite>Look, I want to be able to share responsibility here, but you said, in summary,<br/><br/>" We made a character about a certain thing. Then we mooted that thing. Then we didn't know what to do with the character."<br/><br/>It's your job as Antag player to make sure that the stuff you're throwing at the Protag is about that. That's what the Grid is for. See page 34, "How to Play an Antagonist". On 35, it says, "Always pay attention to the Protagonist\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Story Goal, Issue, and Shock. If you don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t know what to do, use one of them to push on hir." That's an important job.</blockquote>\nLet me suggest then that it should be pushed harder in the text.  My reading was very much "At a loss for what to do?  Then look at Story Goal, Issue, Shock."   And when Josh wasn't sure how to get started on Peng, that was the advice we referenced.  <br/><br/>It seems like The Shock: in Josh's Mind has pushing towards Story Goal, and addressing Issue and Shock as a core purpose of the Antag player.  Which I can't find in the text.<br/><br/>One thing that occurred to me: shouldn't there be a invalid intent rule: "an intent cannot moot a Protag's connection to their Shock or Issue."  Which then begs the question "what connection does a Protag have to their Shock?  Ditto their Issue?"  Maybe those sound like dumb questions, but I think we would have been better served if they'd been asked and answered, even if the answer is (as I believe is the case) "there's no hard and fast rule, but you need to be able to agree that there's a connection - owner gets final say on what counts."<br/><br/><hr style="width: 75%;"/><br/><br/>And now the thing I'll probably regret: if you need a proofreader for mechanics, I'll volunteer.  And I think I could talk LA Gamers into a play-test based on the second edition rules.
