A woman player was relating her experience from the previous year, when she had been convinced to run <i>Tales of the Fisherman's Wife</i>.  For those of you who don't know this game \u2014 and I didn't, not really \u2014 here's the description from designer Julia Ellingboe's site:\n<blockquote><i>Tales of the Fisherman\u2019s Wife</i> is a quick two-four player game inspired by ukiyo-e art and Japanese ghost stories. When the Fisherman leaves for sea, he and his Wife exchange 6 words to weave a story while they are apart. The Wife creates a story from his 6 words, which she tells him when he returns. But the Fisherman and his Wife have caught the attention of otherworldly beings who try to seduce, possess (or supplant), devour, or serve them. While the Fisherman fishes, the \u201cWife\u201d player plays the part of the being attached to him, and the Fisherman player plays the being attached to the wife. Players take turns playing out what happens while the lovers are apart and vulnerable to the demons or spirits. When they reunite, one of them may not be what she seems.</blockquote>\nBasically <i>Tales of the Fisherman's Wife</i> can (and likely may) contain content that could be considered sexual, if not necessarily sexually explicit.  Anyone who's run or played the game can feel free to correct me on that point.<br/><br/>Anyway, I assume that the listing said something about it being an adults-only game and the general subject matter was out there.  So the GM's standing at the table getting ready for her session when a male player approached her and said, "Is this the porn game?"<br/><br/>As you can imagine, this immediately creeped the GM out, but she continued with the game anyway.  The player in question, however, definitely grooved on sexual content and introduced it to the game in an uncomfortable manner.  The game was played through, but the GM said she was texting away to her significant other (who was back at their room) saying, "Please save me," and the like.<br/><br/>Now it's funny that he asked, "Is this the porn game?"  That's the amusing part of the story.  What's less amusing was that the GM felt obligated, for whatever reason, to continue a game in which a player was doing things that made her uncomfortable.  Pretty much everybody I've related this tale to have said, "I wouldn't have done that," or "I would have shut him down the minute he asked me about porn," but I wonder if the dynamics were changed because the GM was female and the player was male.  By which I mean to say that the male player may have just expected the female GM to accommodate his perviness whereas he might not have had the same expectation of a male GM.<br/><br/>Am I completely off-base thinking this?  Are male players (of which I am one) putting burdens on female players and/or GMs that we wouldn't place on other males, or am I reading too much into this one incident, one that I only know of secondhand?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363362/#Comment_363362" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T10:00:25+00:00" title="February 28, 2012 10:00AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Obviously the anecdote could have happened any which way. What you describe is possible in our fallen world, but it is equally possible for any given micro-climate of roleplayers to be socially even-handed. Asking about the totality of the matter is meaningless, at most it is possible to point at some specific social circles and say that yes/no, these specific people here are / are not even-handed in social relations. For things to be otherwise would require roleplaying as a practice to somehow prevent or self-select only chauvinists or only feminists, and this is clearly not the case.<br/><br/>Playing <i>Tales of the Fisherman's Wife</i> in a con slot with strangers, now that takes some balls.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363364/#Comment_363364" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T10:02:23+00:00" title="February 28, 2012 10:02AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Playing<i>Tales of the Fisherman's Wife</i>in a con slot with strangers, now that takes some balls.</blockquote>\nThat's for damn sure.

I mean, the mere mention of hentai and tentacle prints from the edo period are, um, porn. I might ask if it's a porn game jokingly, or make the easy association with porn, even though it's not intended to be quite that explicit (as far as I know). If the guy was being creepy in the game, Imma go ahead and say that's not cool and a different situation. But what constitutes creepy in sexual/gaming situations?<br/><br/>I've had this discussion a lot actually. It's complicated. If I was going to be party to a sexual game, I might assume everyone there is ok with porn. I might know a bit about the sexual stuff wrapped up in mythology and fairy tales (have you ever read the original Little Red Riding Hood? Go look up that kinky voyeuristic stuff), and the history The Fisherman's Wife is talking about. I might also guess people understand gender roles and power exchange. But... those would all be assumptions. I wouldn't actually know unless I laid out clear boundaries, or asked when people seemed to get uncomfortable if something was ok with them, or how far to go. <br/><br/>When I first ran Apocalypse World, about half my group was clearly uncomfortable using the sex moves. I kept telling them "It's fade to black! You don't have to describe anything! Look, if you do it, you get cool rewards!" But for them, even the implication of sex in a game makes them a little uncomfortable. Hilariously, rape jokes are totally cool. But real intimacy, real relationship drama... my group's not so good at it. Afterward, they were kinda laughing about it like "Kira totally expected us to do the sex moves, and she just didn't realize we're prudes!" These were all the men at the table, by the way. The women were totally comfortable with it (and some of the guys too, but the only ones that took issue were men).<br/><br/>I think to a certain extent it is a gender thing. I think lots of times women are more comfortable getting into sex and relationships at the table. It's been my experience that that's the case, anyway, so it's totally biased. I also think there's the cultural implication that if men are talking about porn, they're creepers. If women talk about porn, they're totally cool.<br/><br/>Regardless of gender, often times people will try to "inflict their fetish" on other people. They'll talk endlessly about how they love anal sex, or how they're poly and go into explicit details, or constantly compliment you on your shoes with a knowing eyebrow waggle. It's true, some people are just creepers about it. Or awkward. Especially at cons, the awkward is usually what's doing it, not their malicious intent. So if you find someone Inflicting Their Fetish on you, just put em in line by telling them to cut it out, cause even though you're totally cool with it, that's just way inappropriate right there and then.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363402/#Comment_363402" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T10:55:11+00:00" title="February 28, 2012 10:55AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sam!, you could have just gone to the source...  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>This was a game that Seraphina ran last year.  She facilitated it, my wife and i were in it, and the fourth and UNNAMED participant shambled in towards play time with that line.  There were a number of other creepy and absurd things that happened during that session [buy me a beer some con and i'll lay it all out for you in its con-thulhu glory].

That's the amusing part of the story.  What's less amusing was that the GM felt obligated, for whatever reason, to continue a game in which a player was doing things that made her uncomfortable.  Pretty much everybody I've related this tale to have said, "I wouldn't have done that," or "I would have shut him down the minute he asked me about porn," but I wonder if the dynamics were changed because the GM was female and the player was male.  By which I mean to say that the male player may have just expected the female GM to accommodate his perviness whereas he might not have had the same expectation of a male GM.<br/><br/>Am I completely off-base thinking this?  Are male players (of which I am one) putting burdens on female players and/or GMs that we wouldn't place on other males, or am I reading too much into this one incident, one that I only know of secondhand?</blockquote>\nThere's always social dynamic about a situation that can't be read by just the text description.  So basically, yeah, it is definitely possible that the player introducing sexually explicit material was doing so on the basis of the GM being female.  Generally speaking the dynamics are definitely changed that way.  <br/><br/>On the other hand, my general experience is that women players are just as likely to add in sexually explicit material as men.  In my run of Hellcats &amp; Hockeysticks at the last AmberCon NorthWest, there was a woman player introducing sexual material that some other players were a little uncomfortable with.  For that matter, I've had mainly male games where we edged on uncomfortableness by having sexual material among the men.  <br/><br/>So I think the broad issue is how to handle the communication, which is shared responsibility on both sides.  The person being made uncomfortable should express that discomfort, while the person introducing content should read that discomfort and adjust.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363458/#Comment_363458" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T12:38:06+00:00" title="February 28, 2012 12:38PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2012 12:42PM by Paul_T.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: anansigirl</cite>So if you find someone Inflicting Their Fetish on you, just put em in line by telling them to cut it out, cause even though you're totally cool with it, that's just way inappropriate right there and then.</blockquote>\nI'm pretty sure there's a move for this in <i>Monsterhearts</i>...<br/><br/>I suspect we, as a society, could use a lot more tools and education around avoiding creepy and awkward behaviour.

I say Wolf, for all wolves are not of the same sort; there is one kind with an amenable disposition \u2013 neither noisy, nor hateful, nor angry, but tame, obliging and gentle, following the young maids in the streets, even into their homes.

It might just be that the story details are incomplete, but it doesn't sound like the guy's play was somehow outside the possible scope of the game -- it was just outside the scope of what the GM was comfortable with in that particular situation, and (probably?) outside the generally-assumed norms for how far one would take such play in a con environment.<br/><br/>So yeah, I dunno, the "perviness factor" seems to be an addition to the story, based on what was actually described, but obviously if the GM felt it was pervy, then it was a problem regardless. It's not obvious though that the player in question felt like what he was doing was pervy or inappropriate -- but it's hard to say, since we don't really know how strong the 'omg get me out of here' signals were from the GM.<br/><br/>As for the generalized case, I think Eero covered it pretty well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363463/#Comment_363463" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T12:50:04+00:00" title="February 28, 2012 12:50PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2012 12:50PM by Joli.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I read the story, second-hand and through text, of course it's impossible to know exactly what the real dynamic was. But walking up out of the blue and asking "Is this the porn game?" (not, "Is this A porn game?", or "is this that Fisherman's Wife game" or even "Is this the Japanese octopus sex game?") says to me that this guy is just looking for "a porn game, any porn game," rather than being on board and enthusiastic for this specific game and what it's about. And that's a warning sign.<br/><br/>Being very blunt and abrupt, with strangers, and not taking the time to go through the niceties of introduction and social patter, is also a warning sign. there's an attitude that comes up i convention stories, roughly, "I'm just here to play a game and the people playing it don't matter come on let's get to it." This looks a bit like that.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363475/#Comment_363475" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T13:28:26+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  1:28PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Really, it's impossible to tell much from a snippet of text.  <br/><br/>To me, just asking, "Is this the X game?" by itself doesn't read as blunt, abrupt, or disinterested in the specifics of the game.

No need to name names, I just want to hear how the game went, and what they story was. <br/><br/>Second, I think it's totally legitimate to ask if <i>Fisherman's Wife</i>, or any other game that probably contains sexual content, if it's a porn game. Asking that specifically won't get you much helpful information. Try asking if a game involves lots of sex, explicit on screen sex, if a game allows for sex to be off-screen, etc., will get you a lot more information, and won't make you sound so pervy. But if you go to play a game and you don't wish to play a sex game, it's a good idea to ask what you want to get out of any game. Same goes for gratuitous violence and language. <br/><br/>Third, Fisherman's Wife at a con? When I run it, I generally ask people what flavor they want to play (see above). You can have a hot, and sexy game, you can have a creepy game, or you can have a bit of both. (I suggest that in the text, too) I've played it several times with larger groups and sex barely came up, but it was creepy and scary. Heck, this weekend, I'm going to run a larp based on Fisherman's Wife. Several players have specifically asked that sex and lust themes be toned down (because I asked), so we're accentuating the horror, the creepy, and the weird. There will be an octopus though. Most games I've played, however, do not involve octopuses. There's no, "You must have an octopus in the story" rule. As a rule, unless it's consensual among all parties, I wouldn't impose my alleged octopus fetish on players any more than I already have by having written a game inspired by an image of a woman having sex with an octopus. If others consent, you could probably play out some your own fetishes with the game, though. Or not.<br/><br/>Fourth, Fisherman's Wife is inspired by one particular ukiyo-e woodcut, and is based less on the characters you find in Japanese folk tales, Edo era "pop culture" as Andy mentioned. (This may be stating the obvious, but modern anime and manga very frequently draws on the same source material.) Thus, I do intend to include one ukiyo-e image of fisherman repelling a kappa using that auspicious move, the fart attack. Kappas hate farts. <br/><br/>Fifth, in my own gaming experiences, I've never really seen a gender difference when it comes to who introduces sexual or violent themes in games. When I play with people I have never really played with, I make sure we declare our lines and veils, and allow room for undeclared lines and veils. With people I have played with, people who know my lines and whose lines I know, we don't always establish them in the beginning, but if something squicks a player out, we move the issue to a field less squicky. <br/><br/>And finally, game's not out yet. There's some more illustrations in the works, I'll put it all together, and will publish at some point, God willing, this year.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/msphina" title="msphina"><img alt="msphina" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/msphina">msphina</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363553/#Comment_363553" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T16:30:39+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  4:30PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So funny story, finding this here. That was me. I was that GM.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the compliment about my lady-testicles, Eero. I appreciate it. To be honest, I had no idea what the content of that game could be like, going into it. I had only played it once before, with friends, and nothing terrible had happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome back story: I wanted games that would be easy to run for my first con as a GM. And you can't say that "Tales" isn't easy, at least. Really, I could have left all of my players to the wolves and gone upstairs and they would have handled it just fine. I had never dealt with the whole concept of "lines and veils" in a con situation, I hadn't been given an idea of how to deal with a player who was making me uncomfortable, and I was quite honestly stymied. I wanted everyone to have fun and to get from the situation what they had come for. I certainly didn't want people leaving my game and feeling cheated, or unhappy. And I was acutely aware of the fact that the con community is a small one and I would likely see all of these people again. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, the game, though uncomfortable, was not complete agony. There were some high points, and the other players honestly pulled it out of the fire by being quite frankly wonderful about the whole thing. My boyfriend did eventually come down and kind of buffer the situation for me, which was good. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfterwards, while my friends did laugh at me about it, I learned some serious lessons from them about how to be a good GM - at a con and in general - and how to deal with difficult players. Of course, now that I have those lessons under my belt, a situation like that will likely never arise again.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the record, though, addressing the original question that Sam had posted, I did not feel as though I was being pressured because he was male and I was female. I felt pressured mostly because I didn't know where the line was for me, as the GM. I wasn't sure if I should just say "Get out. You're making me uncomfortable," or if I should get a con official, or what. And, as I said above, I was aware of the kind of ripples that me handling the situation badly could have in such a small community. The only difference in the situation had I been male might have been that he wouldn't have stuck around - or maybe he wouldn't have signed up for the game? who knows - had I turned out to be male.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo anyway, it was a learning experience. Lines and veils. Lines and veils. No weird manatee man for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/msphina" title="msphina"><img alt="msphina" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/msphina">msphina</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363555/#Comment_363555" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T16:31:47+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  4:31PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By the way, he did say "Is this a porn game?" not "Is this THE porn game."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363565/#Comment_363565" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T16:44:09+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  4:44PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: msphina</cite>By the way, he did say "Is this a porn game?" not "Is this THE porn game."</blockquote>\nOut of curiousity, do you remember what you said in response?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/msphina" title="msphina"><img alt="msphina" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/msphina">msphina</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363572/#Comment_363572" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T16:53:58+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  4:53PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2012 8:50PM by Andy.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            jhkim,<br/><br/>I blustered.

The players have specific (and esthetically not unpleasing) procedures to signal discomfort, cut short uncomfortable scenes or halt the game to have a timeout. The game is presented to prospective players with clear signals that this is 1) totally explicit, 2) serious drama not light sexual entertainment and 3) violence and abuse are off limits.<br/><br/>There's a couple of other, more light hearted games with sexual themes and content too. There are also games that will let you play with abuse themes to your heart's content.<br/><br/>Anyway I played Tales at Fastaval in 2010 (it rocked! and I can't wait to get my hands on the finished thing), and despite som heavy(!) innuendo, it boggles my mind that it is taken as porn simply because there might be nipples!?!

The antagonist is not always a wolf, but sometimes an ogre or a \u2018bzou\u2019 (werewolf), making these tales relevant to the werewolf-trials (similar to witch trials) of the time (e.g. the trial of Peter Stumpp).[6] The wolf usually leaves the grandmother\u2019s blood and meat for the girl to eat, who then unwittingly cannibalizes her own grandmother. Furthermore, the wolf was also known to ask her to remove her clothing and toss it into the fire.[7] In some versions, the wolf eats the girl after she gets into bed with him, and the story ends there.[8] In others, she sees through his disguise and tries to escape, complaining to her "grandmother" that she needs to defecate and would not wish to do so in the bed. The wolf reluctantly lets her go, tied to a piece of string so she does not get away. However, the girl slips the string over something else and runs off.<br/><br/>In these stories she escapes with no help from any male or older female figure, instead using her own cunning.</blockquote>\nThat particular line is especially interesting, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/gravity" title="gravity"><img alt="gravity" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/gravity">gravity</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363957/#Comment_363957" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T13:37:46+00:00" title="February 29, 2012  1:37PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I usually don't have an issue with sex in games, and often play towards it.

I mean that in a totally non-ironic way.<br/><br/>My convention funtimes are precious moments wrested from the jaws of drudgery and tedium. Without some (social) reward in sight, I won't spend my time educating people that, most likely, many others have tried and failed to educate before. If you do, great. Best of luck. If I were a gambler, I wouldn't bet on your success, but I would be cheering you. Now if some problem person were a friend, or friend or family of a friend, I might give it a shot, but otherwise you'll only see me educating people when I'm hosting a seminar (which I do, because it IS socially rewarding).<br/><br/>Also, people need words to put to people being obnoxiously inappropriate, to call them out and stop them. If we are unwilling to actually apply words (or apply words that don't really fit, like "shy" when people are acting like assholes), people like the totally unhypothetical gamemaster mentioned in the OP are put unreasonably on the spot when they want to stop people from spoiling games with totally inappropriate behaviour.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Meserach</cite>From what I can judge based on the descriptions here, "shy" isn't quite right but "socially maladjusted" and perhaps "possessed of some kind of psychological syndrome or disorder" might also be appropriate. (I'm saying this as someone who themselves has Asperger syndrome). Whether those descriptions make them deserving of your sympathy or not is up to the individual.</blockquote>This kind of pisses me off.<br/><br/>Thing is, I have several gamer friends and acquaintances with Aspergers, and they don't act like assholes. So I can't speak conclusively about other kinds of non-neurotypicals, but when aspies act like assholes it's usually because they're assholes, not because they're aspies. And I've heard Aspergers referenced a LOT to explain or excuse selfish and inconsiderate behaviour.<br/><br/>This is not to say that aspies don't have other issues, like being stressed out by people touching them and expecting constant eye contact, but that's a whole other kettle of fish.

For some, nipples are enough, for others (like myself) it's porn if the primary point is a boner/wetness. Like I said earlier in the thread, I've written a game with a lot more than just nipples, but since it uses sex to talk about feelings and alienation, I call it a game with sex in it rather than a porn game.

If you do, great.<br/><span style="font-family: Courier;"><br/>I think the "non-neurotypical" comments here are not excusing people for being inconsiderate, but just pointing out something about the nature of gamers as a group. When it comes to inappropriate sexual content at the table (which includes narrative fixation on body parts and staring), it's best to presume poor social skills and ignorance, instead of malice. I sympathize with Troels Ken since convention play is a peculiar case where time is at a premium. Someone who is obnoxiously twisting things around to have fun at other people's expense deserves to be called a creep and sent packing.<br/><br/>Full disclosure: I was the boob-staring guy, when I was 17. I didn't even know I was doing it, and would have stopped if someone had gently pointed it out to me. I know you're there to play a game, but often That Guy is me. Well done, Mcdaldno. An uncomfortable conversation about something that you think should be obvious is <b>not</b> how you want to spend your leisure time, but it seems like everyone here has been in a situation where this kind of intervention would have been helpful. Good on you for giving That Guy/me a minute of your time.<br/><br/>We may be wandering far from the original topic though, which was more about player expectations of sexual content/erotica/pornography in certain games.</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365274/#Comment_365274" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-05T12:00:36+00:00" title="March  5, 2012 12:00PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whew, for a second there I thought Abel was confessing to being <i>the</i> guy we were talking about!
