So I went pursuing GMless/GMfull designs, only to find their focus was too far away from what I was looking for. I like to be able to express myself creatively and eventually learned to impro and enjoy playing unsafe, but I couldn't ask the same from my players.<br/><br/>It's not that I don't trust their creativity, we are used to write comic books together and brainstorm stuff, it's mostly that when checking GMless games I found most of the ones I read asked for creative input in a way that didn't helped players prone to blank page syndrome or/due to analysis paralysis. It's certainly a skill that can be learnt and it doesn't mean you need to make quality material just to play, you can keep your input simple and later build over other players input; the quality material will then appear by itself as a byproduct of engaging the system. However it was mostly how those systems ask stuff from the players the thing that ticked me off.<br/><br/>As for GMless games, those that come with integrated fixed themes and viewpoints of those themes are definitely the best, but then I never found one with a theme or viewpoint I'd like to play, and had to accept that my own tastes on this tend to change over the course of a game -often depending on the mood of the group- and that I was looking for versatility more than anything. <br/><br/>So I ended up going for the easiest solution: go back to trad GMing but integrating all the things I learned from GMfull games I could, like:<br/><br/>- Brainstorming the setting with the players (manage to reduce those to 8 questions)<br/>- Ask the players about each choice they took in their character sheet, to develop more content from there and add it to the setting.<br/>- Handling the players some keywords for them to turn it into rumours, which they can follow until they become a quest.<br/>- Mountain-witch the players when I had no answers as a GM.<br/>- Keep building upon player input (like consequences of the PC actions, etc) through the game.<br/>- Play to find out.<br/><br/>It has worked for me so far but I'm really interested on you vision about GMless games, I also felt that they could be better but didn't get too far exploring that path.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466388/#Comment_466388" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-20T20:57:57+00:00" title="September 20, 2017  8:57PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I admit, gmLess structures require some tradeoffs.

This way you can make PvP the focus of the game instead of putting a GM in charge of the opposition.<br/><br/>Oh, and for Microscope to work more as a trad game mostly you would just need to ditch the time-travelling mechanic and proceed in linear form.<br/><br/>I also use random tables in cards like The Quiet Year, but found out that I'd still need to rely on a bit of hidden information to keep players engaged on the exploration side of the game. That's one of the reasons I went back to GMed games too, having more than one person framing scenes is like having several writers making a book: sure, everyone can work together but the writing style of each one is going to be entirely different. Having none at all creates a void filled only with raw information. I prefer the narration to have a single voice, even if it's not Morgan Freeman; but all this is just me and my narrative OCD, this single voice thing isn't actually needed to enjoy the game and depending on the group, that cacophony can become a choir.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466395/#Comment_466395" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-20T23:28:07+00:00" title="September 20, 2017 11:28PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> please do elaborate.

I think I have some  very good insight and solutions into some of the problems; however, some are easier to solve <i>well</i> than others. One that folks have yet to mention is <i>how to deal with information that is supposed to be keep secret from the players</i>. It's not the biggest issue at all for me, but it is an issue for the form\u2014I've thought of some solutions for it, but it hasn't been a priority. The fact that those of us who play a lot of these games, (especially the collaborative GMless Story Games type of games), have a lot of consensus regarding what the issues are, is evidence that there is in fact issues in the form and dissatisfaction with certain aspects of it.

I think I don't really get the special distinction, to me being GMless is just an arbitrary structuration choice, same as any other. I am not convinced that prioritizing it as a design paradigm makes any more sense than doing "dice pool mechanics", which some people used to think was this really special distinction that set a game apart from others, once upon a time.<br/><br/>My own answer to this question comes in the form of utility statements: there are purposes for which various kinds of GMless structures are better than having a GM would be. For example:<br/><b>*</b> If the goal of a game is to boot-strap a group of players into a shape where they're all equally capable and committed to playing the game, then you will probably want something similar to a boardgame's structure: a facilitator exists, yes, because it's useful for somebody to master the rules in advance, but the end-goal is for them to discard the role once everybody's on board. This is better than having a GM because of the infantilizing influence that the GM's presence generally has on the creative dynamics of the gaming process.<br/><b>*</b> If your subject matter and goals benefit from pure, unadulterated creative input from many different players, delivered right there at the table and possibly judged right way by the rest of the group, then taking the GM out of the equation probably heightens the responsibility and removes a player who could act as an unwanted focal point in lieu of the actually contributing player. In other words, when you don't have a GM you actually have to take that other player's contribution seriously, because there is nobody else there legitimizing or delegitimizing it.<br/><b>*</b> The GM-based traditional rpg structure has many advantages and only a moderate procedural footprint, which actually makes it a great framework for doing various sorts of things - it is no news outside gaming that having a chairman in team exercises is usually the way to go. However, when your game definitely needs to go <i>even lighter</i>, a GMless structure can get you there even faster and with more simplicity than adding a GM could. A similar phenomenon occurs at the high end, theoretically, but in my exper\xedence a gaming group so committed that they would have a performative edge <i>without</i> the GM is so rare as to be impractical.<br/><br/>Isn't that just like dice pools? I could make up a grab-bag list of for instances for dice pools, too, to show how they're the appropriate tool for a given set of design parameters. Yet despite that, I wouldn't elevate "having a dice pool" into the guiding principle of my design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466405/#Comment_466405" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-21T03:19:17+00:00" title="September 21, 2017  3:19AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Why does being GMless entice?</p></div></blockquote>For me, it's basically two things:<br/><br/>1) If I want to roleplay and am willing to organize, but don't feel like GMing, I don't have to find a GM!<br/><br/>2) If I want to have some make-stuff-up, not-just-character-play fun, but don't feel like full-time GMing, I can!<br/><br/>I'm curious to see what others say!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466406/#Comment_466406" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-21T03:42:54+00:00" title="September 21, 2017  3:42AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 21, 2017 4:35AM by Jeff_Slater.">edited September 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> <br/>Most collaborative GMless Story Games, defined like <a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/460/defining-story-games/" rel="nofollow">this</a>, are about creating an interesting narrative and story, not advocating for a player or trying to overcome  obstacles with that character via their fictional abilities, or even always playing from their perspective.  All things are subservient to the story, all things are there to serve the story, even the characters.  If something horrible happens to my character but it makes the story really awesome, I'm almost always really into that bad thing happening to my character. That's not something you're usually shooting for in a GMed game. It's a different animal and it scratches a different itch. It takes a shift in perspective. So, in short, the GMless form does this better then the GM form. There's a lot more to it, but that's about all the time I have tonight to discuss it. Anyway, that's my take on it.

I played DnD with juvenile passion for several years as a preteen from about 79' to 82.  I then got into 5e briefly when it came out a few years ago and played a half dozen sessions with some friends.  I then discovered games like burning wheel and hillfolk, and pbta games, but never found anyone to play them with because I soon after stumbled upon gmless storygames and haven't really looked back since.  So my experience is very limited compared to many here I think...

So we're looking less at how the game is structured, and more at the creative agenda. That makes a lot more sense to me.<br/><br/>I have observed in my own game design a principle of sorts, one that has been very relevant to me when it comes to creating story-oriented games of various sorts. One might say that it's a monolithic obstacle that I have found fundamental in the sense that one has to design around it to create a good story game. Here's an attempt at putting it to words:<br/><br/><i>Authoring good stories is a specialized craft, performed by people we call "authors" or "storytellers" or some such. If your game's payoff is supposed to be "a great story", you're faced with appropriating the dual task of the author: your game now has to make the players talented storytellers, <b>and</b> it has to entertain them while they perform the author's task.</i><br/><br/>That's probably only enlightening if you happen to be in a similar creative place to mine. The reason I find the above thought fundamental is that it appears to me from experience that it is very easy to fail in making story-creation both easy and fun for the players, unless you're presuming a player base consisting of actual storytellers (who will, obviously, bring the skills and passion themselves). Much of the cultural history of roleplaying games is about the fact that not that many people are storytellers, after all.<br/><br/>There are certain established ways to combine story-creation and gaming, so it is not impossible to work with the challenge, but one has to admit that the vast majority of the ways are fundamentally work-arounds if one has the ambition of creating a pure game of story-creation for the sake of story-creation. For example, the vast oeuvre of Forgite story games rely nearly without exception on a combination of mad-libs and a type of "automatic writing" that occurs when protagonist characters are given independent advocates at the gaming table. Understanding how, precisely, these games achieve the ideal of being a fun game where story occurs is quite enlightening, I think; it's not quite that "creating story is fun", so much as certain fun activities that are closely related to storytelling happen to produce stories effortlessly as a by-product.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466409/#Comment_466409" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-21T04:16:57+00:00" title="September 21, 2017  4:16AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/davey" rel="nofollow">davey</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I can share a google doc game with anyone who wants to look at it and give me feedback.

A successful design should encapsulate the creative agenda. The form should be a tool that best enacts and fulfills the aims of the creative agenda of a particular game. So, at the micro level, it would be about discussing solutions to the issues in our gmLess games that are getting in the way of our aims; but in the largest sense, and just as important, it would be about thinking hard and in depth about and solving the different issues that we are dissatisfied with in the GMless design space at large.

It's appealing, I think, just to have even a vague sense that we are all equal participants.<br/><br/>That spins out into other features:<br/><br/>* By necessity, this usually means a lighter social footprint.<br/><br/>It's easy to put together, start up, and finish. No single person has to shoulder the burden of organizing, planning, or preparing.<br/><br/>* In play, no one person has to be "on point" at all times, the way a GM does, which makes it an easier option from the perspective of whoever would otherwise GMing.<br/><br/>* Similarly, that means that everyone has the ability to participate at any given time. You are unlikely to sit there idly - if you want to participate, these games typically allow you to do so.<br/><br/>In comparison, in a traditional, GMed game, we rely on one person constantly being under a lot of responsibility; this also means that if you're a player and two scenes have gone by where your character wasn't involved, you have to either suck it up or go to the social level to ask the group to remember to give you something to do (which can be difficult or awkward for some people/groups).<br/><br/>These are nice features for a lot of groups. Of course, they also have implications for creative agenda-type stuff. For instance, not being limited to participating in the game as one character DOES free you up to play that character in different ways, because you know that, for example, having the character sidelined doesn't also mean you don't get to play anymore.<br/><br/>Personally, my interest these days as a designer is in finding structured but still asymmetrical organizations of player responsibility. One person GMing all the time is one extreme of the spectrum, perhaps, and totally equal distributions of authority and responsibility is the other. What lies in the middle of that spectrum?

This is one of the main tradeoffs of gmLess games.<br/>No matter how you turn it around, someone has to eventually describe stuff outside the actions of their own PC.<br/>It is possible, though, to design in such a way that this is somewhat minimised, making the outCharacter moments less disruptive for the inCharacter ones.<br/>Mostly, by observing the table I noticed how some "truths" of gmLed games are actually mere "illusions" ... the idea of a pure inCharacter experience is a fairy tale people like to tell themselves, and inaccurate statement ... what really happens is: in the vast majority of cases Players are constantly sliding in and out of their characters, performing outCharacter actions and decisions and contributions.<br/>The key point that can be exploited is that it really is all about <b>a very granular spectrum of shades</b>. Different people FEEL the shift between inCharacter and outCHaracter at different moments or for different activities of for WAYS of performing such activities.<br/>Tinkering with this "tolerance" is key to have the game FEEL more inCharacter than outCharacter, and feeling is all that matters.<br/><br/>Which, unfortunately in my experience, opens the flank to a different problem.<br/>Illusions are powerful.<br/>It matters little that the actual things you do at the table are exactly the same, and you do them in the same way ... if they are <b>perceived</b> differently, and if this is a big deal for a particular Player, then the game won't feel ok for that Player no matter what.<br/><br/>But them maybe that's their problem. And anyway you can't win them all.<br/>But working on how to build the same illusion, or a different illusion, even within a gmLess structure... that might be an interesting possible venue of research <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>* Drawing stories to logical and satisfying conclusions.

This kind of stuff is not that common in general. It's mostly an illusion, a myth of gmLed play. In my experience it's much more common to hear about and epic story that is left unfinished, than to hear about the oh-so-cool conclusion of a story.<br/>And when it happens, it's all GM-magic with little to no help from the game procedures.<br/><br/>As The most common option in gmLed games is just to ignore the matter.<br/>Then a solution is to organise play in discreet segments, allowing Players and GM to give a neat closure to one quest/mission after the other.<br/>Or there is what Fate does, following somewhat defined story-archs ... these can also be neatly ended, but being somewhat "organic" and emergent, the end of an arch might open many new options and questions, rather than tidying everything up in a single bundled END.<br/><br/>The only method that is typical (but not exclusive) of gmLess structures is to just define a game-end condition ... if by that time you have a story that more or less is wrapped up, good, otherwise you wrap it up with what you have.<br/><br/>...so... yeah, it would be nice to have a defined and satisfying end to a storyline. But it's a common rpg problem, not a specific gmLess limitation.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466436/#Comment_466436" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-21T15:58:04+00:00" title="September 21, 2017  3:58PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Alessandro, I'd love to hear how FateLess goes about pursuing the traditional feel!</p></div></blockquote>\nThe feat is achieved through the use of many techniques all clockworked together.<br/>And then the "unveiled illusion" problem is always a factor.<br/>But to try and make a short list:<br/><br/>- there are strong tools in place to handle Player to Player communication, with the main goal of expediting resolutions and cutting through red tape (aka negotiations) rather than achieving absolute fairness or consensus<br/><br/>- gameplay is strictly limited to PC-pov, with a lot of emphases on individuality, personal goals, emergent character development and exploration; same goes for Setting dev and expo<br/><br/>- offCharacter contributions can often (not always) be avoided by either shifting them on other, more willing Players, or on game mechanics that then inject "from the outside" the skeleton of a contribution (which usually becomes immediately easy to fit into the fiction)<br/><br/>- the game system itself at times introduces unexpected elements<br/><br/>The end result allows Players to "just" play their own PC, anyway they feel like, even in an "egoist" and to the hilt way, without this being disruptive for the other Players.<br/>The structure constantly re-assesses and re-aligns Player desires, expectations and aesthetics.<br/>OffCharacter contributions can often be shifted away, so that you only do them when you feel like it; it's more about minimising the problem than really removing it.<br/>The structure also goes to lengths to actively avoid Player from taking a truly Director Stance, or to emerging as unofficial-GMs.<br/>Stories emerge from clear trajectory defining mechanics, and a structure that (by preventing Players to act as directors) builds events one small bit at a time. The feeling of "<i>we are telling ourselves a story</i>" is as minimised as possible.<br/><br/>The end result is a very (not completely) inCharacter experience offering a story that feels solid, perfectly tailored to your PC, with lots of surprises and twists. As if you had a <b>Good Invisible  GM</b> at the table.<br/><br/>Also, it's definitely not a light-weight pick up game.

This is true for any coherent design, but with gmLess the system cuts you much less slack.<br/>So for me, as a designer, is a much more meaningful and satisfying challenge; some things I do gmLess just for the sake of experimentation: is it POSSIBLE to do X without a GM?

(edutainment, brrr)<br/>All of this because there is no other way for a gmLess structure to work :P<br/>And by crafting the rules properly, one can seriously ease Players into such behaviours.<br/>I just love this <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>My own answer to this question comes in the form of utility statements: there are purposes for which various kinds of GMless structures are better than having a GM would be.<br/><br/>Isn't that just like dice pools?

When I post the main [gmLess+] discussion thread, I will add this thread to it, as well as a "mission statement" regarding its goals. Anyway, when I use that definition, of "Story Game," I'm just doing so in order to address a specific given context; so, for example, Eero was asking what were the advantages of the GMless form, and I used that definition in order to contextuallize <i>one</i> example. <br/><br/>I'm just as interested in all the other design spaces that you are, so if I use that definition in the future I'm only doing so for a specific purpose not in some all encompassing way; I'm as interested in designing away from that "story-prioritizing" form as I am in improving the designs within it. That's part of what I meant when I've said things like: "I'm interested in making games work that shouldn't work in the GMless Story Game space and finding novel solutions." <br/><br/>You're actually one of the people I think that can add a lot to the conversation for two reasons.  First, you've played in the form a lot and have thought about it a lot, and thought a lot about design solutions in the GMless design space, like many of us have. But just as important, I think that\u2014like me\u2014you want to question certain assumptions about that space and are willing to push in a different direction from established "doctrine." I also think, the fact that we're both passionate about expanding and innovating the form will be of help, because we know that there is a whole sea of opportunity out there and that the space is nowhere near as fully and well developed as it could be.

But that's a really good thing, it has turned this thread in some really interesting reading material! First, I'd like to mention that I love Eero's point of view about the problems in GMless games: you should actually see them as opportunities to design different stuff.<br/><br/>I'd need days to process everything that has been written so far to think a way of turning it into practical mechanics/procedures... so let's start from the top. \n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I think the main problems/issues GMless games face are:<br/>* Challenges in establishing and maintaining consistent tone (particularly across a disparate group of players with varied tastes).<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nI've playtested some experiments in this kind of challenges. Establishing and maintaining a consistent tone isn't a problem if each player participation is kept brief by the rules and some tone limitations are established at the start of the game. Just narrowing those choices a bit must be enough. Giving the players a encompassing theme, genre and tone should do the rest of the trick to give the social contract enough authority so players can self-regulate in this aspect. <br/><br/>OTOH this clash of tones can be used by the game to create a stronger impact on the players. Imagine this: each player creates one or perhaps more characters that bring their own distinctive tone to a scene. It's like having a different melody play when each character comes into the scene. The social contract regulates the tempo but otherwise the melodies are free to compete or collaborate to create a particular viewpoint of a theme. Like the epic warrior looks different when the comic relief makes a scene with him than when he talks with the dramatic character. The scene also changes when one of those is the main focus of the scene and the others act as support. <br/><br/>As a mechanic, they could choose if they either want to collaborate by having one of them provide the theme and the other the viewpoint to build the scene or if they want to compete to see which theme and viewpoint prevails. <br/><br/>Of course, all this doesn't help too much on the subject Eero mentioned:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/><i>Authoring good stories is a specialized craft, performed by people we call "authors" or "storytellers" or some such.

Something will get lost here, at least for a while until players learn from one another how\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>* So much weight placed on group consensus that communication at the table isn't always simple or smooth. WHO gets to talk WHEN, and HOW MUCH are they allowed to say?<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nCan't find who said this before in the thread (probably Eero) but here's another opportunity brought by not having a central enforced authority figure: the conversation will flow more naturally without someone there to guide it. Usually in a normal conversation we will see people changing the subject and switching from one tone to another following the path of their thoughts and mood. Here we will have the social contract (<i>we're playing a game about this subject</i>) and possibly a few mechanics to keep the conversation around the subject of the story in development. <br/><br/>Human communication is so developed that we only need to add a few guidelines in the form of ritual phrases to help things take shape. Phrases like "How do you do that?", "Describe it another way", "What do you do now?" do a lot to help without being too unfamiliar or creating an awkward situation.<br/>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>* Vincent Baker had said in the past that the purpose of RPG rules is to fruitfully maintain a conflict of interests (usually in the fiction). Freeform collaborative gaming does not do this well, or, often, at all.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nDavid is right here, if characters have conflicting interests to start with and collaborative gaming here means just playing them to give others the chance to roleplay, then the game can go on until those conflicts get resolved. By definition characters would either have opposing goals (I want to help the people overthrown the local noble, you want to help the local noble bring order to his lands), have the same non-shareable victory condition (Only one of us can be the new Baron) or have opposite methods to achieve the same objective .(you want to make the people terrified of the Baron, I want them to follow him willingly.<br/>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>* Drawing stories to logical and satisfying conclusions. Most GMless games I've seen largely depend on player skill to do this well (although some more focused games have good tools, overall this is lacking).<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nYou will definitely need a clear narrative objective and/or winning condition proposed at the start of the game to get this done, as well as a clear procedure to keep the players informed about how much playing time remains to get it done or until failure. Dividing the game in acts helps a lot here. GMed campaigns also tend to have not enough satisfying conclusions, as the GM will sometimes forget to tie loose ends or misunderstand what would be a satisfying ending for one or more players. I see this as a nice opportunity to have players narrate the epilogue for their characters as this is the perfect moment to see their expectations fulfilled, and who could be better to inform the group about those expectations than the player? Of course, the epilogue needs to be influenced and limited by whatever happened through the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466454/#Comment_466454" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-21T19:56:30+00:00" title="September 21, 2017  7:56PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>* The game makes it difficult, impossible, or awkward to play it from a first-person ("in-character") stance.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nWe would probably need for people to play more than one character anyway. You're right that full-character immersion is going to be hard to achieve but first-person play may be possible. For this to happen as a player I'll need to be able to focus on my character's emotions, motivations and resources, so I'll won't be able to go into GM mode and frame the fiction whenever my character is required to do something. I'll also need feedback from the fiction to know the effect of my character's actions and get an idea of what will do my character next. So the other players will have to frame the fiction for me and answer to my questions. <br/><br/>This is the part where things get harder to do as a group as consensus needs to be reached before giving the feedback. One approach to solve this, without going back to things like a "rotating GM" could be regulated by the ritual phrase "Yes, and..." and a couple simple mechanics to regulate intervention: <i>The first one to have an idea speaks first</i> (tested this in a PbtA game context, works better than it sounds) and <i>give the floor to whoever looks more excited about an idea</i> (which is a personal guide I use even when GMing trad games. Doubles for <i>Listen to the players</i> in that context) <br/><br/>Here you would need a bit of extra trust: most probably the information won't make sense at first, specially if the player is withholding some information to make a reveal a moment later or just taking a dramatic pause before explaining it. If it still doesn't there's still a high chance someone else a the table can give that input a twist to give it coherence, but this is rare, normally a person really excited by an idea will have whatever it takes to back it up, though words may fail them. But some group support here is usually enough to help to keep things going and it's often a natural reaction for everyone at the table.<br/><br/>I'm seeing some of this could probably work better if at all times at least one player's character isn't present on the scene, so that player can take charge of framing the scenes, answering questions about it and interpret what happens after the conflict resolution mechanic is triggered.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466456/#Comment_466456" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-21T20:40:49+00:00" title="September 21, 2017  8:40PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 22, 2017 3:46PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited September 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to clarify, the [gmLess+] tagged thread-network will include Rotating GM games and games with Asymmetric distribution of player responsibilities, because those games are in the same wheel house and have the same opportunities.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM" title="Mongrel_GM"><img alt="Mongrel_GM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM">Mongrel_GM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466458/#Comment_466458" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-21T22:31:21+00:00" title="September 21, 2017 10:31PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 21, 2017 10:32PM by Mongrel_GM.">edited September 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Jeff,<br/>I don't know that GM-less and some-shared-narrative-with-GM are any more similar than shared and "traditional."<br/><br/>In fact, having any level of GM authority to drive conflict, guide story, and resolve in a focused way is a big deal.

This actually seems most relevant to board game design, but could help in story game design too. The following was posted on a "ctmu" Facebook group. Stands for cognitive theoretic model of the universe and is a truly mind bending logical treatise on the fundamental structure of reality. All that is irrelevant however to the utility of the following info on the mathematics of decisions. I haven't yet played w the equation enough to say exactly how I'd use it...  Basically it provides a mathematical model describing analysis paralysis. here is the post (reposted without permission actually... sorry if that offends)<br/><br/>W. E. Hick (1952) devised a CRT experiment which presented a series of nine tests in which there are n equally possible choices. The experiment measured the subject's reaction time based on number of possible choices during any given trial. Hick showed that the individual's reaction time increased by a constant amount as a function of available choices, or the "uncertainty" involved in which reaction stimulus would appear next. Uncertainty is measured in "bits", which are defined as the quantity of information that reduces uncertainty by half in information theory. In Hick's experiment, the reaction time is found to be a function of the binary logarithm of the number of available choices (n). This phenomenon is called "Hick's Law" and is said to be a measure of the "rate of gain of information." The law is usually expressed by the formula RT= a+b log _2(n+1), where a and b are constants representing the intercept and slope of the function, and n is the number of alternatives.[8] The Jensen Box is a more recent application of Hick's Law.[1] Hick's Law has interesting modern applications in marketing, where restaurant menus and web interfaces (among other things) take advantage of its principles in striving to achieve speed and ease of use for the consumer.[9]"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davey" title="davey"><img alt="davey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/739/n2UJ50N52BV5N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davey">davey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466462/#Comment_466462" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-22T00:13:09+00:00" title="September 22, 2017 12:13AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi people.

It's an "everything but traditional RPGS" category. Or an "everything we are interested in discussing category."<br/><br/>But then I still fundamentally disagree with the definition of story game that many use. "Less focus on my character and more focus on our story" is a flimsy definition based on motivations of people at a table that more often than not can't be known. D&amp;D can be played with story motivation, happens every day. Fiasco can be played with PC drives at the forefront. Happens every day.<br/><br/>My definition would come down to where the narrative authority lies. Authority of resolution too (referee or randomization agent as final say). Shared evenly = story game.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466484/#Comment_466484" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-22T15:33:45+00:00" title="September 22, 2017  3:33PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 22, 2017 4:20PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited September 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM">@Mongrel_GM</a>, etc <br/>So, when I say Rotating GM, I mean rotating every-turn type games (that's is the standard definition of the term), and when I say Asymmetrical I mean games like Kingdom or Archipelago or Polaris where players have "dominion" over different things or have different roles...there's no central GM at all in the games I'm talking about, and they do fit your definition of story game, Mongrel. I wouldn't be including something like a PbtA game or anything with one central authority. They would be the types of games we typically play at SG SLC. Does that make sense?<br/><br/>P.S. Regarding your definition of Story Game, Mongrel. I would say GMless is a better  descriptor of shared authority than story game is. This is why I like Ben's definition of <a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/460/defining-story-games/" rel="nofollow">Story Game</a>, it's specific, coherent and technical, which makes it useful. But the definition of a Story Game isn't relevant to the [gmLess+] thing. What is relevant is that we will be discussing and working on games with no central authority. <br/><br/>As for authority distribution, I like:<br/><i>Bifurcated</i> = traditionally separated GM &amp; player distribution <br/><i>Asymmetrical</i> = "dominion" over different things and/or roles, but evenly, or nearly evenly, distributed <br/><i>Collaborative</i> = evenly distributed                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>gmLess design space - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21295/gmless-design-space/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="gmLess design space - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21295/gmless-design-space/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content='Gotcha, I probably just should have asked "asymmetrical like PbtA?" and then you would have said "no."

Plus. <br/><br/>I can agree with much of what he writes there--but not as regards Fate points and similar. Those are just a mystical extension of the PC's abilities. It's not a critical break from "adventure" games, especially since a GM still rules on how much affect that mystical ability can have.<br/><br/>My thoughts, super condensed:<br/><br/>GM = "adventure" game.<br/>GM-less = story game<br/><br/>Scene framing that doesn't ask a GM "may I?" starts bringing an "adventure" game into hybrid territory I suppose.<br/><br/>Randomized action resolution in a story game starts bringing it into hybrid territory I suppose.<br/><br/>*****<br/><br/>Ben's definition sets up more of a continuum of player interface with the game world.

It's got heavy GM authority within scenes, but a GMless/asymmetric format. (I've seen it described as "railroading made fun".)<br/><br/>I'm also thinking about more formalized variations of <i>Inconceivable</i>, with stricter rules and more defined procedures.<br/><br/>Finally, you might find games like <i>Dog Eat Dog</i> or <i>Kagematsu</i> interesting, in that they play with the "GM role" in interesting ways. The same is true of <i>Dirty Secrets</i>. (For instance, in <i>Kagematsu</i> the "GM" figure is arguably the player who portrays the focal character in the story - or, at least, the one who appears in all the scenes; I think it's very much arguable that Kagematsu isn't the protagonist of the story, but he's the most central character and gets the most "screentime".)<br/><br/><i>Rock of Tahamaat</i> is similar, in a way. Is there a GM? Kinda yes, kinda no, since he's tied to a specific character in the fiction, as well. (It's just that the character has tremendous ability to affect the fiction, too! To a certain extent, the "GM powers" are diegetic.)<br/><br/>Vincent's <i>The King is Dead</i> kinda defies this whole "your ability to affect the game isn't limited to your character" definition - not in the sense that it's wrong, but it hardly makes sense to apply that definition to the game, either as a positive or a negative, because it's structured in a totally different way.<br/><br/>This has been an interesting discussion, and I hope we can keep it going, start branching off various tangents, and so forth. I think it's one of the most (if not <i>the</i> most) interesting directions for RPG/story game design these days.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466504/#Comment_466504" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-23T02:30:55+00:00" title="September 23, 2017  2:30AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't forget <i>Serpent's Tooth</i>, where there is a GM but the other players steal their GM powers bit by bit!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466505/#Comment_466505" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-23T03:14:44+00:00" title="September 23, 2017  3:14AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Historically, reciprocal playtesting has been hard to arrange.

The reason is, I think, that most people who are interested in game development do not, most of the time, need stochastic playtest data, and you can't really get qualititative data out of blind-date playtest relationships except by accident.<br/><br/>For this reason the actually productive playtesting and studio critique relationships that I've seen have always, practically without exception, been predicated on mutual creative respect: you <i>first</i> discover somebody who respects and understands your creative vision, and <i>then</i> arrange for that person to critique or playtest your game. This then produces committed, thoughtful, high-quality critique that actually may help you further your game development. Forced blind-date playtesting is weak in comparison because the odds are that the other person doesn't really understand or appreciate your work, and they're merely going through the motions in consulting you.<br/><br/>This is why I generally recommend construing the social capital of game development in terms of on-going cultural saloons, workshops and consultative correspondence: these structures facilitate first the initial discovery process of finding like-minded consultants for your project, and then developing creative rapport and commitment to working on the project. I generally advice against all sorts of quotas and speculative mutual commitments except in the most general sense that one good deed deserves another. You do not need to promise to playtest my project for me to playtest yours; I won't playtest your game unless it is actually a worthwhile thing to do, and if it is, that certainly has nothing to do with whether it'd be useful for my game to be playtested by you.<br/><br/>People go through cycles of social and creative positioning in life, and this means that, just as David says, people are very rarely in symmetrical positions where their needs are equivalent to each other. It is very common for somebody to be deep in the headset of creating their own game, which directly impacts their ability to contribute useful support functions for another person's game development. Likewise, a person who is well-situated to offer development support in the form of playtesting and such is often not at a stage in their own game design where they would need similar development help themselves. A system that presumes reciprocy actively militates against the discovery of useful allies.<br/><br/>In a nutshell: if you have a project that could benefit from outside perspectives, I recommend putting it up, explaining where it's going, and perhaps specifying some specific concerns and questions. If luck is with you, you'll attract somebody who gets what you're trying to do, and they'll be able to help you going forward. This is potentially much more useful than participating in some sort of playtest-secret-santa that ends with you playtesting something stupid, and somebody stupid playtesting your game, after which neither of you has benefited at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466506/#Comment_466506" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-23T04:09:12+00:00" title="September 23, 2017  4:09AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 23, 2017 4:09AM by Jeff_Slater.">edited September 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>In a nutshell: if you have a project that could benefit from outside perspectives, I recommend putting it up, explaining where it's going, and perhaps specifying some specific concerns and questions.

For me, it's important to take the structure of normal conversation and then steer that structure into storytelling.<br/><br/>We got introverts - people that rather listens and draw logical assumptions than talk.<br/>We got extroverts - people that tend to cherish the group and talks a lot.<br/>We got ambiverts - people that are flexible and takes the role of introverts and extrovert depending on the number of intro-/extroverts in the group.<br/><br/>See this is a very simple generalization, and even simpler explanation of those.<br/><br/>And we need people to talk, and we shouldn't put a strain on those who talks. Are someone bulldozing over other people? Then we got a problem, but normal conversations are built around one or two people having an idea, taking the initiative to talk and then have other people chime in.<br/><br/>Initiative to talk, and even the option to contribute, shouldn't be distributed evenly, because that's not how conversation works. The one takes the initiative should talk - that's how we get something to talk about in the first place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466547/#Comment_466547" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-25T19:57:38+00:00" title="September 25, 2017  7:57PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 26, 2017 3:26AM by Jeff_Slater.">edited September 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">@Hasimir</a> <br/>"Then things like <b>The Quiet Year</b> (which I love) push the envelope even farther."<br/><br/>Hi Hasimir, <br/><br/>I've had sessions of <b>The Quiet Year</b> that weren't bad and then I've had some that were unsatisfying. I would like to know how you are playing the game, as best as you can describe, to have great sessions. For example, what has the mechanic "Hold a Discussion" added to your game and how do you use it in order to get the most meaningful and best story results? Also, when choosing the "Start a Project" option, how do you use the amount of time to make it most relevant a give the most meaningful and best story results? Do you only have players do solo narrations on their turn or do you ever act out scenes with other players? To what degree do you have players act out individual characters within the community if at all? Basically, what are you doing to produce the great results that you are having?

I was kinda tired so things were quite simple and part of the time I found hard to focus and come up with a good idea for the path the characters were taking. Fortunately I had some idea for the background of the quest and one of the players provided some inspiration by mentioning the Tomb of Annihilation.<br/><br/>The players were happy with the deal that all PCs would be peasants that will die one by one, so if their characters got killed another one stepped upfront to replace them and the adventure continued. We all had fun trying different things though: one was taking all the bad choices and hoping to roll low to get a gruesome death. The other was trying his best to make them survive. I roleplayed the characters sent to death as the most optimistic of them all, then narrated an exaggerated death whenever they rolled low on their intent.<br/><br/>This particular deal of everybody handling the story in a different way got me thinking, though maybe this has been done before anyway: What if all players established their expectations of the story and the conflict resolution mechanic adjudicated narration rights to one of the players depending on the roll? This would give that player the chance to introduce cues that would end up making their expectation true at the end of the game, so things become partially a game of authoring the world in a specific way part of the time and navigating the fiction as a character for the rest of the session.<br/><br/>Which could work better if all players got to introduce details to support their expectations when the scene is framed, or maybe roll to see who starts describing the scene focus and then a second player adds one detail to support a twist for that situation (as I think that having more than two players framing a scene is a recipe for gonzo gameplay)<br/><br/>Ever heard of something along these lines? Its strikes a familiar chord for me but can't pinpoint what, as I'm sure I've not played a game with this mechanic but I may have read about it somewhere.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466582/#Comment_466582" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-26T16:28:07+00:00" title="September 26, 2017  4:28PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It reminds me a little of MonkeyDome/Swords without Master, but those don't assign moods or tone to specific players.<br/><br/>I was working on a couple of designs which did just that a few years back, but I got distracted before I had a chance to have a workable prototype.

Let's see...<br/><br/>Firstly, I am on board with the premise here. I quite like time travel stories, the philosophical themes and high stakes are quite appealing. So in that regard this seems subjectively a worthwhile game to make, and I agree with the chosen scope: a time machine, an iterative time loop, and its end.<br/><br/>Second, have you read <a href="http://www.mjyoung.net/time/" rel="nofollow">M.J. Young's time travel stuff</a>? Your time travel framework is somewhat reminiscent of his, and amusingly your conceit of "players play themselves" is similar to his magnum opus, the wonderfully quirky roleplaying game <i>Multiverser</i>. If you haven't, there's some quite exciting reading for you right there [grin].<br/><br/>Moving on, one thing I dislike in story game design is "design by scripting". It's this thing where the game is constructed in the form of fill-in-the-blanks scenes, instead of formulating it in more game-like ways like stages of play and possible moves. You've got a bit of this going on here, and I'm saying this strictly as a fellow designer with my own weird convictions, but I'm pretty sure that you could make the game more intense and less write-by-numbers for the players by getting away from this habit.<br/><br/>An example of what I mean is the way you conceptualize the initial scene with the time machine: you lay out some quite strict parameters for what the scene is like, and then ask the players to "play it out", despite the fact that you have already determined every important event that will occur in the scene, and those you have not (e.g. who will be transported by the machine) are actually actively randomized. This approach reduces the players into mad-libs (or exquisite corpse, rather, in this case) contributors: they get to say what the time machine looks like, but they don't get a say in what happens with it. To me the role of merely enacting the game designer's script is too petty to offer to players.<br/><br/>Were I making a game on the same premise, I would probably establish one of the players as a lightweight GM-like figure whose character is the creator of the time machine; this player would have the task of chairmanning play and framing action forward in the "present time", until the moment the time machine is activated. I would allow derring-do of whatever sort this player envisions related to the machine, too - the frame story in the present could well have some minor complications of its own. And I would allow the players to determine naturally who travels in time and where, through play, as constructively coordinated by the inventor-player. I feel that this kind of looser framing allows players to engage the play more passionately as compared to being essentially handed a script. More of a sandbox you get to play in than a play you get to act in, that's my ideal for game design.<br/><br/>As the game text moves on, it continues providing game design predominantly in the form of plot arc design - the game tells you which scenes to play in what order, and you get to fill in the blanks. I know that this is a relatively popular approach in the freeform circles (presumably because it lowers the skill threshold), but it leaves me grasping for something to care about in a game, apparently because I don't care about filling in blanks.<br/><br/>But that's that - we can talk about the philosophy inherent in jeepform design (which this kind of freeform storygame greatly resembles) in depth later if you want, I'll stop harping about that one point for now. We have other things to address here:<br/><br/>One concern that I have with this game is that it approaches its subject in a pretty lightweight manner. This may be frustrating to players who are familiar with the conceit of time travel and like the intellectual element of plotting out time-lines and determining the consequences of various actions. The game actively mitigates against story elements that many players (myself probably included) would like and expect in a time travel game: there are no real ways to wrestle with the paradoxical nature of time travel, there is no rigour to the cosmological rules that apply to the exercise, and there's no thriller plot regarding whether or not time or the people involved survive their mad game with the powers of the gods. It is of course fine to be what you want to be, but I personally like <i>Time and Temp</i> much more, specifically because it is so much more hands-on about the subject matter. It is somewhat counter-intuitive for a game to pave over such central parts of what makes a literary genre - it's a bit like if one were making a western game and ensured carefully that there would be no gunplay whatsoever in the game.<br/><br/>Beyond the above points, the game seems to me to be a well-formed specimen of its type - this is what freeform style games are like, for good or ill. I would consider this to be quite ready for playtest and eventual productization, assuming that it is generally in the creative place that the designer wants it to be. If there are any technical foibles left, they are of the sort that are better addressed by playtest than studio review. While I have my misgivings, as documented above, they are of such higher order that it doesn't really make any sense to attempt to address them in design - this simply isn't the time travel game I'd like to have [grin].                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davey" title="davey"><img alt="davey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/739/n2UJ50N52BV5N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davey">davey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466659/#Comment_466659" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-29T14:04:15+00:00" title="September 29, 2017  2:04PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 29, 2017 2:06PM by davey.">edited September 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeff, these Authority distribution categories do provide a nice framework in which to think about these things.  How about a turn-based category in which authority shifts around the table. Games that come to mind here include "final girl", "microscope", and others. This approach also has gradations I think. For instance lots of games use a rotating scene framing authority: "fiasco", "downfall", "follow" that is weaker than trad gm control in that once the scene commences, we play to find out in a very collaborative way. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM" title="Mongrel_GM"><img alt="Mongrel_GM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM">Mongrel_GM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466660/#Comment_466660" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-29T14:11:53+00:00" title="September 29, 2017  2:11PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 29, 2017 4:15PM by Mongrel_GM.">edited September 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/davey" rel="nofollow">davey</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>I believe I've linked the file for one of my recent efforts "The Palimpsest Device" which is a very boutique attempt to explore characters in a recursive Groundhog Day format.

Sounds like you are working out some new techniques to address the stuff we are talking about here. <br/><br/>2). I wonder about your hidden info ideas. I have a game idea that  provides an approach to this challenge, but is very specific to the context of the particular game I imagined it for. Here's the basic idea:  the game is one in which players alternate as playing criminals, petty or otherwise, who have been brought in for questioning re a crime. The other players play investigators (either behind the glass or in the room. The criminal has a certain framework to work in. This consists of some structure the game will impose plus the background of what has been established so far.  The interogee has already written her piece of info on a card. The investigators question her until they are ready to make their guesses (I'm leaving a lot out and parts are still not fully formed in my brain even...). They make their cases. The suspect puts the clue card in a face down stack if some but not all investigators guess correctly. They don't add it if all or none of the investigators have gottten that part of the case figured out. Once an investigator thinks they have all the elements to the solution of the crime mystery figured out. They call to solve the case and monologue their analysis.  Then they check the stack of cards.  It's adapting the basic mechanism of the party card game "Dixit".  Clues have to occupy that Goldilocks zone of not too easy and not too hard...  I also had a dexterity mechanism in there whereby players build a house of cards as they go. Like reverse dread but w cards instead of Jenga. But not sure if that idea fits anymore. AnywAy, does my basic idea make sense to you?  Should create a mystery in which everyone creates part of it, but no one knows all of it...  <br/><br/>And 3). I agree that the gmLess approach to rpg's or storygames is an area with tons of potential (read: unsolved problems).  I'm in love with the creTive challenges and just wish I had more time and opportunity to actually play games!  About 1x/month is all I seem to manage.  I clearly need to play more, because it's super fun and rewarding usually, and because I won't be likely to make fun games if I don't play fun games!<br/><br/>Fiat lux,<br/>Davey<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466702/#Comment_466702" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-30T07:29:00+00:00" title="September 30, 2017  7:29AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" rel="nofollow">Jeff_Slater</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>One that folks have yet to mention is <i>how to deal with information that is supposed to be keep secret from the players</i>.</p></div></blockquote>\nThere been talk about this on the Swedish game theory forum, and the consensus is that you shouldn't have any secrets <i>between the players</i>.

Put it up in its own thread and let people take a look at it <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> <br/><br/></div></blockquote>\nEero:  you are a phenomenal writer!  Thanks for the clear and intelligent construction of your thoughts. A real pleasure to read. <br/>My experience of our playtest group at storygames Seattle has not been so dire as your cautionary secret-santa scenario suggests. This aspect of the group has gone on hiatus recently, but for probably a couple years running (and maybe more... that's just when I first showed up), there has been a twice monthly Meetup in which a core of somewhat connected people with shared interests in gmLess storygame design, and a sprinkling of curious gamers from the Seattle area worked pretty effectively (I felt) at having fun together and trying out each others games. The " in real life " aspect of this community, along with the fortuitous confluence of a few like minded members who seemed to successfully shepherd the endeavor, was almost certainly the key to our success.  The quality of feedback was sometimes very high and collegial I think. Other times not so much. But even then, seeing how the game went, what people made of it, was always of value. <br/><br/>I tend to agree with you that online playtesting is not a social trickier conducive to success and I also think (alongside you) that reading each others efforts and giving feedback (once one finds a relationship with a certain simpatico) would be the best way forward for online support of each others creative efforts. <br/><br/>FYI:  I never got to bring any of my game ideas to the table. I could have, but I kept holding back. By the time I was getting ready, other people seemed to lose interest and the group stopped meeting. I think the out of phase creative cycle phenomenon you referenced caught me by surprise. But I'm hopeful we get the band back together some time soonish. <br/><br/>Davey                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466711/#Comment_466711" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-30T14:46:09+00:00" title="September 30, 2017  2:46PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I can totally get behind the idea of doing a running playtest and development workshop in real life. I've done that myself (in 2013-15 in Helsinki was the last time), and it can work very well when you work week to week to build an intelligent development team that can take various kinds of games and execute successful playtest sessions.<br/><br/>In my experience the clever thing to do is to build up a playtest team and then collect projects for them to chew through, rather than try to find a lot of designers who need playtesting; game development is labor intensive, you'll benefit by not trying to take too many games on board at once. When we did this in Helsinki only about 50% of the games we dealt with were created by locals who actually participated in the proceedings; much of the time was spent doing in-depth playtest and development feedback for other people who just happened to have worthwhile games under development. I think that we did some really great work then, and it was largely thanks to success in building up a core team that was interested in game development and willing to playtest other people's stuff.<br/><br/>Thinking of reciprocality, in our case it was much more complex than "I'll playtest your game if you'll playtest mine". Many of the best members of the team aren't very much into game design themselves, for instance. Often the big payoffs for participants in our playtest ring came in the form of social capital (friends, contacts, respect), play experience with often highly experimental state-of-the-art projects, and actual experience in game development, which all they could then leverage to improve their hobby life in various ways. I've moved out of town since then, and the playtest ring has been somewhat quiet lately, but we're still constantly reaping the fruits of the labour done then: people found new friends, games developed then are being published now, and several people found new directions for their own hobby life out of the project.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davey" title="davey"><img alt="davey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/739/n2UJ50N52BV5N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davey">davey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466712/#Comment_466712" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-30T15:11:49+00:00" title="September 30, 2017  3:11PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looks like my HTML is off somehow and my blockquote isn't in a block, so I'll just say:  the below quote is from Eero and is inserted just to establish context for my responses to his much longer comment. Thanks again Eero \n<blockquote>Beyond the above points, the game seems to me to be a well-formed specimen of its type - this is what freeform style games are like, for good or ill. I would consider this to be quite ready for playtest and eventual productization, assuming that it is generally in the creative place that the designer wants it to be. If there are any technical foibles left, they are of the sort that are better addressed by playtest than studio review. While I have my misgivings, as documented above, they are of such higher order that it doesn't really make any sense to attempt to address them in design - this simply isn't the time travel game I'd like to have [grin].</blockquote>\nThanks so much for your thoughtful feedback. Thanks for the reading suggestion too. My list of what I want to read always grows faster than my reading rate can accommodate, but I'm putting your suggestion on the list. I'm currently reading John Crowley " aegypt cycle" which is apprapo of nothing but I do like to reciprocate and I'm loving his writing. <br/><br/>I will reread your input several more times I'm sure. It's good stuff. <br/>You are right that the story is very constrained to the point of not really being a story even.  It is also intended to be a lighthearted exploration of identity and character and not really a launching point for elaboration of the fascinating tautological and reality bending implications of time travel's philosophical implications. At least lighthearted is what I was steering for. It's quirky for sure, but was simple and constrained enough that I felt it a safer first offer than some of my other ideas.   <br/><br/>I'll be thinking for sure about your observation that it is too constrained and mad-Libby.  I'm sure there are other points you made that I'll catch on to when rereading your input. <br/><br/>And hey, I forgot all about time&amp;temp. I have a copy of that but never got around to reading it carefully. I think I skimmed it when I bought it. I'll be looking at that too!   <br/><br/>I struck upon the basic idea when trying to do something like a game I playtested with a guy here in Seattle. His game was better I think!  It involved iterative reenactments of a scene with differing versions of your character. But his conceit was that all the characters were reminiscing about a past they had shared but each character remembers it differently and from their particular perspective and cording to the biases we had established for each player. So you would play your character through the lens of other characters. Did I explain that in a way that conveys the sense of it?  I hope so. <br/><br/>I felt he had the absolute coolest idea. It was great fun. But I didn't like some of the things he was commmitted to in the game (and which spoiled the fun of the central conceit, I thought) so I tried to come up with another way of building that kind of a structure into a game. This is the best I could come up with, and I hope it will someday provide some people with some edifying and amusing hours together, but yea, I don't think it's as elegant and perfect an idea as the mechanic I Misappropriated from the game that inspired it!    I never found out what the guy did with his game after the one playtest I participated in. <br/><br/>Thanks again, and I will go on a real computer later today to change the sharing settings on the document. sorry about that!  <br/><br/>Davey.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davey" title="davey"><img alt="davey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/739/n2UJ50N52BV5N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davey">davey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466713/#Comment_466713" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-30T15:13:02+00:00" title="September 30, 2017  3:13PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well turns out the quote was in a block but just doesn't appear that way in preview mode...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466714/#Comment_466714" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-30T15:29:15+00:00" title="September 30, 2017  3:29PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2017 3:30PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited September 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The reason why preview doesn't "get" your quote block is that it lacks a few attributes. HTML tags can each have their own "settings" established within them. If you'll create a quotation block with the Quote link in a thread you'll see what the default blockquote tag that this forum software likes looks like:<br/><br/><b>&lt;blockquote class="Quote" rel="davey"&gt;</b><br/><br/>As you can see, there are two attributes in addition to the name of the tag in there. In comparison, your quote block just has the tag name in there:<br/><br/><b>&lt;blockquote&gt;</b><br/><br/>What a given website does with HTML is totally contextual, the web designer can make HTML code jump through hoops. In the case of the Vanilla forum software the setup is as we've seen here: if your blockquote tag does not have any settings on it, the preview mode apparently doesn't display it correctly, but the actual thread view does. It would be fair to say that it's a minor bug.<br/><br/>To fix the preview (if you cared to - not like it matters for actual thread view) you'd need to add the "class" attribute to the tag, it seems like. Like so:<br/><br/><b>&lt;blockquote class="Quote"&gt;</b><br/><br/>The attribute name is "class" as you can see, and it has a set value, which is "Quote". Apparently the style code for the Vanilla forum software looks at the class value of the blockquote tag to determine whether to treat a given blockquote as a quotation, at least in its preview window. Sort of unnecessary in that all blockquotes are generally quotations in this context, but I assume it's been done this way for future compatibility - there could be some Vanilla add-ons or something that used that same tag "blockquote" for something totally different.<br/><br/>As you can see from my first bolded example, there's a second attribute in there as well, named "rel". That's short for "relation", a traditional name in HTML writing for various associations. In this case Vanilla uses "rel" to express attribution for the quote. As you can see, your quote block doesn't have that little caption on top telling us who wrote the text you quoted - that's because there wasn't a "rel" attribute in your blockquote, so the software had nothing to put there.<br/><br/>You can put anything you want in the "rel" attribute to change who the box attributes itself to. For example, when I'm quoting from Bram Stoker, I just write him into the "rel" attribute to make his name appear at the top of the quotation box:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Bram Stoker in his novel Dracula" rel="nofollow">Bram Stoker in his novel Dracula</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Strange that it never struck me that the very next house might be the Count\u2019s hiding-place! Goodness knows that we had enough clues from the conduct of the patient Renfield! The bundle of letters relating to the purchase of the house were with the typescript. Oh, if we had only had them earlier we might have saved poor Lucy! Stop; that way madness lies! Harker has gone back, and is again collating his material. He says that by dinner-time they will be able to show a whole connected narrative. He thinks that in the meantime I should see Renfield, as hitherto he has been a sort of index to the coming and going of the Count. I hardly see this yet, but when I get at the dates I suppose I shall. What a good thing that Mrs. Harker put my cylinders into type! We never could have found the dates otherwise....</p></div></blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davey" title="davey"><img alt="davey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/739/n2UJ50N52BV5N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davey">davey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466715/#Comment_466715" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-30T16:05:48+00:00" title="September 30, 2017  4:05PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Warrior monk:  <br/>Re- your idea that took form during some dnd goofing around.  Sounds fun. I don't know of any thing that does what you describe. I can't quite figure how the various drives and narrative control would work together to steer the story toward each characters predefined arc. I ant to hear more about that. Specifically, more specifics when you get there...  I like the idea (if I understood it correctly) but wonder how it can work. For instance, what happens when the characters directions necessitate for mutually exclusive situations. Maybe they can work them out in separate scenarios?  That might even be satisfying if you can then link the scenarios in some meta structure  I've seen this in some movies, but I can't dredge up which at the moment. New York Stories???  I think those vignettes never intertwine actually.  <br/>Anyway, that's probably a different direction than you wanted to head in. <br/><br/>So although I can't think of anything that does what I was addressing above, "final girl" does involve lots of characters that get played and killed. I've had real fun with that game.   Also "downfall"  (if I'm remembering correctly) involves a world creation phase that resembles your scenesetting idea in which a second player adds a twist or complication.  That's probably a pretty common thing since it's pretty easy to lift the basic idea of complications from pbta games. <br/><br/>Not sure if anything here will be helpful to you. Keep pursuing your idea though.

I don't mean evenly in the terms and sense you outline above. I mean that everyone can participate creativity in the story telling\u2014in a collaborative manner\u2014during the appropriate time, given the rules, and their role during that particular time in the game. That doesn't mean everyone has to contribute the same way, or at the same time, or that the rules and mechanics seek that aim, or that the concerns you outlined above are not taken into consideration. I'm talking about games like <b>Fiasco, Microscope, Follow, Fall of Magic, The Quite  Year</b>, and so on. So, in short, I'm not speaking to the issues you've raised, which are all important, but extremely complex and dependent on the given context.<br/><br/>As far as there being no need for secrets being kept from players in a collaborative story game, I think it is completely dependent upon the game's design and aims. I don't think there is a monolithic truth about what should be done or not be done. I do think that there are good arguments for sharing information among players and agree that <i>typically</i> information should be shared by players\u2014for example, Ben Robbins has made a good case for this\u2014but I don't think that this is a truism that applies to every collaborative Story Game. My personal belief is that there are way too many assumptions in the collaborative Story Game form, and GMless form in general, that haven't been examined or challenged enough. Anyway, my 2 cents. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Black_Vulmea" title="Black_Vulmea"><img alt="Black_Vulmea" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/119/nGG4BQE0LR8F5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Black_Vulmea">Black_Vulmea</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466756/#Comment_466756" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-02T18:55:15+00:00" title="October  2, 2017  6:55PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Rickard" rel="nofollow">Rickard</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>There can, however, be situations where there is a secret that no participant knows the answer too . . . </p></div></blockquote>\nRandom content generators are good for this, particularly when they are used to establish facts of the setting previously unknown to both the referee and the players.<br/><br/>Frex, there was a blog post years ago in which the blogger described telling a youthful <i>D&amp;D</i> player that his paladin could only find a <i>holy avenger</i> magic sword - which gives paladins all sorts of bonuses to their abilities - if the referee generated it using the random treasure tables for monsters. That's one example of using a random content generator.<br/><br/>But the blogger's response disappointed me: the player wasn't asking the referee to <b>give</b> his player a magic sword, rather, he wanted to engage in a quest to <b>find and win</b> the <i>holy avenger</i>. Engaged, proactive players like this are worth their weight in drachmas, and to me the referee's response was like a giant boot on the throat of this kid's aspirations for his character.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the referee here erred significantly by relying on a single source of random generation to define the facts of the world, namely the treasure table. He would've been better served using something like the rules for sages: sages have a percentage chance to know the answer to questions posed by the player characters - I've used this many times to establish facts about a setting for which I didn't have a prepared answer, and I've ported this rule over into many other games for the same reason.<br/><br/>The result would be a quest that builds itself: find the sage, then use random content generators like terrain, monsters, <i>&amp;c</i> to create the sage's answer as to the location of the sword and the challenges in locating it.<br/><br/>The <i>Mythic Game Master Emulator</i> approach is well know to posters here, I gather, and can work in a gm-less or otherwise collaborative setting to establish facts. Another approach might use something like <a href="http://black-vulmea.blogspot.com/2012/12/random-encounters-rorys-story-cubes.html" rel="nofollow">Rory's Story Cubes</a> or <a href="http://black-vulmea.blogspot.com/2012/12/random-encounters-in-real-time-verbal.html" rel="nofollow">'Verbal Kint-ing'</a> new content to build a mystery so that everyone can experience first-hand discovery in actual play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466784/#Comment_466784" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-04T19:25:40+00:00" title="October  4, 2017  7:25PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/davey" rel="nofollow">davey</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Warrior monk:  <br/>Re- your idea that took form during some dnd goofing around.  Sounds fun. I don't know of any thing that does what you describe. I can't quite figure how the various drives and narrative control would work together to steer the story toward each characters predefined arc. I ant to hear more about that. Specifically, more specifics when you get there...  I like the idea (if I understood it correctly) but wonder how it can work. For instance, what happens when the characters directions necessitate for mutually exclusive situations. Maybe they can work them out in separate scenarios?  <br/></p></div></blockquote>\nThis particular has been done before in other RPGs, though I think it's most used as part of the core in jrpgs like Tenra Bansho, Double Cross and Shinobigami. Basically, you do as it's been advised above somewhere: make sure PCs have clear objectives and strong drives. You can even apply PvP here if those objectives are either opposite or common but can only be achieved by a single person. <br/><br/>Then you ask one player where does she want to go and framing the new scene from that point; after that, you ask whose characters can and want to be there too. If there are players whose characters can't or won't need to be on the scene, those players can take charge of NPCs. You just give them an objective for the scene, maybe some motivation and resources (what can the NPC do to achieve their objectives?) and play to find out what happens. <br/><br/>Once the scene is over you continue with the next player, letting her specify the basics of the scene goal and ask the other players if their characters either can or want to be there, and so on. Jrpgs tend to have one act for introducing the characters and/or a few of these scenes where two or more PCs meet and interact/fight a bit, to end up with a scene where all the PCs are reunited for the final clash.<br/><br/>Gotta check those titles you mentioned, I think I heard a bit about final girl before, and brainstorming the setting creation isn't of course nothing new, I took the idea from Burning Wheel but there's been other titles with this mechanic too. Thanks for the ideas, everything helps!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467444/#Comment_467444" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-04T08:20:30+00:00" title="November  4, 2017  8:20AM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" rel="nofollow">Jeff_Slater</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Rickard, I think you read a lot into my statement that wasn't intended.

However, it depends on what you define as secrets. Personal thoughts, like "I don't like this player", should be kept secret. :P Participants goals and ideas about the game should come up, and any participant shouldn't decide when a secret should come into play. If a collaborative game should have secrets, the game itself should control that. For example, writing world changing events on pieces of papers and then turn them over at any time during play to tilt the world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467456/#Comment_467456" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-04T14:42:18+00:00" title="November  4, 2017  2:42PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 4, 2017 2:44PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited November 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Rickard" rel="nofollow">Rickard</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Participants goals and ideas about the game should come up, and any participant shouldn't decide when a secret should come into play.
