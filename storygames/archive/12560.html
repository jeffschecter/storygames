For lack of a better term I am referring to is as "Isometric Resolution.' Unlike traditional RPGs, where the GM would completely stat out an opponent, the players are actually rolling against themselves. In the case of Danger Patrol and InSpectres, the only stat the opponent has is how many hits you need to do to make the opponent go away, In the case of Apocolypse World, the only stat is how much damage the opponent does if you fail your roll.<br/><br/> I'm finding this to be an intreguing mechanic because it allows conflicts to be almost self-balancing. In the case of Danger Patrol, every die not rolled succesfully becomes a minus. The greater the amount of detail that the GM and players give to a situation, the more likely it will turn out spectacularly or badly.<br/><br/>Can anyone think of other games that use an isometric mechanic? Does something like this feel natural to you, or do you feel like you are boxing at shadows instead of an actual opponent in these types of games?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nameless" title="Nameless"><img alt="Nameless" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nameless">Nameless</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281992/#Comment_281992" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-20T20:38:13+00:00" title="July 20, 2010  8:38PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Otherkind is my favorite for mechanics like these.

When I first noticed this mechanic in InSpectres, I referred to it as "Shadow Boxing." Basically because the players aren't actually up against an opponent that the GM has dreamed up and statted out. They are actually playing against the system itself. The GM is only there to provide color for the adventure. What you have proposed is very similar. It frees up the GM from having to do a balancing act when it comes to the mechanics.<br/><br/>I used the term Isometric since it sounds cooler and it is more accurate. Isometric excercise is where the person pits his own muscles against themselves in order to gain greater muscle tone. In the case of game mechanics, the player is pitting the game system against itself. The system is both aid and opponent. Characteristics of Isometric mechanics would include:<br/><br/>1.) The player is rolling against himself. However, the GM may be able to apply some form of modifier to apply to the situation to make it more dangerous or dramatic, but it is the player's roll that determines the outcome. Bad rolls gain the character some form of harm or setback.<br/><br/>2.) The more powerful the characters grow in the system, the more powerful the system automatically becomes to resist the players.<br/><br/>If anyone can define this better, I'd love to see it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282364/#Comment_282364" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-22T08:38:04+00:00" title="July 22, 2010  8:38AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 22, 2010 8:38AM by DanielSolis.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heck, that definition works well for me.

As their is a semi-adversarial component to the game, choosing to succeed weakens you for later challenges while at the same time strengthening another player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/HiQKid" title="HiQKid"><img alt="HiQKid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/HiQKid">HiQKid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282480/#Comment_282480" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-22T12:35:40+00:00" title="July 22, 2010 12:35PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Poison'd, players roll against their own stats, as I recall.<br>My game City of Refuge, being descended from Otherkind, has a lot of IR-ness.

I would need details on how it works, because if the harm inflicted is determined by the GM, that part would not be isometric unless the system itself somehow determined the minimum/maximum limits of the damage. In Danger Patrol, the harm is determined by the system, but the GM describes what form that harm takes. I that would be isometric. On the other side of the spectrum, Apocolypse World whether you take harm is determined by your own die roll, but the amount of damage is semi-arbitrarily determined by the GM.<br><br>Is what you have described desireable? Good question.

What he spends ends up in the players hands for their own use, which ends up back in the GMs possession to create more challenges.
