(The short side is like, 54 cm, haven't been able to measure the long side yet.) I'm using al-Qadim but it's my understanding that some other lines had similar. They seem brittle AF but so far they're all in tact. Are they suppposed to go on the wall? Or in the middle of the table?<br/>I've recieved suggestions that I should laminate them; I'm also thinking of having a copy shop make 1:1 copies on some sorta cloth, I dunno (I saw on BGG many years ago a photo of people playing an 18XX train game on a cloth copy of the map).<br/><br/>Are they supposed to be public knowledge? They don't fit behind the screen.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462035/#Comment_462035" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-17T08:40:07+00:00" title="April 17, 2017  8:40AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've thought them to be basically eye candy with no particular intended play use, emblematic of the erosion in actual play practices through this era.

Personally I liked these maps provided the books also came with images of the maps in the core books (which many did). The good thing about them were they were both evocative and handy while prepping for the game. I used to pin them to my wall and found it quite easy to become familiar with the lay of the land by having the map by my desk when I would play. During play I would either use the map folded, rely on the images of the map in the book, or photocopy sections of the map and put them in my folder. These maps were also useful if you assumed the characters had knowledge of the geography, posted it near the gaming table and used it as a common point of reference. <br/><br/>A lot of them didn't have hexes, and that was I think one of the bigger issues (because you had to use a ruler or similar method to measure distance). Still you could eyeball or measure manually. The Core Map for Ravenloft came with a pretty cool plastic overlay that had hexes on it which 2097 mentioned. One advantage of going without hexes is the map is a little clearer to the eye and is freed up to be more evocative. Personally I like hex maps. But I do see what they were trying to do. Ravenloft even shifted at one point to a quasi 3D map of the core (which I think was good for being evocative but not as good for precision). <br/><br/>I don't think this was so much about not worrying about live play. I think it was about a general shift away from exploration as the focus and also just a product of experimenting with different approaches. Sometimes these maps landed with a thud, but other times these maps could be awesome. <br/><br/>If you check out the module Feast of Goblyns, there are a ton of 3D maps in there of all different kinds and I've always found those very evocative and functional at the table. They gave me a very clear idea in my head of what the places were supposed to look like.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462056/#Comment_462056" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-17T18:56:04+00:00" title="April 17, 2017  6:56PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, it seems that many of these aQ books don't have the maps in the book.

Like, it was fun to look at and sometimes point at and say "Here's where you're going" but I can't remember counting out distances on it or anything.  But it was cool, so we made a full sized color copy of it.  Because folding it down to box-size put a lot of stress on the paper.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
