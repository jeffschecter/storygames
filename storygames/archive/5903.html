We won't be including rooms in the cost of registration this year. You can get rooms at the Watertown Hotel or other venues within walking distance. There's an <a href="http://goplaynw.wetpaint.com/page/Accommodations" rel="nofollow">accommodations page</a> on the wiki where you can get more information.<br/><br/>However, we don't want anyone to miss out on GPNW because they couldn't afford hotel space. This thread is for people who may not be able to afford a hotel stay, but still want to come down for GPNW. Post in this thread if you're looking for a space to crash for the convention, or if you've got room to spare for people to crash in. <br/><br/>To make it easier, enter "Space Available" or "Need Space" at the top of your post.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143086/#Comment_143086" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T11:56:24+00:00" title="May  8, 2008 11:56AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry to perform thread necromancy, but I just tried to make a reservation at the University Inn and was told that the special rates were unavailable since the room block had been cancelled.  I can only assume this is due to the block not selling through?  Unfortunate.<br/><br/>Anyway, that means I'm looking to split a studio room at the Watertown with someone for just Saturday night (the 31st).  This could fall under either "Space Available" or "Need Space," as I'm willing to make a reservation if someone else is in the same boat, or pay half if somebody's has already got one.  <a href="mailto:xorph@xorph.com" rel="nofollow">Hit me up!</a>  I don't snore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143752/#Comment_143752" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-13T12:57:27+00:00" title="May 13, 2008 12:57PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brendan,<br/>I'm working on arranging the Vancouver Crew's sleeping arrangements right now, and there may be spare room in our rooms. Are you averse to sleeping on a couch if it comes down to that?<br/><br/>Can you email me in a few days if I don't follow up on this?
