Make up a PC class, have her + a bunch of MM monsters be my army, then go at it against someone else's army. This sounds like a lot of fun. The rules are clearly very good for this sort of play, and I like the idea that my characters can die and then come back next game. This would seem to make pull-no-punches combat front and center. I don't like (in the context of 4e) having to clear out a bunch of mooks that I know I can kill with ease. I want a <i>challenge</i>, and the 4e combat system seems to provide this for me. Also, skills can play into this: one could list all the skills and how they would interact with certain terrain or combat situations to grant bonuses in combat.<br/><br/>In short: cut out the roleplay shit and use 4e as a minis/counters/scribbles-on-graph-paper wargaming system. I know there's already a D&amp;D minis game, but I don't care 'bout that, and I'm not sure the status of that right now, anyway.<br/><br/>Anyone tried this? Does this sound like fun to anyone?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>*I haven't had a chance to play the skill challenge system, and while I acknowledge it as very cool, I don't really care about it for my purposes here.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212847/#Comment_212847" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-17T07:01:38+00:00" title="June 17, 2009  7:01AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>It sounds like you're not roleplaying about anything interesting.

They're built to fight PCs.  If you have monsters fight other monsters, they don't really function as designed.  Some will be wildly more useful, some will be wildly less useful.  <br/><br/>Two examples of fights where monsters used inappropriately didn't work right:<br/><br/>A) In our 4e Spelljammer game, we acquired three Umber Hulks as crew members on our ship.  Umber Hulks are elite monsters two levels or so above the actual PCs.  We then had a big githyanki space pirate fight*, which was supposed to be balanced XP wise with the Umber Hulks as allies.<br/><br/>It was possibly the worst 4e combat experience I've had.  Not bad for the PCs at all, since we never were in noticeable danger.  But three umber hulks pumping out area of effect daze and push as a minor action meant the githyanki basically never could accomplish anything.  Meanwhile, the githyanki's defenses were a little bit too difficult for the PCs to hit, so we couldn't do much damage to them.  so the fight dragged on and on.<br/><br/>Now, the Umber Hulk's gaze ability works fine as a monster ability on an elite versus PCs: area of effect Daze reduces the PC pool of action, meaning the Umber Hulk isn't at a disadvantage for the economy of actions.  But Umber Hulk as allies to the PCs create unfun fights.<br/><br/><br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/4alum/2009May" rel="nofollow">The Orcus versus Demogorgon fight</a> which they even mention is not how the rules are intended to work.  Orcus wins the fight with a single lucky attack.  Now, fighting against a group of epic level PCs (Orcus's intended opponents), the instant death attack is fine: they probably have a half dozen ways of rising from the dead before the end of the encounter, and at worst have to wait out the fight until the party Cleric can do the Raise Dead ritual.  And even if the PC stays dead the whole fight, there are still three to five other PCs on the battlefield fighting Orcus, so the PC side isn't out as much.  But against another Solo monster, Orcus's instant death attack is much stronger, and way swingier in how it affects the battle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bottom line: the designers and developers made these guys to fight Player Characters, put up a good fight, but ultimately lose.  And they do this job pretty well.  But the monsters weren't designed with fighting other monsters in mind, so they'll be a lot more haphazard in terms of effectiveness and fun factor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>*I was very pleased to see how the Githyanki racial encounter power makes them perfect space pirates.  But that's a different thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213005/#Comment_213005" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-17T14:46:37+00:00" title="June 17, 2009  2:46PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hexabolic</cite>I'd signed up for Game Day at my FLGS to check out 4e but had to cancel for reasons of pressing project deadlines.  </blockquote>\nIf you're looking for story and roleplaying, then you chose the absolute worst place to find it.

As Ralph says, the thrust of the book is about the powerz, which are almost exclusively combat-focused.  I'm not saying it's impossible to pull a meaty RP experience out of 4e, just that I'd find it an extraordinary challenge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213021/#Comment_213021" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-17T16:01:24+00:00" title="June 17, 2009  4:01PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh, it tells everything one needs to know about the term "story game" that 4th edition D&amp;D could be considered one.

There are lots of Magic: the Gathering cards out there that are simply not very good. There are others that look bad but are good. Some are incredible in the right situation but terrible on average. Understanding what's what and how to use it is part of the challenge. I see the same thing at work here: if you're playing a guy who likes to field Orcus alone, load up your army with a large number of offensively powerful but fragile units, and exploit the fact that Orcus's best trick targets only one guy and more or less ignores normal defenses. If Demogorgon turns out to be a <a href="http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr11b" rel="nofollow">Timmy creature</a>, that's fine, learn and adapt. If Umber Hulks are amazing, then use them or build an army that counters them.<br/><br/>The game might be degenerate, with only one or two dominant and practical setups, but I think it would at least take you a long time to figure it out and prove it in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213125/#Comment_213125" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-18T10:00:47+00:00" title="June 18, 2009 10:00AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd just play MageKnight.

I went through a brief period when I was buying D&amp;D plastic minis because Cool Little Guys are cool, and I thought we might even play the wargame version of D&amp;D instead.

If you are like me and enjoy the collecting, but not the high price tag, it is a nice game to be into. At Origins I probably will end up with another 100 figures and some speciality pieces for $20-$30 bucks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213174/#Comment_213174" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-18T11:28:07+00:00" title="June 18, 2009 11:28AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2009 11:31AM by Bret_Gillan.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: BWA</cite>A "customizable" mini game would be awesome.
