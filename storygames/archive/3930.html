What I'm very curious about however, and which is hard to predict based on rules and snippets, is how it works out in "long-term" play. (By which I mean playing the whole thing through with full vision quest implementation, as opposed to skipping ahead to finish in one session.)<br/><br/>I don't mean this as a doubt-casting, so much as simple curiousity as to how it changes the game and what the effects are, as well as, how long does it actually last/take?<br/><br/>Any experiences? (And/or full-run APs that I've overlooked.)<br/><br/>(And btw, is this the proper category for the thread?)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88258/#Comment_88258" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-15T21:02:29+00:00" title="August 15, 2007  9:02PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me confess to never having run a multiple-session Ganakagok game. In my head, the vision-quest rules are designed to be self-pacing: to the extent that players worry about finding out what the dawn will bring, the dawn draws that much nearer. It may prove that the the big pots of medicine that comes with each stage change between night and twilight, twilight and dawn, and dawn and morning may prove too unbalanced, as we found in convention play. On the other hand, that medicine award may work better in extended play, since there will be more turns for Good and Bad Medicine to accumulate by other means--in which case the stage change award can help keep the outcome in doubt. In any event, keep an eye on this in play.<br/><br/>The other recommendation I'll make is to remember to use the stages of the game to keep the situation dynamic: during the Night stage, we get to meet the characters and set them in motion, pursuing the implications of their truth-visions and slowly learning the shape and extent of the "problem" associated with the coming of the Sun. During twilight, some initial answers have been obtained, and efforts to remedy the problem commence. During dawn, things come to fruition or failure, and climactic final efforts are made. In a "competitive" game, this may turn out to be a "suddent death" (or sudden sunrise, anyway) situation. And then in the morning, players narrate the final fates of the world, the people, and their characters as usual. So use moments of "stage change" to introduce new elements of the situation that will continue to drive the action forward from the consequences of the characters' decisions in the previous stage.<br/><br/>In any event, I can't imagine a game of Ganakagok lasting more than two or three sessions; what's compelling about the short-form game is that it does force the group to create a more-or-less complete cosmogonic myth in the space of a few hours. Which is quite cool. <br/><br/>Let me know what happens in play!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88301/#Comment_88301" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-16T05:39:23+00:00" title="August 16, 2007  5:39AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for listening to the podcast!  I haven't played multi-sessions of a single Ganakagok game either, so you'd be the first that I know of if you do it.  I've been curious about the impact of an extended game as well, particularly with the effect doing so would have on using the Vision Quest pools.  In the rules, stage change is not supposed to occur until the vision quest pool is filled.  Whichever player, including the GM, who contributes the last bit of medicine to the pool that fills it gets a good or bad medicine reward--good for the players, bad for the GM--to distribute.  So there is good incentive for the players and the GM to want to contribute to the vision quest pool if it's in use.  But if the vision quest pool is not going to be used to determine stage change, as we've been doing in convention play, then there is no reason to allocate medicine to it.  In play, this has meant that any good and bad medicine generated from conflicts is more likely to be distributed to the people or to the characters (since there is no need to put medicine in the vision quest pool).  Theoretically this may balance out, since both the PCs and the GM would be contributing to the vision quest pool if it made sense to do so.  But I wonder.  I could easily see some games where at least some of the PCs don't contribute to the vision quest pool at all--they have no interest in seeing the sun come (and the game end) until their good medicine amount is more than bad medicine.  At least, they won't contribute to the vision quest pool until others have done so, in the hopes that they will be the one to fill the pool and get the good medicine reward.  I'm interested to see how it turns out for you!<br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thark" title="thark"><img alt="thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i99ronhe.island.liu.se/avatars/eyebrow32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thark">thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88323/#Comment_88323" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-16T07:12:20+00:00" title="August 16, 2007  7:12AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, that was pretty much the answer I was afraid of. :-)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mel White</cite>Thanks for listening to the podcast!</blockquote>\nThanks for making me want to play the game. You bastid'.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill White</cite>In any event, I can't imagine a game of Ganakagok lasting more than two or three sessions;</blockquote>\nI imagine something like a three-four session game, thus "long-term" in quotation marks. I would probably run with the Inexorable Dawn option, and perhaps a shorter Night limit (sum of two highest cards sounds like a lot), but we'll see what happens. (As Mel says, I suspect players would be reluctant to contribute to the vision quest until there's a significant chance of grabbing the reward.)<br/><br/>(If and when I actually get around to it. Don't hold your breath. And of course, I might end up trying it with my shorter-term group and going with the one-shot setup anyway.)<br/><br/>--R                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
