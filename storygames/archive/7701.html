We played what was retroactively labeled "<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26609.msg254426#msg254426" rel="nofollow">Generation Fleet Zodiac</a>" and it was the highlight of my con.  So I begged Tony to let me be involved in playtesting it so I could let me group experience the same emotional supercharge I got from the game.<br/><br/>I ran three games of it, two for my Monday night group and one for the generous StoryGamers gathering in Boston.  It's didn't work out perfectly, but we had a good amount of fun, and some frustration trying out the rules.  My playtest reports follow and your comments are most welcome.<br/><br/>*For reference:<br/>   (R) = Role card; (P)= Personality; (A) = attached Attitude card; (H) = attached Hangup card<br/>  Argument / arguing is used to note use of in-game Argument mechanic.<br/><br/><b>Game <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a></b>: Monday Night Group (3 players plus I as the GM)<br/>Concept: Japan, near-future teen rock band called "Teddy Bear Assassin"<br/><br/><b>Characters:</b><br/><br/>Sabre (Male Drummer)<br/>Scrapper (R); Flamboyant (P); Arrogant (A)<br/>Dream: Want's Jet to be the replacement to the little brother that he lost; but if he articulates this desires to Jet, Sabre fears revealing his own shameful negligance that caused his real little brother's disappearance.  Sabre is jealous of Miyako because she receives so much of Jet's attention.<br/><br/>Jet (Male Lead Guitar)<br/>Prodigy (R); Naive (P); Cut Loose (H)<br/>Dream: Wants Miyako's eternal love but fears her rejection as he is several years yonger than her.  Dislikes Asuka because her "reckless competence" always keeps things going smoothly and prevents Jet showing off to Miyako that he's a real man who can handle a crisis.<br/><br/>Miyako (Female Lead Vocals)<br/>Royaly (R); Perky (P); Prejudiced (A)<br/>Dream: Wants Sabre's to propose to her but fears that he would never be willing to ask her father who is the emperor.  And hates that that stupid kid Jet is always hanging around and messing up these perfect romantic moments for Sabre and her.<br/><br/>Asuka (Female Manager) - GM's Player character<br/>Obedient (R); Cheerleader (P)<br/>Dream: Want's to convince Sabre to replace Miyako as Lead vocalists so that Asuka can then impress him by her skills as a drummer.  Hates that Miyako is so stuck up that she will never give Sabre a chance to sing and prove how good he is.<br/><br/><br/>For this first game, I tried out two of the starting options - GM having a character and players starting with no cards in hand.  Players did not feel beholden to play their own gender and seemed eager to create characters even before we discussed the concept.  Workshopping dreams took some time, but the small group (3 players + GM) made it go reasonably fast.  I set the first scene as backstage just finishing a concert.  We let the scene run freely so that players could roleplay to get cards and then, to provide initial impetus, we introduced that the band had been invited to participate in the "Lunar Band Challenge".  I'll note that the strong archetypes for the role and personality gave players good fodder for initial character portrayal and everyone just jumped in strongly.  After the first scene I invited the players to suggest ones they would like.<br/><br/>In follow on scenes we had:<br/>-Miyako arguing to try to dress the band in ridiculous purple sequins.<br/>-The two boys, pursued by fans on the way to the space elevator, duck in a soup shop.  The elderly woman offers the boys free soup because they look hungry and remonstrates Sabre for letting his "little brother" get so thin.  I framed this scene to provide opportunity for Sabre's dream.<br/>-In the space elevator where the band discovers their arch-rivals, the band "Lightning Frog" (backed by their mysterious leader Dr. Zo) announce they are also on the wayt to the Lunar Band Challenge.<br/>-Miyako and Asuka arguing in the shower overhear "Lightning Frog" and Dr. Zo discussing how they plan to kidnap "the most valuable member of Teddy Bear Assassin".<br/>-Argument in the bands apartment over who is the "most valuable member".<br/>-Bar scene where Jet, dressed up as Miyako (previous argument winner) springs "Lightning Frog's" trap.  Each band member is confronted by their counterpart from "Lightning Frog", who all seem equally confused as who to grab while Dr. Zo shouts "No you fools!  I said the most IMPORTANT one!".  Essentially it turned into an argument between all the PCs as to who was the most valuable one, with Asuka winning the argument to convince "Lightning Frog" she was most valuable (sacrificing herself to save the others).<br/><br/>The remainder of the game assumed a sort of technicolor drug haze - with Asuka kidnapped in LF's spaceship; only for LF to be kidnapped in turn by the "Rockaliens" and their leader, Elvis.  Then Teddy Bear Assassin tried to prove their worth (and save Asuka) by a final concert aboard the alien ship with Jet using Rockscalibur (after freeing the amazing star guitar from its crystal prison aboard the alien ship).  They won, but the end of the game barely interacted with the game rules in a meaningful way.  I tried to use Arguments and Forces, but they seemed flat or artificial within the scenes.  And the burden of resolving all these other actions by GM fiat (essentially introducing conflict and then deciding how it resolved) was unenthusing to me (if the content was full of fun color).<br/><br/>We had a lot of laughs and created some fun color, but the game wasn't truly satisfying to me (and I believe the other players) since it appears to have occurred in a fashion unrelated to the resolution mechanics (but not unrelated to the role/personality cards).  Also, we had trouble creating Forces that actually were uncomfortable for the target to answer "yes" or "no" to.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Flynn" title="Flynn"><img alt="Flynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Flynn">Flynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171006/#Comment_171006" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T13:19:33+00:00" title="September 24, 2008  1:19PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Feedback and thoughts from Game #1:</b><br/>1) Hangups are a cool mechanic, but confusing (at least to a new player), as the card title suggests one thing but the side text speaks about the opposite.  Jet's player used it incorrectly and realized she would not have attached it if she understood the card correctly.  I recommend making the card title match the way the card is normally used (to draw cards by acting in line with the hangup) instead of the exception case (discarding the card to overcome the hangup).  So "Cut Loose" might be renamed as "Repressed" or "Can't Relax".<br/><br/>2) Dreams to some players seemed to be something they felt they could NOT pursue in the game, despite opportunities, because of their character's fears.  Perhaps a miscommunication on my part, but the text should make clear that dreams are starting places and not set in stone.<br/><br/>3) This group is VERY used to cooperation as their general state so they just naturally avoided meaningful conflict between characters. Additionally, the presence of a group nemesis distorted play.  The game shines in intragroup conflict but outside of that it's all GM fiat so it seems just like story time if PCs are going against an outside threat.<br/><br/>4) The GM having a real character (instead of standard GM role/personality) distracted me from doing a good job of focusing on the PC's dreams.  Maybe if the GM's character is very active in hitting the other PC's dreams/fears it might work.  But my obdient cheerleader just didn't seem suited to pressing issues strongly with the other PCs.<br/><br/>5) It's important for me to realize that the story/plot can be fun but has no meaning beyond how it stresses the PC's relationships or provides opportunities for their dreams.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Flynn" title="Flynn"><img alt="Flynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Flynn">Flynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171007/#Comment_171007" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T13:20:24+00:00" title="September 24, 2008  1:20PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2008 1:23PM by Flynn.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Game <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a></b>: StoryGames Boston Gathering<br/>Concept: First graduating class of the lunar high school with lots of Japanese focus on status<br/><br/>This game started slowly, but eventually settled down to 5 players plus myself.  We settled on pretty low-key situation with just a little weird color.  It was all played pretty straight and could have been set today on earth with no changes.  Creating characters was slightly slow, but creating dreams for everyone was agonizingly slow.  Players had a lot of difficulty meeting the requirements, especially of reasons why the target of their dream couldn't find out.  We kept workshopping them, trying to create interesting conflicts that touched on different characters, but the mostly seemed to focus on a small set.<br/><br/><b>Characters:</b><br/><br/>Hiroko (Top scoring female student)<br/>Naive (P) Bookworm (R)<br/>Dream: Wants Carlos as her Prom King, but fears rejection and the shame of pairing with a lower class student.  Hates Sara as she is also lower-class and a better match for Carlos.<br/><br/>Yukiko (Female student with a very masculine mein)<br/>Vain (P) Royalty (R)<br/>Dream: Wants to be friends with Carlos because he is an exciting outsider but fears his scorn.  Shun is blacking her desire as his opinion carries great weight and he has convinced the student body to ostracise Carlos.<br/><br/>Shun (Cross-dressing male student of ambiguous sexuality, feminine mein)<br/>Flamboyant (P) Cheerleader (R)<br/>Dream: Wants to Yukiko's Prom Queen(!) but fears that it would change their platonic relationship forever into something sexual.  Dislikes Carlos as he has started attraction attention from the student body away from Yukiko where it rightfully belongs.<br/><br/>Sara (Tomboy female student)<br/>Frantic (P) Scrapper (R)<br/>Dream: Wants to be Yukikio's Prom Queen but fears appearing submissive and weak to Yukiko.  Hates Shun because he is the perfect female (even as a fake) that she can never be.<br/><br/>Carlos (classic leather jacket, motorcycle wearing male)<br/>Brooding (P) Rebel (R)<br/>Dream: Wants to be Yukiko's King but only to use her fame to be popular himself.  He fears her rejection and hates her for her vainity and arrogance.<br/><br/>I started the game with every player having 2 cards and I chose not to have a character in order to focus solely on the GM role.  The game started with a vote for what the them of the "prom" would be and the theme of the prom, along with everyone's dreams, absorbed pretty much the rest of the game.  We had lots of scenes of Shun and Yikiko orchestrating the embarrassment of other students in order to keep them in their place.  We also had side plots of people who tried to defend Carlos (especially Sara) or bring down Hiroko from he pedestal of acadmic perfection.<br/><br/>There was a lot of confusion, probably caused by my explanation of the game, regarding how much control over the end of scene the winner of an argument could exert.  And some people were frustrated that Arguments sometimes seemed resolved but didn't influence later scenes as much as they expected/desired.  The game produced some enjoyable scenes and was more focused on intragroup conflict, but the resolution mechanics still felt to me like they weren't helping that much in pushing the game forward.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Flynn" title="Flynn"><img alt="Flynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Flynn">Flynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171008/#Comment_171008" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T13:20:48+00:00" title="September 24, 2008  1:20PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Player Questions:</b><br/>1) Can the GM attach cards (Attitudes/Hangups) to the standard GM role card and, if so, how does that affect the fiction?<br/>2) Must all player characters be teenagers?<br/>3) Once a card is attached, can you later replace it with a different attachable card of the same type (Attitude/Hangup) without spending the originally attached card (i.e. just discarding it)?<br/><br/><b>Player Feedback:</b><br/>1) Some of the players we very familiar with Japan, Japanese high school, and Shojo.  They were concerned that if this game is marketed as emulating Shojo, it only handles a subset (and some shonin).  It does not handle Shojo horror like "Vampire Princess Mu" and "Pet Shop of Horrors".  Also might be problematic for Sailor Moon, where after the first season there is really no Intra-party conflict.<br/><br/>2) A strong desire for more cards or for recycling the discards.  Felt that the economy of cards was weak.<br/><br/>3) Low value cards are distributed randomly, but are fairly useless at the end of the game.  Several players couldn't be involved meaningfully in the final arguments or perform strong Forces because they had only low value cards.  Maybe alternate rule to play several low values cards as their combined value?<br/><br/>4) Suggest that the game starts with more cards in hand so that early scenes can have strong conflicts.<br/><br/>5) The cooperative (voicing opinions, interesting narration using the card titles as inspiration) are in conflict with the competitive aspects in the game (Arguments, Forces).  For some players the numbers become an impossible distraction from the context of the cards.  So they pass only low value cards and play high value card for their value alone, even though they may not be relevant to their character or the argument.<br/><br/>6) Seems that in many cases, playing a mid-value card in an argument with several players is just a formality as it's almost never worthwhile.  Some players expressed that they would prefer to lose immediately.<br/><br/>7) As a possible fix to encourage playing low/mid value cards in an arguments, make the final narration/decision incorporate something from the context (title) of all the cards played in some fashion?<br/><br/>8) Consider moving the "this card beats that card" (e.g. "Wise beats Cunning") to the lower value cards so that they can have meaning in later conflicts.<br/><br/>9) Unclear whether winning an argument gives any control over the story, the other characters actions, or the scene's outcome (i.e. narrational authority) or just gets the last word.<br/><br/>10) Consider random distribution of personality and role cards.<br/><br/>11) Consider including a list of good (and weak/bad) example dreams for inspiration.  Also consider some way of randomly generating Shojo appropriate dreams / goals / or targets of desire and opposition.<br/><br/>12) Forces in general did not seem awkward for the target character to answer.  Additionally as the Japanese are known for their discretion and being indirect, they seemed out of place in a game emulating Japanese fiction.  Maybe have a limit of 1 Force per character per game?  Or only enable them if you have a specific high value card in hand.<br/><br/>13) It would be good if there was a way to mark a Hangup that has been "charged" (i.e. covered and then uncovered and now possessing the +20 bonus).<br/><br/>14) Scrapper caused confusion as to how to play as a role, in this game as well in the first Monday night game.  Might be helpful to rethink or provide better hints?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Flynn" title="Flynn"><img alt="Flynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Flynn">Flynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171010/#Comment_171010" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T13:26:01+00:00" title="September 24, 2008  1:26PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2008 1:34PM by Flynn.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Game <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a></b>: Monday night group round 2 (with 4 players plus myself as GM).<br/><br/>Concept: Only survivors living in the creche of crumbling post-apocalyptic underground vault<br/><br/><b>Characters:</b><br/><br/>Zefiru (Male)<br/>Selfless (P) Dreamer (R)<br/>Dream: Wants to leave the vault with Kiki and rebuild civilization on the surface but fears Kiki\\'s rejection and having to settle for Yuki.  Hates that Mangeo is always dismissing returns to the surface as impossible because of radiation and other dangers.<br/><br/>Mangeo (Male)<br/>Naive (P) Geek (R)<br/>Dream: Wants to activate \\"the button\\" in hopes that it will start a terraforming process to restore the world.  He needs Zefiru\\'s to go outside the vault an cooperate in the activatation sequence, but fear if given the chance Zefiru will flee the vault.

Hates Mangeo as he is the subject of Kiki\\'s affections.<br/><br/>Once again I opted to take the GM role and personality cards.  And I chose to experiment by having the PCs be the ONLY people in the world.  And as our time was very limited (about 1 hr left after character creation and dreams) I started players with 3 cards in hand.  I chose to represent myself as \\"Teacher\\", the AI that ran the creche (decorated in teddy bears and butterflies) and treated these young adults as if they were children.<br/><br/>The group this time was better focused on intragroup conflict and we had some pretty good scenes.  Teacher started off by announcing the imminent failure of the fusion reactor and the need for the children to elect a leader among them prior to effecting a repair mission.  This got a good argument going off the bat and helped set up the tensions on all sides for the montage of exploration scenes into the depths of the crumbling vault.  Teacher was constantly issues ridiculous and contrary demands (e.g. telling the children to return immediately to the cafeteria else they would earn demerits for being late for lunch while they were rappelling down a shaft on the mission Teacher had given them earlier).  The characters conspired against one another, even moving toward clumsy attempts at murder and brinkmanship.<br/><br/>The game played very fast and we burned through the draw deck in almost no time, zooming to an end.  I felt it was much more successful than out first game because I focused on the GM role and the PCs with the only characters so all scenes necessarily involved their interaction.  The ending was a little weak because some players had exhausted their cards and I didn\\'t frame a strong enough scene.  Although Arguments were on the whole entertaining, Forces again had no real energy or embarrassment - the one or two that were used were easily answered without pushback or concern.<br/><br/><b>Player feedback:</b><br/>1) Felt like for such a short game the dreams created too many competing objectives.  Might have been more fun to focus only on 1 dream                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Flynn" title="Flynn"><img alt="Flynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Flynn">Flynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171011/#Comment_171011" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T13:27:42+00:00" title="September 24, 2008  1:27PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Final thoughts after 3 games:<br/><br/>I don't think I had a home run with any of these games - maybe a double at best.<br/><br/>The most salient thought I have is that I'm not nearly as effective a GM of this game as Tony is.  I don't lack for confidence or experience as a GM in general, and have run some very fun and effective campaigns using more traditional systems.  I've had some good success with a handful of indie games (SOTC, TSOY) but I feel that my skill in running these games are on the whole weaker - for instance I feel like I flounder when trying to come up with a good conflict for someone's issue in PTA.<br/><br/>So I think this weakness is really telling in this game.  Additionally, although I am immersed in medieval fantasy and have no problem improvising in such a setting, I find that I have no such facility for the Shojo genre or high school situations in general.  I don't even feel I have a wealth of personal experience to draw on, as I wasn't an angsty teen and my life was remarkable free of drama (other than being bullied a little for being a geek).<br/><br/>So some of the blame for lack of great success definitely falls on my shoulders.  I did my best to explain my understanding of the rules and what kind of play experience the game was trying to evoke.  On the whole the players were interested and tried their best to engage in the game.  We definitely had fun, but there were frustrating moments of groping after interesting scenes and good conflicts for arguments or forces.<br/><br/>Perhaps my expectations where set too high after Generation Fleet Zodiac, but I was really hoping to bring the emotional energy of that game home with me.  Its didn't work out.  I'm certain there maybe some tweaks to the rules that could improve the experience (see the feedback in earlier emails), but I think what is needed most of all from my perspective is instructions on technique and examples of what you're trying to achieve in play.  A suggested bibliography or filmography would go a long way too, I think.<br/><br/>Maybe armed with those I could make another, more successful foray.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171032/#Comment_171032" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T14:19:24+00:00" title="September 24, 2008  2:19PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2008 2:26PM by Eric.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was playing Shun in game 2, and my wife was playing Yukiko. We were both quite heavily invested in the genre, to the point that our characters were both pure genre pieces. <br/><br/>Shun started out as a <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholesomeCrossdresser" rel="nofollow">wholesome crossdresser</a> <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Keet" rel="nofollow">keet,</a> probably as the uke in a <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoysLove" rel="nofollow">boys love</a> storyline or subplot. I basically made a <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoeMoe" rel="nofollow">moe blob</a> to appeal to the show's theoretical audience. The name and many of the attributes were drawn heavily from Shun of <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KokoWaGreenwood" rel="nofollow">Here is Greenwood.</a> The character drifted pretty quickly into a more antagonistic role due to how things played out.<br/><br/>Yukiko was a classic <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen" rel="nofollow">bifauxnen</a> archetype of the Haruka Tenou school, and rolled out pretty much like Haruka on a bad day. April played the archetype to very good effect, saying maybe five lines of dialogue over the session - and each one had huge impact. The character probably could have played out with more emphasis on the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWomanWearingTheQueenlyMask" rel="nofollow">Queenly Mask,</a> maybe something in the His and Her Circumstances kind of way, but wound up very much towards the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch" rel="nofollow">Rich Bitch</a> side of things.<br/><br/>I say all this with all those links mostly to demonstrate our level of genre investment. That was a pretty significant problem at times due to genre-whiplash from our side of the table (Prom? What's this "prom" you speak of?), with the analogous genre confusion from the other side (what the hell is "EGL," and why does the school allow a crossdresser?). April and I derived a lot of enjoyment from the pure genre exercise, but I'm not sure how much the mechanics contributed to that. <br/><br/>Edit:<br/>I have a lot floating around my head about the game, but probably the first is pinning down exactly what sort of show this this is supposed to emulate or tie in with. The Shoujo demographic is huge, encompassing horror, action, romance, gory violence, and cooking comics that mirror boys' sports comics, to name a few. I feel like this game is aimed at a much smaller subset of that, probably the "tears and cherry blossoms" sort of stuff that Americans usually associate most with Shoujo, but I definitely think it would help to pin it down (at least for players like April and I; we actually showed up wanting do to Vampire Princess Miyu).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171426/#Comment_171426" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T06:47:20+00:00" title="September 26, 2008  6:47AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool!

I believe I introduced aliens as interrupting LF's kidnapping of Asuka.  Then one of the players declared that they were the intergalactic music aficionados, the Rockaliens.  Later, it seemed obvious so I said their leader was Elvis.  Finally, Jet's player invented out of whole cloth Rockscalibur as on objective that would help the band win over the Rockaliens.  I definitely embraced the players contributions (I was laughing too hard not to), but it was not one sided.<br/><br/>As another example, when the players had to reach the alien ship, and their seemed like no obvious way to do so, one of them declared that they "summoned their space ship" - which lead to a description cribbed from bad Saturday morning cartoons of a Voltron like, "and I'll form the head", affair with various robots emerging from places on earth, flying into space, and merging into a rock &amp; roll spaceship.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>Can you give me an example of an argument that fell flat?</blockquote>\nBecause of the unity of the group's purpose, the fact they were opposing an external threat, and the fact that all external contests are resolved by GM fiat I struggled with the boringness of introducing and resolving conflict with no player input (except descriptive).  So I tried to bend the external threats to target group issues and permit the use of Arguments or Forces to decide how they overcame certain obstacles.<br/><br/>As an example, when the group was contesting for Asuka's life I had Elvis initiate an Argument that the group was "too young and inexperienced" and hadn't achieved the depth of spirit true rock &amp; roll deserved.  I was trying to use the emotional/social mechanics of the game to permit resolution of the plot.  Fundamentally, the argument i made was probably too general and not targeted enough against the player's dreams.  But it also felt somewhat jarring as the players had narrated cool actions to try to free Asuka but I felt that, absent of engaging with the mechanics in some way, it would be meaningless and "lame" to just return her.  Maybe that's brain damage from a more traditional mode of play or sensitivity to acting arbitrarily as the GM without some outside rational (e.g. the resolution mechanic said to do it).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>Can you give me an example of a failed one?</blockquote>\nAs this was three weeks ago, nothing jumps to mind from this game.

The introduction of the aliens was the very next scene, as I was struggling to frame the exit of LF and Asuka after the capture.  There were no scenes among the remaining characters between the end of the argument at the arrival of aliens.<br/><br/>My train of thought went like this:<br/>-Both parties were on a passenger car of a space elevator, being raised into orbit at the time of the kidnapping<br/>-How was LF going to get Asuka off the passenger car except by taking her into space?<br/>-I need to establish a plausible, but not impossible, barrier for the players to overcome<br/><br/>I narrated the PCs watching from a nearby window as LF left the passenger car on a previously hidden spaceship attached to the hull.  Now, on reflection, I seem to recall that at this point someone joking voiced, "And that's when the aliens arrive" (my memory is not entirely reliable in this matter) and so I immediately incorporated it into my narration as it matched the wacky anime spirit of the game so far.

The outcome was completely irrelevant to me, since my objective was to simply force him deal with the question, so I used a mid-value card. I believe Carlos trumped it with a high-value card, deflecting the question and shrugging it off. I considered this a massive win for my side: Carlos now looks like a jerk to the theoretical 12-year-old Japanese girl audience, and Dan (playing Carlos) burned a high card in the process.<br/><br/>Sara made a force versus Yukiko with some statement to the affect of "go out with me." April (playing Yukiko) felt awkward at this point, since she was going to have Yukiko turn Sara down, and Angela (playing Sara) could have saved a card by just asking and gotten the same response. Yukiko replied coldly, "Some things just are not to be." There was a question here about if April could say a short synonym for "no" or had to use "no" explicitly. April and I both find it very problematic to just say "no" because of how extremely rarely characters in the reference material and in the original Japanese would say "no."

Questions like "How is LF going to get Asuka off the passenger car?" seem like they should take a back seat to things like "How does Sabre, who failed to prevent the disappearance of his little brother, respond to the kidnapping of one of his friends?" and "Will Jet use this chaos to try to prove to Miyako that he's a real man who can handle himself in a crisis?"<br/><br/>So, I'd like to figure out where the rules can be improved, in order to push people strongly in that direction.  Do you have some sense of what you'd have needed to hear from the rules in order to emphasize the emotion-oriented mind-set?  I'm looking particularly at the "Little stakes, Big stakes" panel of the rules, which goes like this:<blockquote>External things unrelated to someone's dream will almost always be small issues in this game.  Apocalypse, imminent alien invasion, etc.  Small optatoes.<br/><br/>External things linked to the dream will be a bigger deal, even if they're (objectively) very small.  If elections for class president are how someone's going to help their friend shine, that's a big, big deal.  Give people opportunities to engage that kind of material.<br/><br/>The biggest of big deals is when someone takes the chance of revealing their dream to its subject.  You can't force this, but you want to clear a space where it can happen if they choose.</blockquote>In retrospect, this section is incredibly meandering and clunky:  I want to refine it so that it points more directly at giving the GM specific "Do X, don't do Y, if you're thinking about A do B instead" sort of advice.  Is there any insight you can offer in terms of what you would have needed to hear in order to recognize these issues in the moment rather than in hindsight?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171533/#Comment_171533" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T13:14:19+00:00" title="September 26, 2008  1:14PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 26, 2008 1:17PM by Eric.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>Eric:  It sounds very much (to me) like the idea that this was a shoujo game largely ruined your ability to actually play it without being totally self-conscious.

Romping around in it in a somewhat simulationist way, placing high priority on the fidelity of the genre tropes and faithful representation of the archetypes of character and plot arc, is very natural and enjoyable to us. There's a degree of self-consciousness there, I'm sure, but it's a source of fun rather than a burden. <br/><br/>A really big thing, though, is that we suddenly have different expectations for what kinds of stories and characters make sense. We have thing mantra of "Story Now!" in narrativist play, right? Well, what kind of story? What kinds of stories make sense, and what is the cultural context into which they are embedded? April and I are sufficiently invested in the Shoujo demographic and its genres that "playing Shoujo" more or less forces a specific cultural context, as well as additional constraints based on genre and sub-genre.<br/><br/>I do think our enjoyment of "Shoujo" and investment in it detracted from our ability to share our story and our fun with the rest of the table, but we still had quite a bit of fun regardless.<br/><br/>Edit: thinking about your question a bit more, I think April and I regarded "This is Shoujo" as the most important "rule" of the system. All other aspects of the system were forced by us to conform to that prime rule. From that standpoint, I don't doubt that our ability to "actually play it" was strongly informed by our one overriding mandate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171537/#Comment_171537" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T13:23:07+00:00" title="September 26, 2008  1:23PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 26, 2008 1:25PM by Eric.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>The biggest of big deals is when someone takes the chance of revealing their dream to its subject.

Look, if it's your one terrifying thing, then why would you ever reveal it? Why not just engineer events so that it happens without revealing it?<br/><br/>You emphasized the importance of the fear quite a lot, that we'd basically regard our lives as wrecked if it was revealed.

Glad to see you in the playtest - the GenCon game was hella fun.<br/><br/>So, a couple of things - note, I'm about to swing hard with "the way it should be" kind of talk. That doesn't mean I'm convinced I'm right, it just means that my understanding is a certain way. Tony, anybody, feel free to correct and redirect as necessary; I'm not going to argue.\n<blockquote><cite>Eric asked:</cite>Look, if it's your one terrifying thing, then why would you ever reveal it? Why not just engineer events so that it happens without revealing it?</blockquote>\nA few reasons. First off, if everyone does that, the play that results is pretty boring from a dramatic perspective. In fiction, the most useless piece of information is a secret that is actually kept. There's an implicit conceit in place (which should maybe be more explicit?) that the content of the dreams is what the game's "about" in a human sense - the events of play should change the status quo between the characters enough to reflect on those fears and bring them boiling to the surface, whether the characters' necessarily want them to or not. <br/><br/>Fidelity to the genre conceits is vastly, vastly secondary to this priority - the cards reinforce what needs to be reinforced pretty much by themselves. I ran one game of it at GenCon with someone (Graham W, if anyone's curious) who had no real points of reference to shoujo, and it totally didn't matter.<br/><br/>Second, oftentimes it will be pretty hard to fulfill your dream without the other character who plays a role in that dream being complicit - or at least, it should be pretty hard. If you could easily convince the person to play their role in your dream without telling them about it, or contrive circumstances so it could just happen, the dream is probably weak.<br/><br/>Third, almost nothing in <i>Misery Bubblegum</i> has to do with making commentary as <b>players</b> on the actual state of the fiction - it's just about what a character perceives or thinks. There's nothing that suggests your fear will come true - many fears are founded in false expectations. So you can't, as a player, take it as a given that your characters will consider their lives ruined if their dream is revealed... that's for the outcome of play to determine. For all you know, silly Brooding Bookworm, Ayako would actually be attracted to you if you got up the nerve to tell her how you feel. The fact that you don't has nothing to do with Ayako. It has to do with your fear of rejection.<br/><br/>All this said, you can work with the dreams without necessarily having to reveal them. The key is pressure. If the events of play don't drive you to reveal your secret, then they should push you into going to extremes to protect it. This also rocks. However you use them, though, the thing you can't do is allow external conflicts to dominate and render the dreams unimportant. They should always tie back in.<br/><br/>So, Adam, in your first game, this is pretty much where I think things went wrong - after the Rockaliens show up, the dreams pretty much vanish into the background... we don't get anything about Sabre's dead brother, the conflicting attractions of Miyako and Jet, or Asuka's desire to shake up the status quo. All the stuff that was supposed to provide thematic value pretty much stopped mattering. <br/><br/>I think I can respond to some of your other comments too, which I'll reserve for a second post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171843/#Comment_171843" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-29T02:18:39+00:00" title="September 29, 2008  2:18AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More followup for Adam:\n<blockquote>Maybe alternate rule to play several low values cards as their combined value?</blockquote>\nI kind of dig that as a potential special function for the Stakes cards alone. Do you think that this would make those cards more valuable than their current function of "force the GM to narrate X"?\n<blockquote>For some players the numbers become an impossible distraction from the context of the cards.

I mean, the card's title is part of the card - if you aren't playing it and it's obvious, it's incumbent on the group (or the GM at least) to say something to you about it.\n<blockquote>9) Unclear whether winning an argument gives any control over the story, the other characters actions, or the scene's outcome (i.e. narrational authority) or just gets the last word.</blockquote>\nAs far as I understand it, it only gets you the last word. So, for example, a scene where I win an argument by saying, "We're going to do it my way, and that's final!" could transition into a scene where you're sabotaging my plan behind my back. Same thing with a Force - the response you give might be a total lie. C'est la vie - now you have to live with the lie.\n<blockquote>12) Forces in general did not seem awkward for the target character to answer.</blockquote>\nThis suggests the need for better rules instruction to me, rather than fixing the mechanic - in just about every one of the games I've participated in or have run, a Force applied in a moment of tension totally changed the direction of the narrative, as characters' "true colors" got revealed one way or another. For a Force to work right, there has to be a lot at stake in the question.<br/><br/>In general, I think the rule text needs a whole lot of very close handholding about when it's ideal to apply the mechanics. There's a lot of potential for mixed priorities, I think, because of the language involved... 'arguments' and 'forcing', etc. <br/><br/>Baasically, I don't think the mechanics are intended to be competitive on the player-player level at all. The reason to have an argument is to put pressure on the situation between the characters, not necessarily to win. The reason to have a Force is to reveal the crap that people won't admit to, whether in that moment or later when it's revealed that someone lied... not necessarily to have it go your way or get the answer you want.\n<blockquote>There was a question here about if April could say a short synonym for "no" or had to use "no" explicitly.</blockquote>\nYes, no, or flee the scene. Period dot. This, to me, is what separates just asking from using the card, which should suggest what level of "down to the wire" you should ideally be at before the Force comes out. If you don't use the card, a lot of things could potentially happen - the asker could retract the question at the first sign of awkwardness, you can talk around it, etc. If you use the card and win, only three things can happen.<br/><br/>The fact that there's a Japanese cultural tendency to be indirect and discreet about sensitive issues, never say "no" directly, etc. - this is precisely what makes Forcing so potentially powerful if you're striving to play accurately to the milieu. It puts something on the table in the most direct way possible. These moments absolutely can and do occur in the source material... the trick is when they occur - that character has to be desperate enough for an answer to bypass deeply ingrained social norms for it. I'd agree, though, that this is far less prominent in shoujo than other subgenres.<br/><br/>Adam, before I go, I have a question I really, really want you to answer: did you feel, because of your GenCon experience, obligated to "finish the story" after a single session of play? If so, do you think that impacted your games any?

If I played in a more authoritarian role where I was dictating the next scene every time with minimal player input, the stake cards in their current form would have more value.<br/><br/>Do I think combining stake cards would make them more valuable? Probably not as their values are so low you would need more than five (the max hand size limit) to really compete against a midvalue or higher card.  I prefer the fix where the "Wise beats Cunning" mechanic is transferred to these lower value cards so there are specific instances where they are highly useful.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Leonard Balsera</cite>did you feel, because of your GenCon experience, obligated to "finish the story" after a single session of play? </blockquote>\nI'll admit that I never considered it really valuable or interesting to try to get two play sessions out of the same setting / characters.  But I'm fairly certain this opinion was not explicitly because of my GenCon experience alone.  I read a number of MB playtests (most of them from Tony) prior to running the game myself and there didn't seem so to be much emphasis on re-playing the same characters.  Additionally, although the rules text state that you can play more than a single session using the same characters, it's explained in an off-hand way as if to suggest it's a less valuable option.  Lastly, it would seem that after the dreams of the characters are exposed and resolved in some fashion, it would appear that most of the "meat" is off the bones at that point.  MB was exciting to me as exemplifying that pick up and play ethic where continuity of narrative from session to session wasn't a real concern.<br/><br/>So I would describe it this way - I felt that when the draw deck was exhausted, we should have already pressed on several characters dreams and the group should now be pushing for resolution not only of the overarching story but of some or all PCs dreams.  I didn't set resolution of all the characters dreams (positively or negatively) as an explicit requirement, just as a goal.  But having an understandable end to the initial situation (playing at the lunar band challenge, going to the prom, repairing the fusion reactor) as a way of creating structure in the story (as opposed to amorphous collection of events with no progression to an end) was definitely my intention.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Leonard Balsera</cite>If so, do you think that impacted your games any? If so, how?</blockquote>\nI think it caused me to to think in every scene "How can I.." (a) create a scene to target/expose a character's dream or (b) How can I create additional interest by developing the overarching situation (either increasing or resolving tension) or (c) both.  I think it also caused me to unintentionally ignore Tony's advice about having "small scenes" that are allowed to develop as opposed to "big scenes" - in many but not all cases.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Flynn" title="Flynn"><img alt="Flynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Flynn">Flynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171916/#Comment_171916" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-29T11:46:44+00:00" title="September 29, 2008 11:46AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, some feedback from one of my Monday night players that I'm posting on his behalf:\n<blockquote><br/>Here are some thoughts on MB:<br/><br/>  * I was a little put off by the role of the GM; I understand the need for someone who gives the game direction, but I don't like the idea that that person also decides the outcomes of conflicts.

I could even imagine the "At Stake" card being played not just with a new card played simultaneously, but on a card you previously played in an Argument or Force to raise it's value (and re-introduce it's contextual fiction in a modified form) as follows:<br><br>Player A plays Kind (value 12) and says, "You're being so rude. Why don't you just give Asuka a chance to explain?"<br/><br/>Player B plays Angry (value 16) and states, "I don't have time to pay attention to this idiot!"<br/><br/>Player A plays At Stake: Respect (+5) to combine with his previous Kind card (for a new total of 17) and states, "I used to look up to you.

Good thought.  I'll update the cards.<br/><br/>Do you think that a menu of "Here are the goals you should seek when setting a scene" would be helpful for the GM?

Both times, I noticed a very sharp contrast from my con games, which was that both groups were immediately inclined to a more deliberate approach toward building conflict and tension, addressing the issues suggested by the dreams, and "completing" a story, so to speak. The default assumption was that there was going to be a second game with that set of characters, wherein the group could build on and address whatever didn't get resolved the first time around.<br><br>The thing is, this happened even with those groups knowing that these were probably one-shots - like, it was okay to let the fiction proceed at its own pace. The first game, we ended before we reached the end of the deck, because it was the right moment. The second game, we only used the final cards to do mini-scenes that covered the denouement. In each game, there were dreams that took a back seat to other dreams, and a couple that were resolved by private character choices, instead of via character interaction. More like, "X happened, so character makes Y choice, and that means Z regarding their dream."<br/> <br/>The net effect was that both games were a lot less emotionally intense than my GenCon experiences, more with the slow burn than the flare-up. I didn't, however, see it as altogether a bad thing - given enough time, I could totally see a full night of gaming MB involving taking up the deck after the cards are done, reshuffling, picking a new catalyst event and followup dreams (or not), giving the characters a chance to swap out their character cards if they want, and continuing on.<br/><br/>I don't even think you need the demarcation of "this is a new episode" or anything like that.

We're having a lot of fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that helps <i>a lot</i> (and which I intend to point out as I revise the rules) is pulling back the dreams to something that is "Step One", rather than "All the marbles."  Tonight, Raven's player started by saying "Raven wants Tom Hawke to love her."  I suggested that was a <i>very big</i> goal, and we pulled it back progressively to "She wants him to be attracted" and then to "She wants him to like her."<br/>\n<br/>\nThat way you can <i>give her</i> what she wants, without it burning out the character's drive.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs it turns out, though, we didn't.  It was quite touching to see her plan for making him even <i>like</i> her immediately founder on the unfair expectations of those around her.  If she'd been asking for the moon, we might have said "Well, she didn't deserve that much, so it's fine that she was thwarted" ... but all she was asking was some sign that he enjoyed her company.  She was left, at the end, with the notion that maybe he <i>really really</i> likes her, and that's why he's uncomfortable, but more likely he just finds her generally distasteful and wishes she'd go away.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, of course, we're now completely set to ramp up the exact same desire for being liked, only with another (not yet ruined) cunning plan.  I'm quite psyched to do it.  Her earlier failures just add to her willingness to try more "out there" plans in order to uncover the truth.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm thinking that next time we should get away from the driving external events of spy missions, and just have everyone go out together for a day at the beach.  Summer vacation (in game) after all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Flynn" title="Flynn"><img alt="Flynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Flynn">Flynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172670/#Comment_172670" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-02T14:23:21+00:00" title="October  2, 2008  2:23PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>One thing that helps<em>a lot</em>(and which I intend to point out as I revise the rules) is pulling back the dreams to something that is "Step One", rather than "All the marbles."</blockquote>\nWow - This insight really hits right at the heart of some of the issues I saw with dreams created at the table.

Another thing to consider, I think, is not just the actual dream itself being "Step One," but also the psychology. Even if the dream is discrete and simple and works well as a Step One, it still could be thought of by the player as All The Marbles. <br><br>Like, A-ko wants B-kun to like her, playing off of Tony's example. Tony presents that as Step One, but maybe A-ko's player thinks of it as All The Marbles:<br>"okay, he likes you, now what?" versus "HE LIKES ME, SQUUUEEEEE! I CAN DIE HAPPY!" <br>and also...<br>"oh, damn, you got shot down, now what?" versus "My life is over. *slit wrists*"                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172689/#Comment_172689" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-02T16:22:31+00:00" title="October  2, 2008  4:22PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think, though ... how to put this?<br/>\n<br/>\nNo matter what you think of it objectively, a small goal seems (subjectively) like it's <i>everything in the world</i> until your next episode.  Happy becomes "Happily Ever After" whenever you stop telling the story and let people ride off into the sunset.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the most fascinating quick story-telling I've seen is when people take, like, five minutes at the end of a game and spontaneously say "Well, we're not playing these characters again, but <i>if we were</i>, here's what would happen."  They universally contrive happy endings for the nicest characters (even the ones who got their dreams totally squashed) and bitter simmering unrest for the unkind characters (even the ones who got every aspect of their dreams fulfilled).  It's sorta cool to watch, honestly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
