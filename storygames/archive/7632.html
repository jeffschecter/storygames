It's a lot of fun, but also a bit of stress. Here are some raw thoughts and experiences after a few weeks of doing this:<br/><br/>[EDIT] When re-reading this, I see it looks a lot like I'm dissatisfied with the writers, which is definitely not the case (as I said, everyone needs an editor, even me). I want to specify that the writers are doing a great job - it's fun to read their stuff, they come up with new and interesting ideas, and they're professional and courteous in their communication. This is just me talking about some of the more stressful parts of the job. [/EDIT]<br/><br/>- Every single writer is different. <br/>- Some read everything you write to them, and follow all instructions. Some don't, for whatever reason. My reaction when I get a submission from someone who hasn't followed the writers' guidelines at all? I return it after a quick browse, and ask them to rewrite it. Anything else would a) take an incredible amount of extra time, and b) be an extremely bad start for further work with that writer.<br/>- Some people just flake out, do nothing, and answer only half my mails - or none. One writer has produced nothing, answered nothing, and been asked to return the book we gave them. Other people started early and had their first, second and revised drafts done the day after deadline.<br/>- Some come up with weird and fun ideas, and use their own voice and creativity to make up stuff I wouldn't have thought of. As an editor, I like that and try to encourage it.<br/>- When writing scenarios for teachers, it seems that the best people to use are those who have both written scenarios before and worked as teachers (what a surprise). Those with a lot of role-playing experience, but no didactic experience, tend to underestimate how extremely explicit and simple the instructions have to be. "Play out a conversation with this NPC" is a common example - it's just scary and incomprehensible for many teachers.<br/>- Out of sixteen potential writers, five submitted first drafts before the deadline, two never even submitted a proposal, and the rest are somewhere in between.<br/>- Editing submissions from people I know personally is the hardest. I know where they're coming from, why they write like they do, and I sometimes have to tell them "stop doing your own thing, you have to do our thing now". <br/>- People react surprisingly well to my editors' notes, and rewrite accordingly.<br/>- Everyone needs an editor. E v e r y o n e . I'm very glad I have editors when I write my stuff. They give me a beating and I say "thank you".                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169579/#Comment_169579" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-17T04:42:34+00:00" title="September 17, 2008  4:42AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This lines up pretty well with my experiences with Push 1 &amp; 2.

Try editing eight writers contributing to a single manual into a common voice. Very, VERY time-consuming, even with a seriously rigid style guide (Chicago Manual, supplemented with MS Manual and--if necessary--internal style guide for company-specific shit).<br/><br/>And take screen shots from those eight authors... who have different desktop resolutions and color schemes... and fonts... and a variety of competitor products visible in their taskbars and system trays. At least I was generally in charge of creating/changing callouts (i.e. not baked into the images).<br/><br/>And did I mention that some of those authors are programmers who couldn't write a complete sentence of more than ten words with a gun to their heads? (What's the deal with engineers and articles--you'd think "right brained" people would appreciate disambiguation...?)<br/><br/>Yeah... editing is tough, and it's a rare skill.

Been there. Both those places.<br/><br/>Even worse: editing forms submitted by the public into some kind of consistent style. You think reasonably professional writers are bad at following style guidelines? Try random people who've received honours, or even worse, motel owners.<br/><br/>And often, the ones who are the worst are the ones who bristle the most when you change what they submitted so that it fits with the publication style.<br/><br/>Not that professional writers are immune from that effect. I once edited a series of books of nostalgic photographs. The text was written by a woman who'd been a journalist for decades. I actually resorted to doing a find-and-replace, stripping out all her commas, and then going through again and putting commas where they actually belonged - it was faster than removing them one at a time.<br/><br/>Then my boss was stupid enough to tell her that I was doing that, and she threw a fit. So I had to go back to moving her commas individually.<br/><br/>I'm so glad I'm not an editor any more.<br/><br/>Value your editors! It's a thankless task (if they do it well, nobody will even notice), and as David says, a rare skill.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169914/#Comment_169914" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-18T13:01:23+00:00" title="September 18, 2008  1:01PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2008 1:01PM by Dave Hallett.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh.

You should (in an ideal non-existant editor's utopia) be able to tell a professional writer that <i>this</i>, <i>this</i>, <i>this </i>and <i>this </i>is shit, and <i>this </i>should be changed, without them taking offense. I try to assimilate editorial critique something like this; I'm not perfect, you're not perfect. I may (or may not) know this particular material better than you, since I wrote and researched the article, and interviewed the subjects. Some of your criticism is totally valid, and I'll change it, some of your criticism is valid, but there's a reason for the article being the way it is anyhow (time, available resources, available sources, etc), some of your criticism is either wrong, or I disagree with it (and then I won't change it - sorry). \n<blockquote>The writer is my client and my peer.

It's so easy to forget to point out explicitly and concretely what actually <i>does</i> work in a text. And I think that's important not just to stroke the writers ego and keep his spirits up, but actually to encourage future production of... the good stuff, rather than the fumbling-in-darkness-and-occasionally-stumbling-in-shit stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186175/#Comment_186175" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T01:06:56+00:00" title="January  6, 2009  1:06AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So now I'm editing the Knutepunkt book. We're three editors, working as a team, which is good. This job is a bit harder than the L\xe6relyst scenarios; with L\xe6relyst, there's a very specific structure to follow, while here, the articles are very varied in genre. Some are academic papers, others are more like magazine articles. Some writers just have a bright, enthusiastic idea they want to share. Others have a specific point they want to make, based on lengthy argumentation and references. <br/><br/>It's fun, but I find myself giving out some pretty tough love. This time around, I find refuting articles isn't the hardest thing; the hardest thing is asking people for multiple major rewrites close to deadline, and telling them we can't guarantee publication until we see the finished article. It's hard because I don't like asking people for hard work when they might not get published. And it's hard because we need every article, and I don't like not knowing whether we'll get them all. <br/><br/>I'm also worried that some writers might take it personally. In my experience, though, people usually don't. I mean, they probably swear at the editor while going through their document and doing all those annoying little rewrites; I know I sometimes do. But they know their ideas are appreciated and taken seriously, which is what every writer wants in the end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186183/#Comment_186183" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T04:17:38+00:00" title="January  6, 2009  4:17AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matthijs, I totally feel you.

On the contrary, most of them seemed quite happy about it.<br/>- We lost a few articles that I'd have liked to see finished. Some for practical reasons, some because of lazy authors (their words, not mine), some because the ideas needed to mature more and be tested in practice before publication.<br/>- It's amazing how much work you can get done just before deadline.<br/>- The book ain't finished until you hold the physical object in your hands. This is both good and bad. Good, because it means you can make a lot of last-minute changes. Bad, because - see next point...<br/>- It can ALWAYS be better. Always. I look at articles that have been rewritten five times, passed through the hands of two editors and a proofreader, and I still see room for improvement. So we proofread it just one more time.<br/>- Being a team really, really helps. It's so good to have someone to talk to about the articles, even if it's just for a few minutes or a thirty-second phone call. When we've agreed that "this is how we do it", it's a whole different thing from "this is how I want to do it".<br/>- Communication can always be better. You can always be faster in your responses, more accurate in the expectations you communicate to people.<br/>- All comments from editors, proofreaders and your mom are suggestions, and the author is in absolute control of their article.

Working for free doesn't necessarily make others grateful.<br/>- The best things in the world are love and happiness. <br/>- Communicate, communicate, communicate. Be respectful, which means you have to be both gentle and strict.<br/>- Ten hours of proofreading will make you a little tired.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199219/#Comment_199219" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-28T16:48:15+00:00" title="March 28, 2009  4:48PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I appreciated the hell out of the comments you and your colleague made on my Knutepunkt book article; the difference between what I submitted and what you made me turn it into was night and day.
