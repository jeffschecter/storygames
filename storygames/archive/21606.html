I've seen it framed as something to do when it "feels wrong" to a GM to make a decision about something; as an option to put it in someone else's hands, including an NPC's (!). What I'm trying to figure out is when we should expect to see those situations come up, and why we should expect a GM to respond to them in this matter.<br/><br/>"Sometimes" doesn't really cut it for me.<br/><br/>EDIT: Like, question-based GMing and having NPCs act based on their motivations rather than on narrative considerations makes sense to me, and I like to play that way. The thing that mystifies me is bait-and-switch psychological element to it. The "I didn't do that" element. Why is that necessary, and what makes it necessary?<br/><br/>EDIT 2: I've edited the title of the thread to reflect that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472580/#Comment_472580" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-20T20:10:28+00:00" title="April 20, 2018  8:10PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In some sense, I think that this is part of the "covenant" of agreeing to play games designed in the "System Matters" Forgite vein: if System really is going to Matter, then we have to agree to let it do things to us in order to churn out the intended effect. If the game is going to teach us what it's meant to teach us, make us feel what it's meant to make us feel, challenge us in the ways that its meant to challenge us, then we can't interfere with it doing its job.<br/><br/>I don't know how familiar you are with OSR, but for some people one of the most important pieces of game wisdom is to avoid interacting with the mechanics as much as possible. Characters, especially low-level ones, are squishy: low hit points, bad saves, few bonuses to dice rolls that are already usually not in their favor, and cetera.<br/><br/>When the dice do hit the table, it's (usually) the culmination of several decisions that came before that, and intervening to stop that would invalidate all those other choices that the players already made. If you aren't willing to accept the results that come from interacting with the mechanics, then there's no point in having them in the first place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vivificient" title="Vivificient"><img alt="Vivificient" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/869/nJT73EZCYKXZO.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vivificient">Vivificient</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472588/#Comment_472588" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-20T23:08:16+00:00" title="April 20, 2018 11:08PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Gloracle is a word minted here on S-G. "The glorious oracle of dice and prep"; part of the old school (or OSR) ethos is that once play has started, the DM should be a neutral referee and no longer a creator. If the text says "the statuette is in the third drawer from the top in the mahogany desk in the guest bedroom", that's where it is. No amount of searching in the kitchen can find the statuette. If the prep says that strangers have pocket contents from a particular random table, and the players pickpocket a stranger, well, that's what they get, a random roll from that table.

Try to do this <b>only</b> when your question touches on an obvious interest or expertise of the Protagonist, and <b>keep it specific</b>.<br/>\u201c<i>Wizard, how does magic work?</i>\u201d is a terrible question. Too big, too vague, too abstract. <br/>\u201c<i>Wizard, is magic immoral or illegal where you come from?</i>\u201d is much better. It\u2019s easy to answer, just a detail, but ripe with potential consequences.<br/>\u201c<i>Bard, have you ever been in this city before?</i>\u201d<br/>\u201c<i>Ranger, what plant grows in this region that can serve your purpose? How does it look like? Does it have a unique smell?</i>\u201d<br/><br/>2)<br/>When you need to <b>make decisions you don\u2019t want</b> to make yourself...<br/>...you can ask what to do to an NPC, or to the world, or to a Protagonist.<br/><br/>- Asking to an <b>NPC</b> means honestly asking yourself \u201cwhat would this NPC do in this situation?\u201d. Yes, you are still making the decision yourself, but this gives you a way to make it with integrity and to help you figure out what could <i><b>Make Sense</b></i>.<br/><br/>- Asking to <b>the world</b> means postponing the decision by turning it into an <i>Hourglass</i>. Hourglasses are explained in a later section but, in short, instead of having something happen here and now because you say so, you will add a bit of \u201csand\u201d whenever something relevant happens. Again, you are still making a decision, but this gives you a considered and concrete plan instead of just winging it, and it takes it off your hands in the immediate.<br/><br/>- Asking to the <b>Protagonists</b> means to ask them what they do about the thing you are deciding about. So don\u2019t ask \u201c<i>Will Samara live?</i>\u201d but ask instead \u201c<i>Samara is gravely wounded, <b>what to do you</b>?</i>\u201d. If they do nothing, she dies. If they somehow help, she lives. Be honest! After all, you wanted them to decide for you, why cheat?<br/><br/>3)<br/>When you need help figuring out <b>how to engage</b> the Protagonists, to have the world <b><i>Make Sense</i></b> for them, to have the events <b><i>Rock the Boat</i></b> for them...<br/>...ask a Protagonist for <b>immediate and intimate</b> details of their experience. Look at the Protagonists, where they are, what they are doing, who they meet, and ask them how they <b>feel</b> about it, what they <b>think</b> about it.<br/>Do they feel awe? Do they feel guilt? Do they think about the other person\u2019s perspective? Do they think themselves righteous and heroic? Why? How?<br/>Look at the Protagonists\u2019 <b>Keys</b> and compare them to their actions and words, then ask questions about what you see. By doing so you will stumble upon the things the Protagonists truly care about and are invested in.<br/><br/>But asking questions is only half of it. The other half is <b>putting the answers to good use</b>:<br/>- build on them, adding details and imagery of your own<br/>- use them to inform your own aesthetic, incorporating them and their implications into your own vision<br/>- refer to them later in play, bringing them back into currency<br/></blockquote>\nPS:<br/>In FW the Agendas and Principles are a bit different than in AW2. In particular the 3 Agendas are: Play to Find Out, Make Sense, Rock the Boat.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20Nicol" title="Jonathan Nicol"><img alt="Jonathan Nicol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20Nicol">Jonathan Nicol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472927/#Comment_472927" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-26T04:57:38+00:00" title="April 26, 2018  4:57AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's some great stuff Hasimir.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472935/#Comment_472935" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-26T07:35:15+00:00" title="April 26, 2018  7:35AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 26, 2018 7:37AM by Paul_T.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great stuff there (though much if it is just from the original AW text, which does a good job of explaining itself).<br/><br/>There are lots of little things in the game (and in many/most/all games!) which are not obvious on a cursory reading. Their impact as a rule or piece of advice you read doesn't reflect their actual impact on the game at the table.<br/><br/>For example, when I read about "stakes questions" in AW, they seemed kind of pointless. They have no mechanical weight or function, right? It's just like a little trick you play on yourself, for no obvious reason.<br/><br/>However, then I saw Adam Koebel prep for a game of AW (he does his prep in real time, with the camera running, in his GM game prep videos!) and I could see it doing something for him. I got curious about that.<br/><br/>I tried it in my own game. Much to my surprise, the impact was very significant! Writing these down would have a dramatic impact on how I would run and prep for the game; a written pledge of sorts to take my hands off a specific issue and to get excited about discovering it in play.<br/><br/>That sounds kind of empty, on paper, but committing to NOT deciding something is a powerful mental process, and then writing it down means that you're creating a cue for yourself to <i>look for opportunities in play</i> for this question to be answered. (And Hasimir's list is incredibly useful there in terms of how you might do that.)<br/><br/>It's curious and very interesting. I'm in the process of experimenting with it further.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
