A few years ago, I realized that I could turn that idea into an actual RPG with rules and structure. Now that we've entered what many would call the age of fake news, it seems only fitting to publish the result as a complete experience: <a href="https://zaprpg.com/" rel="nofollow">Zap</a>!<br/><br/>Reading the rules and example of play, do they entice you to try it out? What kind of scenarios sound the most exciting to portray in a format like this? Are there ways that Zap could capitalize even more on the whole fake news phenomenon? All feedback welcome.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469714/#Comment_469714" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-07T08:44:23+00:00" title="February  7, 2018  8:44AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very attractive by its looks and ... oh the titles ! <br/>I would not want to play it on my own initiative, because it's very much "actor stance"<br/>I would start easy with "paranormal mysteries", "early morning garden exploration".<br/>I picture it as a LARP. Low budget productions, stickers slapped on people jackets with their names, fake helicopter effects and all, probably cheap, vintage, out of norm accessories. <br/>Building collusion, professional rivalry and interfering romance over time.<br/>Infotainment is older than cellphone, it flows in the culture, I'd just rely on that.<br/><br/>I just got a new toy from Ron Edward's site, so I can share it with you : better than to outline the story in advance, begin by throwing in a few disconnected "facts, names, sound bites and pictures" as story fodder. There is a thread on the forum about items begging to be used in a game sometime. Using this kind of material opens to a whole fact checking dimension. Pervasivity is of the essence.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469716/#Comment_469716" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-07T09:34:30+00:00" title="February  7, 2018  9:34AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19511/things-begging-to-be-used-in-a-game-somewhere" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19511/things-begging-to-be-used-in-a-game-somewhere</a><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jakob" title="Jakob"><img alt="Jakob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jakob">Jakob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469723/#Comment_469723" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-07T14:51:58+00:00" title="February  7, 2018  2:51PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the idea of using it for campaigns rather than just one-shot play. One variant that I've considered, related to the idea of "facts, names, sound bites, and pictures" that you mention, is having just one or two players portray the same news anchors throughout an entire session. The other players would then act as the production team and give the anchors various cues on what should be covered next, in the same way that a teleprompter or earpiece does in reality. With this setup, it could even be possible for one or more "gamemasters" to prepare a mystery scenario that the anchor players would get to discover step by step.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rgrassi" title="rgrassi"><img alt="rgrassi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rgrassi">rgrassi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469725/#Comment_469725" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-07T15:21:43+00:00" title="February  7, 2018  3:21PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very very interesting and fun.
