Also, apologies again to E. T. Smith for derailing this thread, I did not mean it.<br/><br/>To mitigate this, I'll throw in some other uses for Index Cards:<br/><br/><i>Shock:</i> ICs can be used to track minutiae and keep them handy for later games, just rubber band the ICs together and keep them with your *Tagonists sheets and Shock/Issue grid.<br/><br/><i>1001 nights:</i> ICs seem to be a natural choice to jot down the Player's wagers/story ideas, with the Gems on them to roll.<br/><br/><i>SotC:</i> as mentioned, for Scene, Campaign and other Aspects. Not only to write them down, but also to visually cue when they are tagged: "tap" them, or flip them over, or place a token on them.<br/><br/><br/>General uses: <br/><br/><i>Minions and Villains:</i> if it can't fit on an IC it's probably overdone anyway <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> (in systems that let you write all the mechanical stuff in very little space, that is). This way you can keep track of who's in scene, mark off "casualties" on the edge of the card, and maybe even let players rip them in pieces when defeated (for that cathartic experience).<br/><br/><i>Abstract Map Pieces: </i> I kinda remember some Hipster PDA templates for mind mapping that would totally work for this, also: useful for SotC/Fate Zones, but also for RedBoxHack, and all those games that don't really require a grid-map, but will benefit from actually knowing where is something, on a "tactical" level. Each card can be a "place", with arrows connecting and pointing to other cards. The map will build naturally, and if you are careful you can rebuild it for the next session. On each of them, mark the most important stuff of that zone/place: people, features, mechanical modifiers.<br/><br/><br/>There, that was off the top of my head, I'm sure there's more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AnttiKi" title="AnttiKi"><img alt="AnttiKi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.veljeskunta.info/anttiki/antti4_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnttiKi">AnttiKi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182288/#Comment_182288" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T02:13:02+00:00" title="December  9, 2008  2:13AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, to make amends for joining in thread derailing, my contribution:<br/><br/>For playstorming / playtesting<br/><br/>Write possible player actions on index cards.

Then take an equal stack and everyone writes motivations and open-ended personal connections (hates the red card, suspects the blue card of eloping). Shuffle each stack, then randomly match one motive card to each character card. The GM collects the results and then the situation is played.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J%20B%20Bell" title="J B Bell"><img alt="J B Bell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J%20B%20Bell">J B Bell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182765/#Comment_182765" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-10T23:22:41+00:00" title="December 10, 2008 11:22PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Try a search for "A7 notecard"--this appears to be equivalent to the larger-size 4" x 6" "index" cards.

This way you can keep track of who's in scene, mark off "casualties" on the edge of the card, and maybe even let players rip them in pieces when defeated (for that cathartic experience).</blockquote>\nWell, I have used them with Dungeons and Dragons before, with satisfactory results.<br/><br/>In Mexico they are mostly known as "tarjetas bibliogr\xe1ficas".<br/><br/><br/>I have this cool trick I learned a few years back. It is called a Deck of Secrets.<br/><br/>I take one card and write one interesting/adventure-seeding secret about any important part of my game (a NPC, a villain, a place in the setting, an event). Then, next time I am thinking about what I'd use for tonight's game I shuffle those cards and randomly draw one or two. Then I somehow integrate them in the adventure. That way I get to tie the cool stuff with new stuff, in a way that allows me to organically work without ever needing to "script" everything. And the cool thing is since I'm only giving some clues, I get to use the same secret several times. That is, unless I decide to make my deck grow with every session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
