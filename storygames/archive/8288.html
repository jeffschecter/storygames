Joel shows up with "Land Galleons of the Wild West" and we go crazy as usual.  And of course we're playing a three session PTA game, which is something you aren't really supposed to do.  And it doesn't really work that well.  The characters and premise feel half-baked,  Screen presence is sorta messed up, it's just not hitting on all cylinders.  <br/><br/>So I ask you - between the very effective and time-tested 5 and 9 episode season and the functional if unsatisfying one shot, is there a way forward?  Are there techniques that could make this work, or are we just being somewhat dumb and breaking a perfectly functional game?  Or both?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182844/#Comment_182844" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-11T11:01:53+00:00" title="December 11, 2008 11:01AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I never tried this, so I don't know if it could work or not, but it's the first thing I though after reading your post.. maybe you could play 2 episodes every session, like two half-hour shows instead of one?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182845/#Comment_182845" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-11T11:05:35+00:00" title="December 11, 2008 11:05AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What specifically wasn't firing?<br/>What causes you to conclude that the number of sessions was a key contributing factor?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182860/#Comment_182860" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-11T11:35:13+00:00" title="December 11, 2008 11:35AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One problem was that there was no room for a pilot episode, so in the first session there was a PC in the spotlight.

Then at the beginning of those sessions you could do a "Previously On" segment where you collectively story board in key events from those missing episodes.  Thematically, this would be like the days before TIVO and FanCast where if you missed an episode of your favorite show, the best you could hope for was for friends to fill you in on what happened.<br/><br/>The story boarding could even be done by chat/email prior to the FtF session.<br/><br/>Does that sound functional?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182868/#Comment_182868" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-11T11:49:13+00:00" title="December 11, 2008 11:49AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Making screen presence the same is garbage.  At that point, you should just play vanilla Fudge.<br/><br/>PTA definitely needs some tweaking to do "multi-part TV special" instead of the TV series it's meant to model.  TV specials are basically like long movies and are pretty different from TV series in regards to pacing and how issues are resolved.  <br/><br/>Honestly, I think you'd be better off viewing it as "an excerpt of a long-running TV show," as if you sat down to watch part of a West Wing marathon, instead of trying to create something that was self-contained using the PTA rules.  I'd suggest just sitting down and saying, "Okay, we're halfway through Season 2.  Let's talk a little bit about what's happened so far..."<br/><br/>If you did that, I'd think it would be gold.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182870/#Comment_182870" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-11T11:52:36+00:00" title="December 11, 2008 11:52AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph, a couple of things:<br/><br/>Screen presence is a little cocked up, maybe because we decided to divide it equitably, 1-2-3.

Any way you slice it, you only get a handful of scenes to develop that confrontation, make it seem significant, and pay it off. It can be done. Sure, you might not get all the texture on that Issue that you would in a longer game, but I think you can still make it viscerally satisfying.<br/><br/>Man.
