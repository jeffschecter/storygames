I was just wondering if anybody else had the same thought, or if anybody had any suggestions on hacks to make it run more smoothly.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mr%20Sitouh" title="Mr Sitouh"><img alt="Mr Sitouh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mr%20Sitouh">Mr Sitouh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312772/#Comment_312772" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-15T19:33:07+00:00" title="February 15, 2011  7:33PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think if any changes were really necessary, I'd consider using stress tracks along the lines of what Rob Donoghue has to say here <a href="http://rdonoghue.blogspot.com/2010/12/stress-tracks-in-leverage.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> to darken things a little, increase the amount of consequences, and possibly having the basic die for the GM be a d8 instead of a d6 (again, an idea from Rob).<br/><br/>Together, those seem like they should help put things on a slightly more serious tone, especially once you make sure your players buy in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks" title="CamBanks"><img alt="CamBanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks">CamBanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312775/#Comment_312775" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-15T20:50:54+00:00" title="February 15, 2011  8:50PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are good suggestions, although the game runs fine without any changes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/worldnamer" title="worldnamer"><img alt="worldnamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/60/224926835_32ff7cf58d_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/worldnamer">worldnamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312788/#Comment_312788" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-16T00:19:47+00:00" title="February 16, 2011 12:19AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While I haven't had a chance to run Leverage yet (Next week! Very excited!) I do think the system doesn't lend itself to dark and gritty. YMMV, of course, and these are off-the-cuff impressions, but I rather read your question and thought "But why would you do that?"<br/><br/>That said, we're currently designing a game much along these lines, and have a mechanic awfully similar to the stress track design of Rob's. I think something like that really helps if you're going to run Leverage as a straight-up Heist. Also, I imagine that judicious use of timed actions would be essential.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
