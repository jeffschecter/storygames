(I don't often have those.)<br/><br/>I was with a group of people and we were trying to play Synnibarr (!!!).<br/><br/>There were hilarious problems throughout. First, the text insisted that only "characters of Eastern European origin" were acceptable.<br/><br/>Second, bizarre and nearly unplayable procedures. The one I remember was having to roll for the type of dice you were going to roll. We followed the procedure at one point and it told us that for this roll we had to use 5d9.<br/><br/>There was lots of laughter, and we decided to keep trying until we hit one of the moments in play when the game would ask us to integrate a function (some game rules used integration!).<br/><br/>We eventually did, and, true to our word, stopped playing there and all went home.<br/><br/>Sadly, I don't remember any of the fictional content of the game.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470016/#Comment_470016" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-15T17:47:21+00:00" title="February 15, 2018  5:47PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, wow.

It was my idea, actually - I checked out Ron's new site and got the idea that I should bring my mentor and mentee together, if I'm allowed such presumptuous titles [grin]. Both were interested, thinking that something useful might emerge, and we get to follow the process.<br/><br/>The main theme of the consultation is marketing Entropy better, which is a topic that Petteri's broached here a couple of times as well over the last year. The game's not gaining much traction, and while the reasons are not a great mystery (generic game, little active marketing), Petteri (and I as well) is interested in whether Ron might have any suggestions for improving that. They are, of course, starting by studying the game in depth to figure out what they're marketing.<br/><br/>I just watched that video (not a common occurrence for me) tonight. Pretty interesting stuff if you're as big into Entropy as I am (which I guess limits the audience just to me and Petteri, but hey...).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
