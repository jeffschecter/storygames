Next session we'll do board games and talking about what to play next, but just to prep I went to my shelf to look at:<br/><br/>What I was dying to run/play (Freemarket, Blood and Honor, Smallville).<br/>What games are on the equivalent of my "bucket list", and still occupy my shelf. Gotta play them at least once (or in some cases, once more; in those situations where it was just a one-shot).<br/><br/>Here's the stuff in that latter category, including the reasons I haven't jumped on them already. What's on yours?<br/><br/>Note that in a lot of these cases, most normal people would have no issues with them: But since I've got a carefully crafted (over years as a reactive/crisis system engineer/analyst) attention span of a fruit fly, I've got a hard time reading things that don't grab my soul and throttle it.<br/><br/>Dirty Secrets: It's on my Must Play pile! Unfortunately, just haven't dedicated the attention to get through the procedural text. For some reason it's not grabbing me. And that's more of a layout thing than a text thing, Seth Ben-Ezra is otherwise good at explaining rules/game, as evidenced by Legends of Alyria.<br/><br/>Legends of Alyria: I've run three one-shots of it in years past, I think it's time for a multi-session mini-campaign. The world is too juicy not to explore at least one more time.<br/><br/>Nine Worlds: Played it before as "the ruleset to an Exalted-set game" as a one-shot, but I kinda want to go back and run it a little longer. Only problem is that there's a lot of handling time in the rules, and a lot of "I have a hand of cards. But the session is over. Do I save this hand of cards and record them somewhere, or just draw new cards next session?" styles of questions.<br/><br/>Jaws of the Six Serpents: Great light fantasy game with some cool details for the setting and magic rules. Played it once as a one-shot, again time to revisit it as a multi-session game.<br/><br/>Solipsist: This game remains in an extremely unique position on a knife's edge: The fact that I really want to play a game seeped in "Mage: The Ascension"-style "what you think/believe changes Reality" game, vs the actual sitting down to play. Meh, the rules are just 30 f'ing pages at a glance, maybe it's just time I man up and get through it. :-)<br/><br/>Love in the Time of Seid: A solid one-shot game. Played it, love it, time to play it again. <br/><br/>Colonial Gothic: Mediocre system that doesn't suck, and has some cool quirks! And while I totally want to dig in and run this A Whopping Lot, the setting text (a majority of the book) makes it clear that I need to do a lot of reading here so I know what the setting (that is, historical colonial America) is like as a GM for proper description. That "lot of reading" means it has taken a back-burner for a while, even though I've bought it, the revised Rulebook, and the Gazetteer...<br/><br/>So, those are the games that are on my back-burner, not exactly clamoring for my attention with air horns and bells (Freemarket, etc) and yet games that I want to get to at some point. What's yours?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343636/#Comment_343636" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-22T15:52:08+00:00" title="September 22, 2011  3:52PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Games Actually Sitting on My Shelf That I Keep NOT Playing (But Want To!)</b><br/><br/>Poison'd<br/>Dust Devils<br/>Montsegur 1244<br/>Ganakagok                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JLHBurnett" title="JLHBurnett"><img alt="JLHBurnett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/722/nB1X4KGH4YFEW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JLHBurnett">JLHBurnett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343664/#Comment_343664" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-22T19:02:45+00:00" title="September 22, 2011  7:02PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Houses of the Blooded (I got to play it twice.

I'm gonna make a strong effort to get this played at IndieCon - a plasticine seagull plus artfully placed condom should garner some interest - and so hopefully this'll see the light of play.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cheers<br/>\nPete</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/asurber" title="asurber"><img alt="asurber" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/asurber">asurber</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343726/#Comment_343726" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-23T09:23:45+00:00" title="September 23, 2011  9:23AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The follow are at the top of my list:<br/><br/>Poison'd<br/>Game looks awesome, I can't want to see it in action. <br/><br/>Dungeon world<br/><br/>Remember Tomorrow<br/><br/>Capes<br/><br/>Burning Empires<br/><br/>Microscope:  hoping to play this tonight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343880/#Comment_343880" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-24T17:24:58+00:00" title="September 24, 2011  5:24PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The games sitting on my shelf unplayed are <b>The Drifter's Escape</b> and <b>Silver &amp; White</b>.

It practically runs itself. My only suggestion is to come up with a few notable locations/events ahead of time, try to work them into the game to see how the players react. When I run the game by default as a Western, I usually have a mean, dumb gunslinger guy with mismatched clothes (too-tight pants, too-loose shirt) come into a bar and get in one of the PC's faces, or else draw on someone innocent (piano player for playing a song that he doesn't like). When I run it as a samurai game, there's usually a few kabukimono gangers beating up on some vegetable-carting farmers at a crossroads next to a series of rice fields.<br/><br/>* Montsegur 1244<br/>-- I've only played it twice, but man: Powerful! I was even apprehensive of it, thinking it was "trying too hard" or whatever to evoke story, but I quickly got into it, really felt in the skin of the characters. Hard choices, roleplaying flows naturally, and even though there's a tragic end a'coming, the ride is great!<br/><br/>* In a Wicked Age<br/>-- One of my favorite games! The multi-"generational" feature really makes for a cool game, make sure you go through at least three or so generations/iterations for the full effect, but of course more is even better!<br/><br/>* Primetime Adventures<br/>-- It's so light that you might be worried about having enough game to play, but it's not the case! I've played everything from one shots with "serious" players to long campaigns with light roleplayers: It's great fun!<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343947/#Comment_343947" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-25T14:39:08+00:00" title="September 25, 2011  2:39PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the spirit of pimping unplayed games:<br/><br/><b>Mouse Guard:</b> You should play Mouse Guard! The characters are all tough and well-rounded, so you can always try cool stuff in the game, but they are also always faced with challenges worthy of bad-ass mice with swords. The many-layered subsystems of Burning Wheel are pretty much reduced to a single, flexible, elegant core mechanic that is also fun to play with, and can be used to resolve any kind of conflict (arguments, fights, chases, etc).<br/><br/>Also, I got to play Mouse Guard last night using the kewl new box set. The custom cards and dice make things even simpler. If you don't already have the books, and want to pick this game up, you should try to score the boxed set.<br/><br/><b>Fiasco:</b> You should play Fiasco! I have never once played a game and not laughed at least 100 times. Plus, it takes 2-3 hours, which is a hugely undervalued strength of an RPG. Also plus, you can play this game with anyone at all - hippie gamers, old-school D&amp;D dudes, your roommate's girlfriend - and they will have a great time. Guaranteed!<br/><br/><b>In A Wicked Age:</b> You should play In A Wicked Age! There is no game I know of that makes it easier and more painless to introduce all kinds of new-school gaming ideas and techniques to a new gamer or old-school gamer. IAWA is also the best player-vs-player game I've ever played; the characters mostly end up going right at each other in a variety of epic and terrible manners, but in a way that makes the game more fun, not awkward or competitive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343997/#Comment_343997" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-26T07:26:09+00:00" title="September 26, 2011  7:26AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 26, 2011 7:26AM by thadrine.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Never played</b><br/>Cold City<br/>Song of Ice and Fire<br/>Polaris<br/>Yesterdays Tomorrows<br/>Over the Edge<br/>In a Wicked Age<br/>Poisn'd<br/>Swashbucklers of the 7 Skies<br/>Dust Devils<br/>Sorcerer<br/><br/><b>Games I have played once, but would like to do a campaign of</b><br/>Remember Tomorrow <br/>Legend of the Five Rings<br/>Houses of the Blooded<br/>Apocalypse World / Dungeon World<br/>Primetime Adventures<br/>Burning Wheel<br/>Danger Patrol<br/>Lady Blackbird<br/><br/>I actually got through about half of my list over the last year, I need to stop buying games for a while.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P" title="Adrian P"><img alt="Adrian P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P">Adrian P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344058/#Comment_344058" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-26T17:35:11+00:00" title="September 26, 2011  5:35PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hot War and/or Cold City: Played and run a couple of times, but not nearly enough.<br/><br/>Legends of Anglerre: Seems like a perfect fit for a game I've wanted to run, but the it may be a little high on the crunchy side for me to ever get round to playing.
