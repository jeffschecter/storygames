                    In planning revisions to some of my game chef submissions, I've been hitting a design question which I'm somewhat wary about. One of the key ideas design criteria behind most of the games was to construct a multiplicity of meanings. Essentially to ensure that a broad space exists for interpretation of the game, while the underlying dynamics remained largely unified. <br/>
<br/>
The key problem with that design goal is the need to ensure that the game does not inadvertently tell the reader how to play, and at the same time communicates that this freedom is intentional, removing interpretative authority from the text, while retaining dynamic influence of play. <br/>
<br/>
The first possible solution seems to be careful explainations, but I fear that these are limited by the need for examples. In that view I've considered multiple distinct, and ideally contradictory examples of play. In essence these would map out the potential space of the game. The third possible solution is building into the design a sort of during play synchronization of interpretation. I figure some combination of these might suffice. How ever, I am curious if there might be other options I have not considered. <br/>
<br/>
Ultimately I'm not sure if it is possible to entirely remove the RPG text's authority in interpreting the dynamics of play. But, I believe it is worth trying.<br/>

That way each group/player can interpret it in a way that best meets their goals.  Is that right?<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            You can also just be very minimal, and not really give 'instructions' at all. This probably won't be intimidating to most RPers. In fact, you'd have lots of company, since most games don't give much explicit instruction, and do 'allow' each group to do things their own way.                        </div>

In the sense of goals as being value judgements of play, you're largely correct. The key idea is to make the RPG text expressly silent on the value of a particular state during play. The intent is not so much to encourage flexibility to but to facilitate communication and comprehension of these very values by each player's behavior. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Jasper,<br/>
<br/>
Most RPGs are not silent on the value of different game states and dynamics, although they may not be consistent. The difference is I want to design these games to be expressly silent, so they cannot be turned into a source of authority on the matter. Indeed, minimal values assignments are often the worst case, since they inspire the conflicts in which their authority is used.<br/>

                            I may be missing something.  Why not just be as clear as possible with the explanation of how the rules work, provide a number of different examples of how the rules could be applied, and then just tell the good users the rationale behind the diversity of examples?  Something like: <br/>
<br/>
"These rules allow and encourage users to play the game in a number of different ways.  To help you, the player, grasp this flexibility, I have provided several examples of play that use *different* interpretations of the rules.  They are not an exhaustive list of variations, merely exemplars to fuel your own experimentation."                        </div>

...is probably the best. In your exampels, chart out the ins and outs of the game, and in sidebars and the like really show off the limits and possibilities of the game.  That sounds like the best way to get the most out of your game.<br/><br/>Personally, I don't think enough people give these "limit examples", and because of that it's hard to get the real treasure out of the game text; rather it comes out when great people play and post their play results.  I've been bummed once or twice on a game only to find that when I read someone's play report I see that they're using the rules in ways that were pretty dynamic, but not clearly explained in the text.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Fair enough. Examples it is then.<br/>
<br/>
Just to make things more concrete, take Escape from Prince Charming. The idea would be a space of play examples, showing groups who have placed vastly different priorities on the trick taking mechanic. So you'd have an example of highly cooperative narration (with extensive table talk), competative narration (with strict no table talk), one where players are focused on narrating when they want, another where players focus on narrating how they want, and lastly one where they focus on getting their desired outcomes. Those five or so example would map out a broad space of ways to encounter the basic structure of the game, and suggest how the player values can be communicated before and during game (the values will likely change too much to work them all out prior to play).<br/>
<br/>
I suspect I need to approach Someone to Love and One More Hour in much the same way. Oh So Little Death, I'm less certain if examples will help. The problem there is not encouraging players to apply their own values, but enabling those values to be more safely communicated. Marraige of Persephone is the most traditional of the five in that sense, since the favor system strongly suggests which play states are preferred. <br/>

In fixed forms, it's all very well and good to talk about multiplicity of meaning and re-interpretation.<br/>
<br/>
What you're missing is that RPG in practice already has this in spades.  There's no reason for multiplicity of textual meaning because there is enormous, vast multiplicity of meaning in terms of play.<br/>
<br/>
The same group of people could play Shab al-Hiri Roach, exactly as it is written, thousands of times, and each time it would be a unique story with unique meaning.<br/>
<br/>
You're looking at the wrong thing -- it's like, you're saying "I want a hammer that can also be an airplane."  Hammers and airplanes are very "open" things.  You can do a lot with them -- with a hammer you can make many things, with an airplane you can go many places.  And thus, there is not need for flexibility in what it is, because what it does is so deeply, deeply flexible.<br/>

You are misapprehending. I am talking about making the text unambiguously uninvolved in disambiguating value judgements of different states and dynamics during play. This is explicitly reducing multiplicity for the text in favor of multiplicity during play. <br/>
<br/>
I think you are also saying that it's wrong to increase the scope of the multiplicity during play, which I assume is the the point of your airplane/hammer analogy. Much of current indie design focuses on reducing the scope of multiplicity in both the text and play. What I'm trying to do here is increase the scope of multiplicity for play by decreasing it in the text. I must admit I'm curious as to why you'd oppose that goal.<br/>

If for nothing other than the amusing challenge of it, could you restate your premise in simple English?  I suspect that you may be inadvertantly injecting multiplicity of interpretation of your primal missive, thereby sublating the utility of response and magnifying divergence from purpose of dependant postings.  By way of immediate example, let me apply the same imperitive to this present suggestion:<br/>

Each game book is of use in play. One in play may tell the rest in play what is true by the book. True in the way of to die is bad. True in the way of to kill the bad is good. True in the way of to use a good word is good. But, the book can say true and not true, at once.  I want the book to say that it does not say true or not true, only what is to be done. True is left to those who play. One in play may tell the rest what is true, but not by the book. <br/>
<br/>
Ben said I want the book to say true and not true very much, this is bad. He said that play is good when true and not true is said very much. But I said the same.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, I ask him if he does not want play to say true and not true more. I want the book to say it does not say true or not true. Not a book where it says just true. But my book will have play say true and not true much more. Is this good or bad to you?<br/>

<p>Consider this game:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a currency of tokens. Each token you have can be used to move a fictional object around, to a degree inversely proportional to the number of tokens you have.</li>
<li>Each player can do one of three actions (create an X, destroy an X, prevent destruction of an X), and as a result their currency is either doubled, halved, or redistributed around the table.</li>
</ul>
<p>So there is an economy and a system at work here of working with the fiction, and it has specific effects it is trying to encourage. (ex: One who creates many objects will have an inflated currency, but also a weakened ability to move things around.) And yet, this really says nearly nothing, maybe even absolutely nothing, about the meaning that players will derive from their working with the fiction. (Maybe the object they create is "a healthy romantic relationship". Maybe the object is "deadly weapon".) And in my text, I could come out an explicitly say that there is no value, in itself, to having currency or altering objects.</p>
<p>Is this an example of a game that qualifies?</p>

Since this is as much a game writting question as a design question, I don't see why the game you suggest couldn't be written that way. Indeed, there's no need to keep X abstract, you can specify them and still keep the text from being used to enforce a particular value judgement of them.<br/>

This is a bit more complicated than a game that does it well or not. Especially because there are two different ways for a text to fail to be explicitly silent: by being quiet but interpretable as vocal, by being explicitly vocal. The point is, I'm trying to make a text that is silent about the value of play states and dynamics, and unambigous about that silence. <br/>
<br/>
Most RPGs are a mixture of all of the above.<br/>
<br/>
Take a look at Dogs in the Vineyards:<br/>
<br/>
Dice on a character sheet - the text is pretty close to being explicitly silent on this, not valuing the presence or absence of dice.<br/>
<br/>
"Say yes or roll the dice" - the text is quiet on this, but not explicitly so. This causes ambiguity as to when you shouldn't say yes: importance to youself, importance to the players as a whole, potential for a fun conflict, significant in some objective sense.<br/>
<br/>
Being Dead - Since being dead puts you out of play, the text is pretty clearly judging this as negative.<br/>
<br/>
It is quite possible that no text can be explicitly silent on everything during the game, but I want to increase that expanse of play for which that is the case. I am very interested in communication, and I want to reduce or at least confine the influence of the text on the connotations of that communication. <br/>
<br/>
This is a difficult task, and it is a subtle distinction, but I believe that it is an important step in expanding the potential of RPGs.<br/>

<p>I think in <em>Dogs</em>, some of the most important value judgements - Is this just? Is this fair? Is my character a good person? - definitely happen entirely at the table, with some but not much influence from the text.</p>
<p>So as to removing that influence from your own text, clearly stating your intentions and some clear and contradictory examaples could both help. There are two things that could still be tricky, though.</p>
<p>Firstly, default meanings. Being dead, for example, is almost always a bad thing, especially in protagonist-centered fiction; if your text doesn't say anything one way or another about character death, is it implicitly accepting the value judgement that being dead is a playstate to be avoided? So the game needs to consider what fiction elements have a really strong default, and whether it's important to explicitly justify the alternative.</p>
<p>Secondly, emergent meanings. Regardless of what the text says, your mechanics have very strong power to reward play. If the player who gets the most in-game currency is the one who has the most fun/impact/attention, then even if you say "don't feel compelled to have or lack tokens" the players will tend towards certain interpretations of play. So I think you need to judge each rule, and determine if its effects are desirable; if not, you need to make sure that all the choices are ones that empower the players, so that they don't feel obligated to use a certain one to enjoy their game.</p>

You want a game text that describe a ruleset and a subject matter for a game without making any value judgements about the subject matter or actions that characters within the game might take.  The challenge you see is that the ruleset itself might make value judgements about the subject matter.<br/>
<br/>
Accurate?  If not, why not?<br/>

If that's right, I suspect you've constructed a paradox: I'm not sure I see how a ruleset can completely avoid value judgements and still be useful.                        </div>

Adam, I've got something in mind (basically editing my Deja Vu game), but I don't think that writing a game like this shorter is that much easier. <br/>
<br/>
Dev and Judson, "default" meanings are quite important, those are the main thing I see as needing to be eliminated in the design step, these are the game states I've been talking about. As far as emergent meanings, that's not as strong a concern. Textual value judegments come either from referencing dynamics themselves or from the way those dynamics affect the "default" meanings. If we remove the later, emergent values will be largely subsumed by player introduced values. Achieving this fully is probably impossible, but making this a conscious design goal is important anyway.<br/>

                            Okay: two issues.<br/>
<br/>
First, even if you can somehow excise "death is bad" from the text, for there to be an actual game, I don't see how the rules can not reward or punish certain kinds of behavior or states of being.  As soon as you do that, you're essentially coding philosophic values into the game.  Certainly, players will bring their own values, but they'll be examined in contrast to the implicit or explicit values of the game.<br/>
<br/>
Second, _that's a good thing._  What you're describing seems isomorphic a card printed "Describe your beliefs."  And one of the best tools for examining and exercising our values to challenge them.  And the players will certainly challenge each other, but as an aspect of design, a designer gets to challenge them as well.                        </div>

<br/>
You underestimate the relationship between values of game states and values of game dynamics. Since game dynamics move between game states, if certain dynamics are more or less valued, then the dynamics will acquire value by that same means. But at the same time, if certain dynamics are valued over others, the states will have an induced value structure. You can't eliminate that link. The point being that a game text that clearly imparts that there are no inherent values to game states (such as death) will impart that same to the dynamics.<br/>
<br/>
Certainly as you play the game you will find some states more valuable than others. But this is fundamentally emergent, it is not a value derived from the text, rather our search for structure in play. I don't want to reduce that form of emergence, indeed, I want it to be as viable as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Also, at no point have I been saying that designer embedded values cannot be good things. I'm simply saying that they are not always good things, depending on your design goals. Challenging is one way to do things, but it is hardly the only way to foster communication and allow internal beliefs to emerge. <br/>
