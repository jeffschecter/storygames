This is a great opportunity for him to impress them to get their trust. <br/><br/>I was thinking of this as a move, any considerations?<br/><br/>If you go hunting with Slicers Gang roll+hard (no shit driver does apply here i think)<br/>On a 10+ choose 3, on a 7-9 choose 2 <br/>*Your car is undamaged<br/>*You hunt enough food for the hardhold <br/>*You impress the Gang<br/>*You get back safely <br/>On a miss you are caught in a bad spot.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonB" title="JonB"><img alt="JonB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonB">JonB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385896/#Comment_385896" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-27T14:04:55+00:00" title="July 27, 2012  2:04PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On a miss you are caught in a bad spot, but choose one anyways. The others are all <i>totally</i> converse.<br/><br/>This way, the player could, for example:<br/><br/>Make it back safely! But his car is trashed, nobody's eating this week, and Slicer's gang thinks he's a lowlife.<br/><br/>Hands over a little more authorship for the player and gives an idea of what the next scene frame should be, no?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
