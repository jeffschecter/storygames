Or make a character as you play.<br/><br/>I've joined Jeepform games where you're encouraged to play "close to home", using your character as an excuse to just play yourself. Or to play a character but draw their emotions from your own life similar to method acting.<br/><br/>For many people, character is needed separation. It creates a safe space to explore potentially unsafe ideas. Viola calls character something to hide or withdraw behind. I think character is a shield, something that makes you feel safe as you charge forward. <br/><br/>Character is also a creative constraint that inspires play. Sometimes playing without a character is akin to staring at a blank page and expecting to write something brilliant.  Character may also help keep games from getting too personal and becoming a pseudo therapy session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327012/#Comment_327012" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-31T06:20:28+00:00" title="May 31, 2011  6:20AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Character isn't just for people. Character is also used for settings. <br/><br/>People may want to play in a civil war but don't want to actually use material directly from the real world. So they dress a historical setting in a character, often fantasy and scifi. Same thing with racism. I've seen people play intense fantasy games dealing with serious issues of racism with no hesitation. But they won't play those same situations without a character placed over that situation. <br/><br/>Jason, I believe both you and I would be happy to play out these intense situations without character at all. I'd play games where I was playing myself teleported into various times in history dealing with serious issues. But I suspect most people wouldn't want to play that.<br/><br/>In some RPGs, especially tactical games, character is less a role to roleplay and more of an avatar to manipulate. I know a lot of hardcore D&amp;D players who don't care about character. A friend said, "this is me just playing me except I'm dressed up as a Dragonborn with cool powers." It's more "dress up" than "roleplaying." But I've noticed those same players don't engage too often in the emotional side of roleplaying situations. When focusing on tactics, character as "safe place to explore unsafe ideas" isn't as relevant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327013/#Comment_327013" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-31T06:22:49+00:00" title="May 31, 2011  6:22AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great points, John! Many of these definitions can be reframed positively. One person's withdrawal is another person's safety zone, as you say.<br/><br/>One dismissive tidbit that really piques my interest is "artificial imposition of character on self as opposed to allowing natural growth to evolve out of relationship".  The normal route to character is through strong artificial mediation - you <i>build </i>a character, often through complex processes, before you play and explore. I'd argue that even a game like Fiasco, which puts heavy emphasis on relationship and situation before character creation, still has this strong artificial mediation. Even in a high-bleed Jeepform game, you are likely assigned a character with some initial backstory and baggage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327015/#Comment_327015" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-31T06:36:40+00:00" title="May 31, 2011  6:36AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2011 6:37AM by jenskot.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My favorite part of Dogs in the Vineyard is when you assign unassigned Relationship dice in play. 2d6... that's my cousin who stole from my family! <br/><br/>We've started doing the same with Traits.

We're also taught to avoid much in the way of endowing our partners with plot/backstory qualities so as to avoid interfering with their ability to do the same. We train for and specialize in longer, narrative pieces - single stories lasting anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour and a half - and as our artistic director puts it, "Some nights you just don't have the energy to be President. So if someone goes and <i>makes</i> you the President, that's a problem."<br/><br/>This seems like a different approach than gets taken by people trained in other schools, going by people I meet and troupes I see at festivals anyway. And the direct applicability to roleplaying games as such is a vexed and vexing question! But one practical outcome is, I'm always wanting to start <i>playing</i> a Fiasco session before anyone else is. &lt;g&gt;<br/><br/><br/>Jim                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327044/#Comment_327044" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-31T10:11:03+00:00" title="May 31, 2011 10:11AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I was trained up in the Chicago style where aggressive endowment is seen as a gift and 20 minutes is a harrowing ordeal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327047/#Comment_327047" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-31T10:32:51+00:00" title="May 31, 2011 10:32AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2011 10:33AM by David_Berg.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find that getting multiple players rolling on establishing and communicating a shared fiction is only possible with a certain amount of grounding.  Where and when are we imagining the action?  How do we produce it (what are our standards)?  Who are we?  Letting "who are we" start out undefined sounds like a major hurdle to forming a shared fiction.  I'm not saying it can't be overcome, but I suspect specific techniques for that purpose would be required.<br/><br/>If I'm having my character <i>do</i> things, and I have no grounding in an idea of who they are or what they want, then either I'm playing a dude with amnesia or I'm staying in strict author-storyteller stance, in which case my emotional reactions are filtered through that perspective.  Accordingly, I'd assume that "what would be an interesting action here" would be a more natural response than "what would I do here".  For "what would I do here", I need to already know a bit about who I am.<br/><br/>If I'm <i>not</i> having my character do things, though, it could be neat to develop them in my head in response to other fictional goings-on...<br/><br/>I feel like I'm probably missing some options here, but I'm having trouble envisioning how alternatives could possibly play out.  So please educate me!<br/><br/>Note: An early version of Delve char-gen had a roll-on table for what happened in each year of your life (inspired by Cyberpunk 2020), with the twist that you'd then narrate your reaction to these events.  How you responded to your troubles would construct the evolution of your personality, giving you a good sense of who your character was and is by the end of the process.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327111/#Comment_327111" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-31T14:23:15+00:00" title="May 31, 2011  2:23PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a thing I've noticed where sometimes people are more interested in "displaying" their character than they are in "experiencing" their character.<br/><br/>What I mean is that some people, sometimes, come to the table with a fully-formed idea of who their character is, and then their in-play decisions are based on what would best reveal that character to the other players.

I just played a game of Lady Blackbird last Monday (best way to inaugurate the summer!), and I was thinking about exactly this issue. This difference in play style has been, in my experience, often one of the single most important things to get everyone on the same page about, since Character Before games tend to have a very different feel than Character Now games-- they often coincide with a style of game play centered around characters colliding and pushing against each other to get what they want (which has been, to a certain extent, predetermined), versus a game with an exploratory tone (not just exploration of a setting, but also of the characters! Mutual exploration!).<br/><br/>Interestingly, in my own personal experience the former (Character Before) has actually been an acquired taste-- the overwhelming majority of newbies go straight for Character Now (influenced heavily by their own character/what they think would be totally badass). Character Before play requires a fair amount of discipline and concentration to stay focused on the "fully-formed" character idea without drifting too much in the moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327184/#Comment_327184" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-31T20:48:15+00:00" title="May 31, 2011  8:48PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2011 8:48PM by Simon_C.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Stephen P</cite><br/>Interestingly, in my own personal experience the former (Character Before) has actually been an acquired taste-- the overwhelming majority of newbies go straight for Character Now (influenced heavily by their own character/what they think would be totally badass).
