They will drop rules they don't understand, change the scenario to make it more fun for their group, add monsters and tasks... you name it. <br/><br/>How much play experience do they need to do this? About three minutes. Let me give you an example.<br/><br/>A few weeks ago, I ran a game for eight teachers. After that, they ran the game for their students. I know for a fact that most of them had <i>no</i> previous experience. They were, in fact, pretty scared by the whole thing, and didn't know whether they could handle it. <br/><br/>While they were running the game, I went from classroom to classroom observing what happened. In one class the teacher decided she'd rather use her own notes than the book we'd given her; she explained the game in her own terms, adding and subtracting stuff on the fly. It almost turned into a LARP there - she was dressing up; at the end of the day, she gave her students an assignment: "Bring clothes that fit your character, and you'll score some points!" One of the girls came back the next day with a dress she'd made herself... wow.<br/><br/>Another teacher decided we hadn't made the monsters strong enough, so he doubled their dice to give his students more of a challenge.<br/><br/>A third one added a sub-plot about the queen's courtship with a foreign noble, and made the students help her write love letters in English.<br/><br/>Now, teachers are, of course, teachers. They'll take control and change things, because they're kings and queens of their classrooms, and that's how it should be. But still: These were people with no gaming experience, and they started rewriting the book from the beginning - scenario, game system, tasks, you name it. This leads me to think that many people don't need to be told they have the freedom to change the game - they take that freedom for granted. It's just us inhibited and pedantic rules lawyer types that sometimes have a hard time saying "yeah, whatever" and just doing what feels right.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Georgios" title="Georgios"><img alt="Georgios" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Georgios">Georgios</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146803/#Comment_146803" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-30T02:04:14+00:00" title="May 30, 2008  2:04AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think, people will change the game, if they know what they want from it or recognise where their enjoyment comes from.<br/><br/>As long as I don't know, I'll follow rules, suggestions and conventions until I do find something I want/enjoy or give up and do something else.

Textbooks, outlines, techniques that other teachers use, and all sorts of resources are just tools to help them with their real goal - having their students learn. It sounds like these teachers of yours saw roleplaying as exactly that - another tool for the classroom. They already have their own techniques, and they know their students, so they naturally adapt rpg for their own uses.<br><br>"Playing by the rules" is a maxim from the board game end of the gaming spectrum. When most people sit down to play Clue or Hungry Hippos, they agree to play by the rules as written. Players from the "play pretend," improv or storytelling end of the spectrum are more likely to fiddle with the rules at will.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jacob" title="Jacob"><img alt="Jacob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jacob">Jacob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146844/#Comment_146844" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-30T06:57:02+00:00" title="May 30, 2008  6:57AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Slightly off topic, but what kind of awesome school is this?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146846/#Comment_146846" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-30T07:26:38+00:00" title="May 30, 2008  7:26AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A Norwegian school - Grimstad Ungdomsskole.

I love stuff like this. I love seeing nongamers "get it" and take it and make it even better.<br/><br/>I think there's a difference -- perhaps only a subtle one, I dunno -- between changes people make to make a game playable at all and changes people make to make a game even better. The first kind of change is like buying a car with a broken engine or no tires. You expect you'll have to put some time and sweat and grease into the thing to make it work at all. The second kind of change is like buying a car that works fine, but then boring out the engine, adding on a supercharger and a nitrous system, upgrading with ceramic breaks and a new suspension system, and customizing the body with fins and stripes. It's a much better car for you now, cuz you wanted a racer. Some other person might have bought the same car and had the interior ripped out and replaced with leather seats and a high end audio package.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146861/#Comment_146861" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-30T08:57:57+00:00" title="May 30, 2008  8:57AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow!
