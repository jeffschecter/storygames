So you can fit Savage Worlds into most genres, but it's difficult to do things like make a character who is a blog or has six legs.  You have a GM who leads the players through adventures.  There are no mechanics that allow players to control the narration beyond their in-game player actions.<br/><br/>What makes it neat is that the game elements are really fun to play.  The playing cards as initiative, the bennies, the multiple dice and the exploding die all make the gameplay element a fun part of the actual game alongside the roleplaying.<br/><br/>Starting to feel tempted to come on over to the dark side, Robert?  Thinking about maybe breaking down some silos?

It definitely lives up to its billing as fast and easy, without being ridiculously simple.<br/><br/>I don't really think it's that fun though. I guess it doesn't fit my personal preferences anywhere. It doesn't have a lot of the mechanics that my favorite games have (see also: Forge-derived), but it also doesn't really do it for me as far as "trad" rules go. It doesn't have the elegance of 'Storming the Wizard's Tower', the precision detailing of GURPS, or the polish, feel and history of D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Based on my games of SW, it seems like a perfect game engine to use when you want a game whose rules you can ignore when the mood strikes you, without really impacting anything too much.*<br/><br/>* Which is what some people dig, and more power to

clue, or generally advances the plot.

So it makes sense that the crucial guideline is the quantity given out rather than how they are distributed.<br/><br/>Savage Worlds is an interesting game and I have to say I disagree with Brian Minters assertion that "it seems like a perfect game engine to use when you want a game whose rules you can ignore when the mood strikes you, without really impacting anything too much."  Most experienced Savage Worlds players will tell you that you should really play the game following the rules.  They also say that the game text of SWEX is quite precise and tight. Nothing is repeated and a situation that may be unclear can be resolved by reading a single line, which people may have skimmed over because they are used to rules being emphasized and repeated in other games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266695/#Comment_266695" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T12:32:43+00:00" title="April 12, 2010 12:32PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 12, 2010 12:33PM by John_Harper.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like Savage Worlds.

This is definitely not the case with Savage Worlds.  A combat with 2 players is going to be less complex and thus perhaps slightly less interesting, but it certainly won't fall apart.  One of the innovations that really makes Savage Worlds a step above other generic systems for me is the initiative system, which uses a deck of cards.  You draw each round, so initiative changes constantly and you never get into the repetitive, cyclical rut of GURPS or D20.  A Joker allows the player to draw it to move at any moment (even interrupting) and gets a +2 on everything.  That is one of those arbitrary rules that sacrifices simulation and annoys some types of players when they read about it, but in play it is a blast.  Often, the Joker seems to pop up just when you need it the most or in front of the GM just when you don't want him to have it the most.  The dealing of initiative often leads to a lot of hoorays or groans, which is a sign that people are having a good time.<br/><br/>You lose some of that with only two players, but there still is plenty of room for the other tactical techniques.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of Barbarians of Lemuria, but it really has zero tactics in its mechanics.  If you are looking for something to play with minis where you want a bit of decision-making with the rules and engagement with the mechanics but that isn't too complex, then I'd say Savage Worlds could be a strong contender.  The Explorers Edition is also only $10 and it is the complete rule set (another super smart marketing move by Pinnacle).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ola%20J." title="Ola J."><img alt="Ola J." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ola%20J.">Ola J.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266705/#Comment_266705" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T13:01:16+00:00" title="April 12, 2010  1:01PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As people have said, it's not forge-derived in any way, but the way I understand it the design-process was informed by some of the same grievances that the forge had with traditional gaming ("why is it only fun for 20 minutes out of every 4 hours" for instance). But where the forge went the way of theory, experiments and radical new designs, Shane Hensley used an entirely traditional setup but stripped it of everything that he didn't see as necessary, and tried to make sure all the sub-systems were fun to use in and of themselves. And he made a pretty good game, in my opinion. <br/><br/>(However - the main attraction for me, personally, with SW, is the Plot Point-campaigns; a fairly skeletal setting and a bare-bones campaign in one slim book, giving me clear but not overly-detailed frame for my own ideas and improvisations, a setup that works incredibly well for my style of gamesmastering.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266706/#Comment_266706" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T13:02:48+00:00" title="April 12, 2010  1:02PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 12, 2010 1:06PM by John_Harper.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep, what walkerp said.

So if I were going to play, I'd make the terms for getting bennies more concrete, eliminate "random" PC death and maybe work a little protracted "abstract conflict" in as a variant of the wound rules.<br/><br/>Also, while it says that a "good" player might get 3-5 bennies in a night, I really feel like there should be like twice that.

There is a lot of space for roleplaying where there aren't any rules but for everything that there are rules, I'd agree with Johnzo that it is pretty much undriftable and there is no reason to drift if you want to play some fast-paced tactical action cinematic roleplaying.

Do you need to set them up for every combat or just the big complicated ones?</blockquote>\nI guess you wouldn't really need figs for a one-on-one swordfight in a  featureless room, where you've got only one range to track and no terrain to deal with. I'd want figs for anything larger, where teamwork, cover, mission objectives, etc, were at issue. <br/><br/>(edit) Also, many PC edges are directly about what happens on the map.  Say I chose an edge for my character that increased their running die to a d8.  (this is the die I roll for extra inches of movement when my dude is running, and for normal characters it's a d6, so this is a bit of an edge, but not an overwhelming one).  If I don't really get to use that edge straight-up because the action is all abstracted into some hazy shared imagined space then that's disappointing.  Worse, maybe the GM and I don't agree on the impact of that d8 running die on the SiS.   <br/><br/>There are examples like this all thru the Savage rules.  Without minis, you'd have to throw out or handwave all of them.  If you're gonna do that, why not just play some other lite game that doesn't have a battlemat baked into its DNA?  (Wushu, Over the Edge, Fudge, Risus, the Pool, etc.)\n<blockquote>2) How suitable is it for 1 player / 1 GM play?</blockquote>\nLike D&amp;D4E, Savage emphasizes teamwork, with gang-up bonuses being very significant and helpful.  So you'll lose that part of the game.  <br/><br/>Also, as others have pointed out, it is easy to assign multiple minions to a player to fatten up their forces if  you want to scale up your combats to the place where Savage Worlds is justified.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266759/#Comment_266759" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T15:24:39+00:00" title="April 12, 2010  3:24PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think you'd need the minis for anything.

It's very similar to a lot of the fighty+emo school of indie stuff except that it doesn't have any way for your beliefs and feelings to make you more successful, as written.

It decended from The Great Rail Wars which was a quick play mini's game based on the Deadlands rules.  It basically took all of the Deadlands concepts, boiled them down to single dice of a single size instead of a die pool, redcued character detail down to fit on a small index card (with room for art and lots of blank space) and enabled you to play gangs of 10-30 minis per side in battles that took less time than 5 PCs in a gun fight with 5 NPC in the regular game.  Since the game mechanics were loosely derived from DL you could convert characters from DL to GRW fairly easily, and after we did that for a big town shoot'em up ala Fist Full of Dollars...we pretty much wrapped up our campaign just playing GRW scenarios for the fight scenes.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst edition Savage Worlds was barely more than The Great Rail Wars with the serial numbers filed off...so in a sense, we were playing Savaged Deadlands before Savage Worlds even existed.  I bet alot of groups wound up doing that.  It wouldn't surprise me to learn that reports of such play are what inspired Savage World to be released.<br/>\n<br/>\nIME SW play doesn't *require* minis...but the game is so integrated with them that its almost easier to just whip them out and use them then it is to play without them.  The fact that its so easy to run gangs and military units and have lots of allies in play is a direct result of ite GRW origins.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gavinwulf" title="Gavinwulf"><img alt="Gavinwulf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gavinwulf">Gavinwulf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266803/#Comment_266803" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T18:53:45+00:00" title="April 12, 2010  6:53PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 12, 2010 6:54PM by Gavinwulf.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ron Hammack</cite>Two questions:<br><br>1) How necessary are the minis? Do you need to set them up for every combat or just the big complicated ones?<br><br>2) How suitable is it for 1 player / 1 GM play?</br></br></br></br></blockquote>\n1) The minis are absolutely NOT necessary. But, SW is a game where the gimmicky parts like cards, minis, and bennies actually speed up play even more. When I run Savage Worlds we keep the minis nearby because although we don't plan using them we invariably pull them out in game because we <i>want</i> to.<br/><br/>2) Most of my SW experience has been with one GM &amp; one Player. I have run a very successful Space Western campaign and an Incredibly AWESOME Slaine campaign using SW. Both were with one player. The Slaine one in particular worked well since the PC was a 'Warped One' and there were no other players to overshadow. <br/><br/><br/>Other thoughts: <br/>RPing a character's Hindrances generally awards the player with a bennie. Remember 2-3 bennies + the starting 3 is a total of 5-6 per session. Quite a bit actually. The experienced SW player will rarely use bennies on re-rolls. Using them for soaking wounds is far and away a better alternative. <br/>Also, the more cinematic you want your SW, the more bennies you hand out.<br/>I also let Players create narrative/setting twists for the cost of a bennie. <br/>Example: In my Slaine game the PC was skulking through a ravaged village where a Time Monster (T-Rex) was stomping around. The Player asked, "Is there a tall structure I can climb up or something?" My reply, "There can be the shoddy remnants of a watchtower for a benny." Following this the PC climbed a pole and leaped off it at the passing T-Rex, stabbing it right in the freakin eye with his spear.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266805/#Comment_266805" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T19:09:54+00:00" title="April 12, 2010  7:09PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>As a historical note from a big player of Deadlands way back when it was new and shiny, Savage Words didn't decend directly from Deadlands.

It's my understanding that Shane was motivated to develop SW after working through Weird War Two for  D20 (which he found singularly unsuited for platoon level combat). Then, after not liking a game of Godlike (I believe it was), he decided to develop Savage Worlds, building on The Great Rail Wars. It's not influenced by any Forge thought at all.<br/><br/>I did the Weird War Two re-write for SW and ran several games of it. It does indeed work as advertised and handles those platoon sized battles quite well - I did tank battles, dogfights, naval engagements, the works. It's geared toward battlemat games with minis but I've played just as many without the mat. <br/><br/>I have to admit I don't play it anymore but it does do what it says on the back cover.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266810/#Comment_266810" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T20:41:19+00:00" title="April 12, 2010  8:41PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I got Weird War II for xmas and it's awesome.

It is extremely generic (looks much like someone took a Word document and just flowed it across two columns, then added in some art).

Each chapter sort of flows into the next, so just "quick flipping" through the book, there are no "stand out" markers that let you know you've found the section you want.<br/><br/>2) Break the book up a bit more finely. For example, the first chapter contains large sections for the various character options (skills, edges, etc.), yet there is no visible difference or separation between these sections other than a header with a slightly larger font. Breaking these sections out into chapters of their own (or, at least, visually dividing them as if they were) again would aid both in "quick flipping" to find stuff and in cementing the concepts in the reader's mind.<br/><br/>3) There are no summaries of the long lists of edges, skills etc until the end of the entire character chapter. While I understand why this is done, and even appreciate it on one level, I suspect these summaries might be more useful spread around to the start of their relevant sections, where they would also serve to provide some of the "visual division" I mention above.<br/><br/>4) The entire book is in color, but color is never used to cue the reader. For example, suppose each chapter had a colored block next to the page number (extending over the edge of the page), with each chapter (or section) given a different color. Just by looking at the side of the book, you'd be able to open it pretty close to where you wanted to be.<br/><br/>5) All the headers look very similar. I see the idea behind the graphical tags at the chapter and section levels (marked by a compass and a red splotch, if I recall) but it doesn't really work for me. This is another reason for expanding sections into their own chapters: it flattens out the outline, so you don't need as many "levels" of header. The bold-but-narrow letters of the header font are also a little bit hard to read when thumbing through the book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11939/how-forge-derived-y-is-savage-worlds" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11939/how-forge-derived-y-is-savage-worlds" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11939/how-forge-derived-y-is-savage-worlds/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F11939%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F11939%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
