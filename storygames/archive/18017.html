I'd picked it up from a pile of games that were being given away on the proviso that they were run.<br/><br/>On initial reading through I wasn't sure what I was going to do with it, some of the ideas seemed a bit of a challenge to getting a satisfactory one shot game, but I managed to talk to the author and get my head around things sufficiently to be happy running it. I created a character sheet for the people that would be in play with a cheat sheet on the back for bidding and how dice worked. Also a character sheet for the Fae with the costs of using their powers on the reverse. I also printed out the chapter summaries from the free PDF for character gen and bidding.<br/><br/>Rules As Written every player at the table runs a Person, and a Fae (basically an omnipotent, intangible, driven and fickle entity of any description) that has a deal with another players Person. On top of that the mechanics work best with a reasonable number of NPC's (or NPP's, Non Player Persons as the book calls them.) This felt like a lot of characters on the table to me so I hacked things down a little. Aside from that we were pretty much RAW.<br/><br/>As one of the players wasn't happy with Victorian London as a setting, you decide the setting as part of the game start and I'd thought Victorian or Modern Urban would work well, we settled on running in a generic Medieval-ish setting. Characters are created from scratch with the First player taking on the bulk of the setting creation and other players adding to this as we moved along.<br/><br/>We had - <br/><br/>Jack Fletcher, the charcoal burner. Jack was the third son of the family and the business of making arrows could only supply a living for his two brothers. As such he spent his time tending the charcoal burners on the land they used to grow wood for the arrow shafts and mooning after his true love, Mary. Mary was the village elders daughter and so out of his league, plus she didn't really know he existed. His brothers were much wealthier as there was war in the region and the arrow trade was good, just not good enough for them to employ him.<br/><br/>Jerome, a travelling gypsy who had arrived at the town to spend the harsh winter before moving on. He was an itinerant worker and violin player.<br/><br/>Old Madge, the village wise woman come witch. She had access to hedge magic that allowed her to tend to the community but while she was once stunningly attractive she was now an old and sick woman.<br/><br/>Young Christopher Fletcher, the nephew of Jack, eleven year old Christopher was in to everything in the village. He was apprenticed to his father, Christopher Fletcher Snr in the arrow making business.<br/><br/>This established some facts about the setting. The community was at the large village/small town sort of size in a medieval setting. Magic was expected but equally a suspect commodity. It was Winter and there was fighting going on in the area around, we would also decide the fighting was a chivalric, knights and squires type thing. These things were written almost like a Microscope palette on a piece of paper in the middle of the table.<br/><br/>The game uses 4 attributes, Head, Heart, Life and Loins all fairly emotion based, Head is how clever you are, Heart how you deal with emotions, Life is your dreams and aspirations and Loins is your drive and willingness to get ahead and best others. You assign values to each, two at 2, one at 3 and one at 4. In the game a conflict relies on one of these emotions and it becomes the target number on a D6 for success or failure. We ended up with a mix across the 4 characters, Jack being lead by Heart, Jerome by Loins, Old Madge by Head and Young Christopher by Life.<br/><br/>Each character had two goals, Jack's were quite simple, he wanted to Marry Mary and To be given an important and well paid job. Jerome was looking to gain enough money to move on after the Winter and to Find a way out of his Fairy Deal. Old Madge wished to Get revenge on Christopher Snr and to Be restored to her previous good health and Young Christopher wanted to become the squire to a knight and to Gain the acclaim of the people of the town. Finally we sorted out some supports for each character (additional ways to get temporary dice through innate abilities, skills, contacts or possessions) and went on to create the Fae.<br/><br/>We split in to two groups of two and each group created a Fae for the game. This is done by answering a few questions, who they are, what they want and what distracts them. We had-<br/><br/>The Spirit of Winter, He is the ice wind in the trees, the frost on the ground. The icy hand of death by cold. He wanted to reap enough souls to power his survival through the summer and was distracted by festivities and celebration.<br/><br/>My Lover, A flying spirit who appeared with a flash of light as a beautiful young girl. She wanted to feed on the dreams and inspirations of humans and she was distracted by death and sadness.<br/><br/>Finally each person had already made a deal with one of these Fae, it was decided that My Lover was responsible for the enchanting music that Jerome could play on his violin that allowed him to magically alter peoples emotions. She had also made a pact with a much younger Madge to give her access to the power to make love potions. The Spirit of Winter had come to Jack in the forest while he was bemoaning his lot in life and promised him Power so he could succeed in bettering himself. He had come to Young Christopher during his first hunt, when the callow youth was wavering at the point of loosing his arrow and given him the ability to take life without caring.<br/><br/>Each player rolled 6D6 and gave any 6's straight to the Fae they had a deal with, keeping the rest ready to bid in conflicts. 1's were particularly special as they gave the ability to demand power or favour from the Fae as part of the deal, although they too would then go to the Fae as points of power it could use on those who had a deal with it. This had been quite intense so we broke for drinks and on our return dove in to scenes.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo" title="w00hoo"><img alt="w00hoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/395/nB2PXS15U6BFQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">w00hoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409339/#Comment_409339" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-17T11:26:28+00:00" title="March 17, 2013 11:26AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jack was getting drunk in the house used as a meeting place come tavern. Both of his brothers were there (two NPC's added, Christopher Fletcher Snr, a bigoted and opinionated man and John Fletcher the big dumb middle brother) along with Jerome, Jack was trying to get up the courage to write a love letter to Mary worried that the snowdrops he'd sent her hadn't won her over. Christopher told him that women wanted powerful successful men, not love ditties and fancies. Jerome said that women could be won over with music and song and to do what you were good at to win their hand. This got quite heated and by the end of the 'debate' Jack had forgotten any idea of continuing his wooing as his brothers and Jerome were on the verge of fisticuffs in the street. Instead he tried to intervene, calming them down and convincing them not to fight. The conflict was close, Jerome would fight to protect his honour, Christopher wouldn't back down and definitely wouldn't apologise for his slurs against the gypsy and his people but eventually Jack won through, violence was averted, but the last of his coin was spent on buying drinks for them all.<br/><br/>Mechanically, the conflict was announced as 'Could Jack convince everyone to calm down and not fight?' It was based off of his Heart of 4 so all dice from 1 - 4 that Jack had could be bid for success and all dice that the players controlling Christopher Snr, John and Jerome had that were a 5 or 6 could be bid for failure. As Jerome was there in person he could also roll support dice to bid in. Jack used his support of 'Is Loved by his Mother' to argue against his brothers bringing their family name in to disrepute which tipped it over to a win in his favour but as each dice bid has narration attached as he bid the last dice the offer of 'and I'll use the last of my coin to buy us all drinks' left him pennyless. Also, NPC's were created on post it notes and left in the middle of the table so anyone could play them in a scene as it was needed, rather than assigning them to individuals for the duration as per the rules.<br/><br/>The following day we saw Old Madge and Jerome talking in her house in the woods outside the village while Young Christopher skulks outside eaves-dropping. Old Madge wants revenge on Christopher Snr for past deeds and sees Jerome as the means. She is trying to convince him to waylay the man in the woods and beat him up. As she discusses it the air goes cold and time is frozen by the Spirit of Winter who offers her a Deal. It wants Christopher's soul and wants her to convince the gypsy to attack the man and leave the body lying in the woods where 'I will do the rest'. Old Madge says that she wants something in return, she is ill and worried that she won't live out the Winter. The Spirit promises that if she agrees to this, it will not take her soul this winter and she agrees. Time flows once more and the icy breath soon dissipates as the air warms around them. The gypsy says that he has made a deal with a Fae which he regrets, he will not kill this man, but he will attack him, if she can promise to free him from his fairy promise. She says that she can. As Old Madge watches him go Young Christopher tries to hide from her sight but she spots him. Unable to give chase and unwilling to call him out she pretends she has not and returns inside.<br/><br/>There is a knock on her door, and it is Young Christopher, he enters, brazen as anything, and tells Old Madge that he has overheard all that she has planned. Then to everyones surprise continues 'and my father would never walk out in to the woods to meet your gypsy alone. I will spin him a story of a fine stag I have found and how he should hunt it but to be sure it is killed with our arrows we must hunt alone. I will take him to the woods and at an agreed spot the gypsy can attack him." Madge agrees readily.<br/><br/>The following day Young Christopher is leading his father in to the woods, his father is berating the boys foolishness as despite the lads protests he can see no sign of this Stag they are following. As he says this the Spirit of Winter makes depressions in the snow to emulate the stags tracks and help the boy lead his father further in to the woods. At the agreed point the youth falls, clutching his ankle he has twisted and while his father turns to attend Jerome, mask covering his face, jumps from the bushes and smashes the man to the floor with the pommel of his fine hunting knife. As he falls the mans clothes start to ice over and he is almost cocooned where he lays. Jerome grabs a fine silver brooch from the mans cloak, this will help pay his onward journey and snaps the mans fine hunting bow in two. Young Christopher says that they should run from this place but as they start to flee Jerome realises the lad isn't on his heels. He turns his head and sees the boy stopped, his bow raised and an arrow notched ready to fire in to the gypsy's back as he flees.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo" title="w00hoo"><img alt="w00hoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/395/nB2PXS15U6BFQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">w00hoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409340/#Comment_409340" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-17T11:26:53+00:00" title="March 17, 2013 11:26AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Meanwhile in the witches house Jack has come to ask for an elixir that he might use on his intended. Not to cloud her mind completely, he wishes her to love him for who he is, or reject him as she will, but to make her susceptible to his first attempts. He fears that she will rebut him before he has had a chance to talk at all and would ensure that didn't happen. Old Madge is assuring him she has just the thing when My Lover appears to him. Once more time slows, but this time as if flowing through a sweet syrup. She tells him that he has family in danger and only he can save them. He is eager but she continues that while she will tell him where he must go, and if he doesn't go now his brother will surely die, in return he must give her something. He asks what and she says the love of his true heart. He falters. Blood is important to him, but his Mary. My Lover assures him, Mary will still be with him, she will be devoted to him as a wife and desire him as a husband, it is merely the spark of emotion that she will take. With little option he takes the deal and as time flows once more Old Madge recognises the presence of the Fae. She tries to talk Jack out of leaving, Fae are not to be trusted, but he runs off in to the wood, to the spot the Fae has shown him.<br/><br/>The arrow leaves the bow but Jerome is forewarned and is a skilled fighter, he dives to one side and the projectile ricochets through the bushes where he stood. His knife in his hand he charges towards the boy as Jack comes on the scene. Seeing a masked attacker running towards his nephew he shouts out. Outnumbered Jerome turns and flees in to the woods, Jack looks to Young Christopher and breathlessly warns him, your father is nearby and is dying. Go to him, tend to him, I will chase his attacker. As he gives chase through the woods the boy returns to his fathers side, takes a comfortable spot on a tree stump, and watches him die.<br/><br/>Jack is losing Jerome. His woodcraft skills help him, but the gypsy is also skilled and quicker than the already tired charcoal burner. As a last resort Jack calls to the Spirit of Winter for aid in tracking down his brothers attacker. The Spirit creates footprints of snow where Jerome has trod and Jack easily follows him back to his camp. He hides in the bushes as the assailant removes his mask, revealing the gypsy's grim visage.<br/><br/>[Mechanically here we stopped a scene where Young Christopher was the spotlight character at a cliff hanger but came back in the scene with Jerome as the spotlight meaning Jerome used his Loins as the controlling element and could win the conflict and avoid getting killed, as Jack then framed the scene of his arrival he gave chase but had to resort to using a '1' to win, therefore asking one of the Fae he had a deal with for magical aid.]<br/> <br/>We are in the town, evening has come and Young Christopher stands before the community while Richard the Elder and Old Madge question him about the murder of his father. The boy says he saw it all, the attack by the masked man, and was unable to stop the ferocity. When asked if there is anything of the man that might identify the murderer he thinks and says 'yes, he was carrying a hunting knife the like I've only seen once before, in the hands of the gypsy traveller who has come in to our village'. Old Madge argues that this might not be so obvious a case as it appears, Christopher Snr was a small minded bigot of a man and may have brought this upon himself. Was he not seen arguing with the gypsy in the tap room previous night? While the boy tries to defend his fathers honour it is agreed that the man was not the best of people. But nonetheless he has been murdered most foully and the killer is known. Young Christopher gives an impassioned speech and the townsfolk rally round, the gypsy shall be hunted down and hung from the highest bough.<br/><br/>Back at her house Old Madge find the gypsy is sat in wait for her. He pleads his innocence of the murder and lays it all at Young Christopher's feet, Old Madge agrees that all of the Fletchers are alike and not to be trusted. Jerome must flee now and she takes the brooch from him, melting it down to small ingots to buy a horse from the smith for his escape. As she leaves the gypsy calls to My Lover to curse the boy who has brought this upon him to never be believed.<br/><br/>My Lover has little power at this point, but sufficient to lay a curse on Young Christopher that 'You can't tell the truth when with two or more people or else you will confess your sins until two people have forgiven you.' [This is the format of a curse in the game, either you must do W when X happens or do Y until Z, or you must not do X if you do Y happens until Z. Thinking back I'm not sure My Lover needed to do a curse as the power was coming from Jerome rather than it being a punishment against someone she had a deal with, but it felt right at the time.]<br/><br/>Old Madge arrives as the mob is gathering and tries to buy a horse from the blacksmith. He is reluctant when she tells him that she is going to sacrifice it to help find the gypsy, being a smith he is somewhat against magic, especially something as dark as blood magic and sacrifices, although being a horsetrader his primary take on this is to up his price. This happens to be to 'more than Old Madge has'. She tries to convince him that he owes her, but he says all debts for her services have been paid already. As she is losing the argument she calls on the Spirit of Winter to aid her and the blacksmith is distracted as the doors to his stable swell with ice and crack asunder, horses fleeing in to the night stampeding through the mob. As he rushes off a single horse walk calmly up to Old Madge and she takes its reins, disappearing back in to the night.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo" title="w00hoo"><img alt="w00hoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/395/nB2PXS15U6BFQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">w00hoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409342/#Comment_409342" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-17T11:29:44+00:00" title="March 17, 2013 11:29AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            She arrives to find Jack and Jerome arguing at her house. Jack has trailed Jerome from his camp, unaware that he is anything more than a mugger, and overheard the conversation between Old Madge and Jerome before barging in on the gypsy. Jerome had no wish to do violence to Jack, however the normally peace loving Jack is possessed by the Spirit of Winter and attacks Jerome. Jerome is able to overcome him and tie him up but resists the urge to kill him. On Old Madges return the three realise that they have all been played and must put a stop to Young Christopher once and for all but this is interrupted as the torch wielding mob arrives at the Witches door, the boy has convinced them with his lies that Old Madge was at the root of his fathers murder and more besides. She should be killed for her black magic rites that have cursed the whole village.<br/><br/>Things now happen very quickly and I can't get the order quite straight. Both Fae now take a strong interest in the lives of the humans in front of them and are looking for Old Madge to decide the fate of those around them. My Lover agrees to release the gypsy from his pact in return for protecting Jack from death, I think from the mob who were ever more frenzied from Young Christophers ever bolder lies. Released from his pact the gypsy rides off on the fast horse and escapes. Young Christopher breaks his geas and starts to confess his part in it all to the disgust of the mob who have been building a pyre for the witch which they tie him to in her stead. As Jack takes a burning brand to set the wood alight Young Christopher makes a last ditch deal with My Lover, to save his life and he will change his evil ways. She takes the deal and as the flames take they are directed purely to the bonds around the boy, he emerges from the flames his clothes burnt clear as if reborn, the only sign of his ordeal burn marks to his wrists and ankles. For her part in this, as Winter leaves the scene foiled, Old Madge is cursed that one in every two children she assists in birthing until spring will result in a death.<br/><br/>We did an epilogue for the four characters. Jack takes up the vacant position in the family firm and marries Mary, but the marriage is merely successful, never loving. Young Christopher travels, speaking to others on how they can better themselves by believing in a higher power, but is never happy in himself and lives an unrewarding existence. Jerome makes it to the city, but the spark for music he had is gone thanks to the breaking of his pact. While his life no longer has that passion within it, he realises that he is happier in himself and so is content. The first birthing Old Madge is called to goes badly and the news spreads around the region, she is not called upon for aid through the winter and her money and stores dwindle as the snows fall. Shunned by the village, on the first day of Spring she breathes her last breath and dies.<br/><br/>The four of us really enjoyed the game, but felt that at times the dice mechanism was obstructive. Particularly for chunks of the game the player of Young Christopher had a lot of dice out to Fae and his remaining dice were 3's and 4's which proved hard to be successful with but equally difficult to use to give the option of re-rolling them. I doubt we could have had the game without the set up that Geasa gave us at the beginning, but it was commented that after that set-up a more *World style system might have been better. I was happy with the modifications on the Fae, but there was a lot of discussion afterwards about quite what the powers the Fae had and who it would be best for them to effect. The game was likened to both Sorcerer and In Nobilis in the way it felt during play. I'm sure at some point it'll come off the shelf to give it another go though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard" title="EpistolaryRichard"><img alt="EpistolaryRichard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard">EpistolaryRichard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409635/#Comment_409635" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-19T16:45:44+00:00" title="March 19, 2013  4:45PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2013 4:47PM by EpistolaryRichard.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for writing this all up. This was a solid game for me. I'm not that familiar with faerie folklore or their traditional role in literature, but I felt games creating stories focused on individuals trading humanity for power in deals with hidden twists has a lot of potential.<br/><br/>You advised at the beginning that it was good for us to create connected characters, but looking back I wonder if that's the case. Could we told four tales of separate people, connected primarily through the fae?<br/><br/>I do wonder if our experience was typical of the game and particularly whether my own play pushed our story towards the 'indie GMless freeform mainstream' (if I can possibly use those all words together without someone's head exploding). <br/><br/>Specifically, what I mean is pushing it towards a more PvP, plot-driven story rather than simple reflection and exploration of character. Should Geasa happen over days or years? Should we focus on specific events or developing the characters' entire lives?<br/><br/>Young Christopher was certainly never intended to become such a sociopath. He was originally created to be a 'helper' character, someone with a few dreams of his own, but would primarily try to help others with what they wanted. I can trace the logical progression - first the creation of Winter and its thirst for souls added the themes of death and violence, then Madge's motives added revenge. I then added the latent bigotry towards outsiders with Christopher Senior's behaviour to Jerome as it seemed an 'obvious' direction to go. <br/><br/>By this time I was wondering how I was going to engage in this story as the only people who needed help (and they did need help) were Madge and Jerome, but they were planning to off my father! And so Young Christopher offering to help with that spoke volumes about his own character and pretty much set him on his parth from then on - and I only retrospectively justified his behaviour by reference to his deal with Winter to remove his fear of taking life.<br/><br/>We ended up with a solid story, but I wonder if we should have gone for each other so hard. If we hadn't, would we have felt more like we were playing a different game? Did I want to swap out the mechanics for *World because in my head I was playing a *World game? Perhaps this is the reason I struggled with bringing the fae into it was because there was so much happening between the humans. The fae were almost just power-ups to help the humans battle each other - and when it came time for the two fae to do battle, we discovered there weren't any rules for it! So maybe such PvP wasn't something the designer contemplated.<br/><br/>My personal concerns over whether we gave the game a fair outing aside, I wasn't in love with the mechanics. Maybe it's my background in GMless, but they seemed more than we needed. Fundamentally, you just need a way to move 'power' from the humans to the fae, a way for the fae to influence the world, and a simple resolution mechanic for any human challenges. The dice-rolling, the bidding, the four different stats, the connections, sure fine if you like that kind of thing but not needed for the story. Conflicts shouldn't be your focus. The dreams and the deals should be. If the game isn't always pushing you to make twisted deals with the various fae to help achieve your dreams then it's missing its USP. I get the feeling that there's a more focused game on this theme to be made here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan" title="Jonathan"><img alt="Jonathan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan">Jonathan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409652/#Comment_409652" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-19T21:52:25+00:00" title="March 19, 2013  9:52PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm glad you enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The original intent of the game was to be co-operatively confrontational between the players. Either between the people that you create, or between the NPPs and the person in the spotlight. The Fae were intended to be part of that PvP confrontation, dramatic power shifts that our outside of the players control and beyond what's kind of possible in a "reality" sense. They were never mean to confront each other directly, just use their "tools" to get what they desire.<br/><br/>That said, I read what went on and loved that idea. I'm working on some mods to the game that I think are interesting and this write up gave me a lot to think about beyond the things I knew I needed working on.<br/><br/>If you want to try to make a more focused game, go for it.

PvP was intended to be a part of the game and characters with conflicting goals was a good thing. As I read it it's not a game about a group of people banding together to attain a single 'objective'. Much more a melting pot thing.<br/><br/>Having said that, after play I can't see any reason you couldn't actually have 4 completely disconnected characters with the Fae flitting between them. Each one tells a completely separate story (potentially separated by time as well as space) and the other players take on the NPC's within that World (thereby mechanically getting to do the whole dice movement thing.) Equally the game could play well with the time frame much longer although you'd need all players on board and a wish to see the next chronological action can be quite strong at a table. In our case, with the way we'd framed Winters goal there was a suggestion it would never be a large scope time wise, although there was nothing stopping us from saying 'Winters goal is the same every year, any time we skip forwards a few years he's obviously always managed it to that point'.<br/><br/>The feel of wanting Fae vs Fae was probably a side product of only having two and giving them a 'same pantheon' feel. The cold and death motifs of Winter vs the warmth and creation motifs of My Lover are pretty much stock versions of the Summer vs Winter control within 'traditional' fairy courts, even down to them being different genders. All we really missed was them being married to each other :-)   . RAW there's actually no suggestion that the Fae mesh in any sensible way, one could be a tree spirit, almost a Dryad, the other could be Bob's magic stone. All they actually need is the understanding that they have power, a goal and a need for service.<br/><br/>I was interested by the fact I was all for the concept that Fae can do anything if given permission and nothing if not while others were much more of the idea that Fae can only effect those they've made a deal with. That was probably the most jarring 'un-confirmed bit' of what we were doing for me. I would have preferred that 'deal with the devil' approach where the Fae were using their tools to give them permission to get their goals. So with Winter 'I want things to die, but I can't kill them. If you tell me to do something and I can sensibly kill someone as part of that then I will'. I liked the concept of power corrupts that that would bring. That when faced with a '1' it's not something you really want to use, not because you'll be handing away a bit of control to the Fae (although that'll happen too) but because you'll get what you asked for, but maybe not in the spirit you asked for it...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg" title="semajmaharg"><img alt="semajmaharg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/n0TRVVHW3SOVY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg">semajmaharg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410121/#Comment_410121" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-22T12:55:11+00:00" title="March 22, 2013 12:55PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>(I played Old Madge)</i><br/><br/>I really liked the game and would be up for giving it another go at some point.<br/><br/>In terms of the core mechanic, I think it had potential but could do with some tweaking. One problem I felt was that if you had a bad set of dice you were essentially screwed. It occurred to me that that could be solved simply by allowing the loser of a contest to reroll all their dice, to mix it up a bit.<br/><br/>I also wondered if you could better resolve (eg) head vs heart contests (eg, appealing to intellect in a contest where the initiator is appealing to emotion) by allowing the player to roll their opposing stat as a resource (but otherwise the normal rules would apply).<br/><br/>One thing I really liked was the feeling of the dice stacking up as the fae get more and more powerful. In the case of Winter we imagined this as the weather gradually worsening. The rules about 6s and 1s I adored and would want to preserve in any hack.<br/><br/>In terms of what Richard suggested in terms of parallel stories, I agree. You could also tell four disconnected stories united by a common fae, Short Cuts/Magnolia style. But I also like the way w00hoo ran it. At some point I'd like to try it with a modern urban setting. Our medieval setting worked very well, but it would be nice to try it as originally intended.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan" title="Jonathan"><img alt="Jonathan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan">Jonathan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410242/#Comment_410242" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-23T13:15:25+00:00" title="March 23, 2013  1:15PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It could always do with some tweaking.

Any opportunity you have to divest them is a good one.<br/><br/>As for parallel stories, you can totally do that. It's happened even as is, the thing is that it tends to increase the playing time. However, with a common of communal Fae that might work a lot better. There's that element in West Side Horror, where there's a single common big creature, but I tried to make it more cohesive rather than spreading it apart.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg" title="semajmaharg"><img alt="semajmaharg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/n0TRVVHW3SOVY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg">semajmaharg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410414/#Comment_410414" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-25T15:48:07+00:00" title="March 25, 2013  3:48PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quick thought: have you tried the game with different dice?<br/><br/>One issue with using d6s is that it means you have a 1 in 3 chance of that die being essentially in the hands of the Fae.
