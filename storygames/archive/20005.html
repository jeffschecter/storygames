I'm tired. And this is probably a terrible idea, but...<br/><br/>What are the best, most useful bits and bobs of both Fate Core / Accelerated and Apocalypse World, Dungeon World, and Monsters of the Week that could be cobbled together to make a good, clean, quick little system?<br/><br/>Something like Fate Accelerated for *World games. Yeah, I know about Simple World, but that's not working for me.<br/><br/>The basic resolution mechanics would be pure *World, with the 2d6 roll + modifier and the 10+, 7-9, 6- scale intact. Only players rolling and something interesting happening as the result of every roll would certainly be kept. Along with the majority of the GM advice and GM moves.<br/><br/>From Fate Accelerated, I think the Approaches, character Aspects, and Conditions are the most useful ideas. Though I'm not sure about the band-aid of Aspects for everything nor the meta-currency of Fate Points. There's something to be said for the finality of a roll result standing and moving on with the fiction instead of rolling then starting a negotiation for the result.<br/><br/>I like the idea of Playbooks from *World games, but think using them strictly as classes is too limiting. Something more along the lines of Worlds in Peril's use of them as Origin and Drive / Goal could work. But that would lead back to having to write new Playbooks for every genre, setting, whatever.<br/><br/>Maybe something like combining character Aspects and Playbooks. Along with the character Aspect the player comes up with a move for that Aspect, akin to spending a Fate Point through that Aspect...<br/><br/>Not sure. Just noodling.<br/><br/>Any idea or suggestions on how you would cobble these two together into a narrative-focused chimera system?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amphigorist" title="amphigorist"><img alt="amphigorist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/877/nOZYIGACEOYYP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amphigorist">amphigorist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442416/#Comment_442416" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-03T09:41:32+00:00" title="February  3, 2015  9:41AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't really know Fate well enough to have any insight into this, but I do know that Ryan Macklin has <a href="http://ryanmacklin.com/2014/07/fateworld/" rel="nofollow">already done it</a> (in a more-than-half-joking sense, but still).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442417/#Comment_442417" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-03T09:43:38+00:00" title="February  3, 2015  9:43AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 3, 2015 9:52AM by BeePeeGee.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been thinking a lot along these lines recently. Add to this <b>Cortex Plus</b> which is also bringing some neat tricks to the game (like Relationships, Initiative system, Doom Pools...).<br/><br/>Basically, *W/Fate are quite different in some aspects (pun). Fate Core/FAE is a <i>generic system</i> that lets you play whatever setting/game you want.<br/>*W is always customized to a <i>specific setting</i> with the <i>playbooks</i>.<br/>Also, as GM, it seems to me Fate is encouraging more a <i>collaborative GM-style</i>, whereas AW draws a clear line between <i>GM vs players</i>.<br/><br/>This makes it difficult to merge both in a single game. So I'd recommend:<br/>1. Based on Fate (character sheet, dice mechanics), hack AW ideas into it<br/>2. Based on *W (Playbooks), hack Fate mechnics/ideas into it<br/>3. Create an entirely new system (this is what I'm attempting at the moment, silly me)<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Good things about Fate</span>:<br/>- Aspects (along with Compel mechanics, Fate Points, Temporary Aspects)<br/>- Fate dice! (they look nice and have very similar distribution to 2d6; nice to use them for *W)<br/>- Unified mechanics that let you stack anything (skill, boost, advantage, compel, team work, stunt...)<br/>- One scale that's used for everything (difficulty, dice roll, skill, damage, bonus...)<br/>- Fate Point mechanics (bonus, narrative, aspects)<br/>- Stress and Consequences<br/>- Setting independent, adapt to any setting easily<br/>- City Creation (Dresden Files)<br/>- Modes (introduced with Atomic Robo RPG, should work very well in AW direction)<br/>- Advancement works well in long campaigns<br/>- Quite crunchy while flexible and story-oriented<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Good things about *W</span> (as far as I know, don't know it well):<br/>- Narrative freedom, less dependent on dice mechanics (if you want to do something, you do it)<br/>- Playbooks (quick, setting specific, vivid characters)<br/>- Moves<br/>- Very simple mechanics<br/>- 7-9 rolls (a lot of intentionally ambiguous results)<br/>- Contructing Fronts, Threats, building soft/hard moves<br/>- Hard choices<br/>- Elimination of railroading<br/>- Generally, superb GM advice<br/>- (probably much more I'm not familiar with)<br/><br/>My advice for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Option 1 (based on Fate, hack *W into it)</span>:<br/>-  most of the AW GM advice is very generic and adaptable to Fate<br/>- enhance char sheet with nice playbook style creation options ("choose 2 of these")<br/>- let "Success at a Cost" happen more often and give AW-style choices<br/>- Use AW-style Moves instead of Fate Stunts<br/>- Use Fate Modes (Atomic Robo RPG), incorporate ideas from AW moves<br/>- become a more dangerous, threatening GM, use AW for Creating Fronts<br/>- as GM, stick to AW advice on no preparation/railroading<br/><br/>My advice for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Option 2 (based on *W, hack Fate into it)</span>:<br/>- Use Fate Dice (i.e. "0" instead of 7-9; "+2" instead of 10+)<br/>- Use Fate mechanics for handling damage/harm<br/>- Rewrite Playbook moves/details as compellable Fate Aspects<br/>- As GM compel the hell out of your players' aspects!<br/>- Introduce temporary aspects (possibly also as temporary moves)<br/>- Use situation aspects<br/>- Use Fate Stress and Consequences<br/><br/>On <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Option 3 (build own system)</span>:<br/>I'm playing with self-made rules for a year now and keep on tweaking them. To be honest, I seem to be enjoying more and more Freeform narrative play. So, things becoming more and more simplified.<br/>- As a character sheet,  I use something probably closest to FU (Freeform Universal)<br/>- I play it mostly freeform/narative. <br/>- If I need dice mechanics, as a GM, I set a "gut feeling difficulty" between 10%-90% and roll with a d10. That's it.<br/>- I love using random table wherever applicable<br/><br/><br/>Generally, with games like AW/Fate/Cortex Plus, it's less the system mechanics but the <i>style of roleplaying</i> that makes the difference in my opinion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442421/#Comment_442421" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-03T11:35:39+00:00" title="February  3, 2015 11:35AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 3, 2015 11:36AM by 2097.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I'd just start with *W, switch out the 2d6 for 4dF (and switch out the 7-9 for 0-2) and call it a day.

The part of *W that wasn't mentioned (tight coupling of fictional triggers to mechanics, and an avoidance of generic conflict resolution) is the part that proves pretty difficult to handle in generic *W games (unless you're going with a one-move system, a la World of Dungeons).<br/><br/>Playbooks kind of work well for either system!

Stunts might look like playbook-specific moves, offering their own specific meanings of rolling 6-, 7-9, or 10+ to do a particular thing, they might grant a +1 to use a particular approach in a particular way, they might modify the rules in a particular situation (like when you dish out or receive stress/consequences), or they might grant some sort of once per session superpower.<br/><br/>There are three moves.<br/><br/>You attempt to place a consequence on someone.<br/><br/>You purely defensively attempt to resist a consequence being placed on you.<br/><br/>You do anything else risky (maybe not physically dangerous but where failure could make things worse), roll 2d6+the appropriate approach based on how you were doing it.<br/><br/>6 or less: things get worse<br/>7-9: success at cost or limited success (and per discussions in Fate-land, to approach something forcefully is to have approached <i>without</i> primary concern for being careful, clever, flashy, quick, or sneaky, so limited success would involve some side effect of the lack of one or more of those things)<br/>10-12: a good success<br/><br/>The total limit of modifiers on a roll is 7 (whether +7 or -7).<br/><br/>When you act consistent with your aspects (i.e. you're rolling for an action for which you'd be able to invoke your aspect by paying a fate point in fate or for which the GM compelled you) and fail, you gain an XP. If you decline a GM compel, you lose an XP (but you can't go below 0). XP can be cashed in for gains to your approaches, adding stunts, or modifying your aspects.<br/><br/>You have three stress boxes that work like in Fate. If a given stress box is marked, you have to take a consequence instead. There are -1, -2, and -3 consequences; if you don't have the slot free for a consequence, you have to take the next worse available one. Whenever the consequence would impair your action, you take the penalty for it when rolling; they're cumulative. The consequences you put on others are counted +1, +2, +3 and likewise cumulatively count in your favor when it makes sense when you're making a roll involving the other. <br/><br/>When someone would receive a consequence but has no free consequence slots, they're taken out. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442561/#Comment_442561" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-06T09:12:17+00:00" title="February  6, 2015  9:12AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 6, 2015 1:35PM by 2097.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems to me that *W was born out of this mindset: <a href="http://lumpley.com/index.php/anyway/thread/599" rel="nofollow">The Dice &amp; Cloud series.</a><br/><br/>Introducing Aspects to that is not obvious.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442730/#Comment_442730" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-10T05:12:27+00:00" title="February 10, 2015  5:12AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would definitely not want to deal with an ever-lasting need to write a dozen or more playbooks for every possible iteration of a campaign idea.

Someone with the "Built like a Truck!" Aspect gets to use that move on things a normal human can't.<br/><br/>It might be worth writing out the kinds of things you can do as a player in FATE (the ones you're particularly interested in, that is), and then converting each one to a *world-style move. See how many there actually are, and if it's manageable enough to suit your priorities.<br/><br/>For instance, "Compel a player's Aspect" is a basic FATE move. In the *world sphere, it will look something like:<br/><br/>MC Moves:<br/>* Compel a player's Aspect: offer a player an opportunity with <i>very much</i> strings attached.

I don't think expanding the list of player moves beyond what's in the DW book would be serviceable, really. The obvious stuff, sure, but you're not going to need much more than what's already there. Hack and Slash plus Volley are almost exactly the same move, save the proviso for marking off ammo. I don't think that's particularly important to worry about. <br/><br/>Starting with Fate's actions you would have something like: Attack, Defend, Overcome, Create Advantage. <br/><br/>DW's basic moves are: Hack and Slash, Volley, Defy Danger, Defend, Spout Lore, Discern Realities, Parley, Aid or Interfere.<br/><br/>You could either rework Fate's actions to *W moves or combine and condense the *W moves where possible to shorten the list a la Fate.<br/><br/>While slightly different, H&amp;S and Volley are basically the same move. So that's Attack. Defy Danger and Defend are different enough to keep separate. Spout Lore and Discern Realities are minor variations on each other so they could be combined. Parley is its own thing, though I'm not sure it's necessary. Aid or Interfere is basically Create Advantage.<br/><br/>So that's eight DW moves and Fate's four actions smooshed into six *Fate\u2122 moves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442736/#Comment_442736" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-10T10:12:34+00:00" title="February 10, 2015 10:12AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you want a generic "Fate Core World", I would look into the Fate skill system and distill them into DW-style basic moves.<br/>You could even keep the Fate skill pyramid and use them for your roll + bonus.<br/>Still, it's hard to write moves - which are very closely tight to the fiction - without defining boundaries for the setting (i.e. D&amp;D-style play, urban fiction, SF ...).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442756/#Comment_442756" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-11T01:41:18+00:00" title="February 11, 2015  1:41AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's way too much to deal with in Core.

Then simply giving GM advice where necessary to differentiate between the "moves". As this is one of the hang-ups some more trad minded gamers have with *World games, keeping the kick-ass resolution mechanic while also smoothing it out and streamlining things seems like a good idea.<br/><br/>So something like this:<br/><br/>Roll 2d6 + modifier.<br/><br/>10+ you succeed; do what you wanted.<br/>7-9 you succeed at cost; do what you wanted but there is a twist or setback, GM move.<br/>6- you fail; GM narrates the outcome, GM move.<br/><br/>along with specific advice for the GM on how to adjudicate attacks, defenses, and investigation differently would be a good way to go.<br/><br/>But yeah, FAE's Approaches are spot on for me. Mostly because they do more than tell the player and GM how strong the character is, rather they're also characterization tools. This character is more Careful than anything else (i.e. Careful has the highest bonus) is a lot more informative than "Shoot +2" or "Dex 18" will ever be.<br/><br/>To me, that kind of melding of characterization and mechanics is exactly the kind of thing to pursue, along with the melding of narrative and mechanics that *World games already do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442775/#Comment_442775" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-12T03:54:35+00:00" title="February 12, 2015  3:54AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What is the fictional trigger for that move?<br/><br/>World of Dungeons works very well with one move because "when you attempt something risky" works really well with encompassing dungeon crawling: it's a series of sustained risks. It also keeps the conversation well anchored: here's the risk you're taking, here's whether it succeeds or fails.<br/><br/>If you tried to condense the FAE procedure to one move, it reads as: "When you try to do something and you are opposed by someone or something....". <br/><br/>When you're dealing with a wide scope, everything from investigation to combat and back again, it may be tougher, or introduce different concerns. I think a bunch more weight might fall to the GM: particularly, issues of scope become tougher: when the players want to do X, what level of fictional resolution are we working at? How many rolls will it more or less take?<br/><br/>(I'm saying 'may' not as a rhetorical device, but because I honestly don't know and don't think it's necessarily a showstopper. Maybe it'll be totally cool.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442780/#Comment_442780" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-12T06:56:31+00:00" title="February 12, 2015  6:56AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure why that would be particularly difficult here when so many other games use a single resolution mechanic that's broadly applied.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442790/#Comment_442790" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-12T16:25:55+00:00" title="February 12, 2015  4:25PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 12, 2015 4:27PM by Paul_T.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Then simply giving GM advice where necessary to differentiate between the "moves".

You have a FATE menu but you resolve actions *World-style.  (If you keep *World Basic Moves as is, I think you're basically screwed on the specialization front, because the Basic Moves are too broad.)<br/><br/>I know you said you don't want a giant list of Moves, but I imagine the problem isn't the triggers ("Stealth" becomes "When you try to avoid detection" -- easy) but rather the outcomes, right?  And I agree, I wouldn't want to have to flip through 20+ different "pick from" lists.  So what I would do would be to decouple Move triggers from Move outcomes.  "Stealth" doesn't roll on a "Stealth" list, instead it rolls on either:<br/>- an outcome list for a broader category of actions, e.g. something about advantageous position (which could also be used for Acrobatics or other tactical movement skills)<br/>- an outcome list for a broader category of intentions, e.g. something about tricking people (which could also be used for Manipulation or other "get one over on someone" skills)<br/><br/>In this method, some *World outcomes get less specific via the text, but then possibly <i>more</i> specific via the trigger.  If you start with the combo of "it works, but with strings attached" and "I was attempting Stealth", you probably don't need too much more from a specific outcome list.  A generic list of "strings attached" might do it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442848/#Comment_442848" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-14T02:40:21+00:00" title="February 14, 2015  2:40AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, sorry.

They think fiction first.

Once you introduce, "attack", "defend", "defy danger", "create advantage", etc as mechanics <i>for the players to worry about</i>, the player no longer thinks "I want to do X", rather they start thinking "I want to do X, and the mechanics for that are..."<br/><br/>Leave the specific mechanics to the GM, leave the general resolution framework to the players. All the rolls are player facing, almost all the mechanics are GM facing, so the player can stay focused on what's important, the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442890/#Comment_442890" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-15T02:48:30+00:00" title="February 15, 2015  2:48AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the concern is that if every fictional action has the same mechanics attached to its resolution, that's just as bad as thinking in terms of the mechanics, because it means the details of what you narrate cease to matter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442894/#Comment_442894" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-15T04:52:19+00:00" title="February 15, 2015  4:52AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That makes no sense whatsoever.

If you like the AW dice and 3 outcomes, then once you use that to handle Approaches, you're pretty much there already, right?  You can write the triggers however you want -- AW-style, as Stephen did, or FAE-style if you prefer that.<br/><br/>Since you expressed some interest in playbook-esque special Moves, perhaps those could basically be Aspects.  Again, write the triggers however you want, but you have some major feature that helps define on your character, and you can roll 2d6 to use it, and you just need to know what good/mixed/bad results get you.<br/><br/>If you're not fond of having to look at "on a 10+, choose 3 of the following"-style outcome lists to see the results of specific Moves, then you can certainly just leave the specifics up to the GM (though I'm not sure what goodness you're keeping from AW; might as well import <a href="http://perilplanet.com/fu-rpg/" rel="nofollow">FU RPG</a> instead).  If you don't mind those lists, but just want to keep them GM-facing, that sounds good to me; you can either design some Aspects complete with outcome lists, or design a system for groups to create their own outcome lists based on the Aspects once they've been created.  You could even refer to AW's basic moves for "this general type of Aspect should have this general type of outcome list".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Inanimate" title="Inanimate"><img alt="Inanimate" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/975/nEQWQKRE3OJ64.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Inanimate">Inanimate</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442932/#Comment_442932" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-16T06:51:39+00:00" title="February 16, 2015  6:51AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some random, ill-thought-out ideas on finding a balance between playbooks and approaches:<br/><br/>"Mini-playbooks" that represent Approaches<br/>Approaches are the Basic Moves (I agree this is an interesting idea)<br/>"Playcards" associated with broad categories of Aspects, with lists of Moves you can do using that Aspect<br/>"Modular" Moves that combine Approach&amp;Aspect to equal Trigger&amp;Outcome                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442945/#Comment_442945" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-16T16:31:45+00:00" title="February 16, 2015  4:31PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like to take up David Berg's idea of using <i>FU RPG</i>:<br/>If you want to really want to strip down the AW playbook style and just want the "AW 7-9 feeling", using the FU RPG style dice along with FAE style approaches might be a good solution, indeed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
