I'm looking for feedback in the concept, possible mechanics ideas, setting material, and thoughts on how best to make a game like this GM-less. I'm reproducing the full text of my post on my website. Thanks, in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b><i>Terrorform (tentative)</i></b><br/>\n<br/>\n<b>General Concept</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThe Earth? It\u2019s fucked. We\u2019ve ruined it. The environment outside of the domes is so toxic that walking outside of them for more than a few moments is certain death. The Collective (the world government established in the early part of the 2050s) has made a decision that will save things. If not for us, then for our descendants.<br/>\n<br/>\nTerraforming.<br/>\n<br/>\nSure, it\u2019s been talked about for other planets, and the Mars colonies want to get in on it, but what\u2019s more important than Earth? Our home? Nothing, that\u2019s what. The Earth will be saved, no matter the price that needs to be paid. We\u2019re leaving. Orbital colonies have been built, our homes for the next hundred years or so. We\u2019ll live there, and our children\u2019s children will eventually go back home, to a fresh Earth. We\u2019ll fix our mistakes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>The Hook</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThis game isn\u2019t about living a cushy life on an orbital colony while a bunch of pie-fingering bureaucrats try to salvage what\u2019s left of their dignity by working to fix the unfixable. This game is about the people who couldn\u2019t make it to those colonies. What, you thought this pie-in-the-sky plan accounted for every living human on Earth? Not even close. Not by a long shot. Not even the domes could hold everyone, so what makes you think   the ships to the colonies would be able to? Pipe dream.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey\u2019re going to leave, abandoning decades of infrastructure.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey\u2019re going to send their machines, hit a rest switch.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey\u2019re going to re-seed, replenish.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey\u2019re going to nurture, accelerating evolution.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, they\u2019re going to come \u201chome.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what\u2019s going to be waiting for them when they come back?<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>The Gameplay</b><br/>\n<br/>\nRather than look at a traditional post-apocalyptic game experience, with this game, I want to explore what happens across generations of in-game characters. Sure, you start as one of the Forgotten, the left-behind. But what happens when all that was is breaking down and free for the taking? What happens to your children when the machines come, seeking to scour clean the ruins of what was? What happens to your grand-children when the seeding begins, and the building blocks of life are tossed around like so many children\u2019s toys? And what about their children? What will life look like when the world is growing around them at a rate that beggars the imagination? How will they grow? Finally, Homecoming. What will await your  former kinsmen when they return to the world they think is waiting for them with open arms?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I think I want to see is a few game sessions (minimum one, maximum somewhere around five) exploring each generation of the Forgotten. I don\u2019t really have more specifics than that, but what I\u2019m bouncing around right now includes the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n[ulist]<br/>\n[*]A list of starting areas/biomes, from which you can determine general starting skillsets and flaws<br/>\n[*]Mutations/changes that will affect the second generation based on the things interacted with during the chaos of the colonists\u2019 departure<br/>\n[*]A list of terraforming techniques that could be used, each with different implications (this will take a lot of research)<br/>\n[*]Changes wrought to the next generation based on that terraforming technique chosen and character decisons<br/>\n[*]A radical set of changes based on the seeding process<br/>\n[*]The implications/effects of the super-evolution process<br/>\n[*]Finally, a set of scenarios dealing with the Homecoming<br/>\n[/ulist]<br/>\nI\u2019ve also had these images open in a tab on my laptop for a couple of weeks, now. They may end up having nothing to do with this game, but I\u2019m really interested in the implications of it them terms of spaces of player control:<br/>\n<img alt="5-VD-ellipses-colour.gif" class="bbcode_img" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8590934/5-VD-ellipses-colour.gif"/><br/>\n<img alt="5-VD-ellipses-labelled.gif" class="bbcode_img" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8590934/5-VD-ellipses-labelled.gif"/><br/>\n<br/>\nRight now, I\u2019m considering trying to make this game a GM-less game. Imagine being a group of survivors, thrown together who have to make the best of a situation. A few sessions there, then you play your own (or someone else\u2019s) children. And so on. As well, I\u2019m firmly thinking that the later generations, especially the final generation, will not be properly human any more. By the time the fifth generation is reached, I want the colonists coming \u201chome\u201d to be seen as invaders, as different, as other. How you approach them is up to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've got a lot of work to do, but the feedback requested above, or any questions this info raises, would be very helpful.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
