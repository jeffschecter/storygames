You and your friends have been cutting class to sell dope.  The Mexican gang that controls your neighborhood is pressuring you to join, and you\u2019re considering it.  Meanwhile, your brother\u2500the only one you\u2019ve ever really looked up to\u2500is sitting in a county jail cell for armed robbery.<br/><br/>Still, your Urban Outreach mentor, Mr. Jameson, insists that you\u2019ve got some hidden potential.  And he\u2019s right, but in a way that\u2019s nothing like what you could imagine.  He\u2019s been assigned to you by the System to make sure you don\u2019t fall through the cracks, but his true agenda will turn your life upside down.</i><br/><br/>Mentors is a role-playing game for three players.  In this mashup between <i>Finding Forrester</i> and <i>Unbreakable</i>, you\u2019ll discover a youth\u2019s true potential as it is revealed through a Pictionary-like mechanic.</blockquote>\n<a href="http://www.miserytourism.com/mentors/" rel="nofollow">http://www.miserytourism.com/mentors/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375383/#Comment_375383" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T23:00:33+00:00" title="April 30, 2012 11:00PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2012 11:02PM by stefoid.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That looks pretty cool.

What's the intent behind the use of the term here?<br/>3. Why in the examples of play are the players called "Mike, Rudy and Hank" (names which connote whiteness), but the player character is called "Fatimah"? Is this idea of a group of white people gathering around to play characters of colour intentional? Was there any reason not to give one or more of the players a non-white-sounding name?<br/><br/>I am also kind of unsure about the message of a game in which we are encouraged to see social workers as corrupting forces.<br/><br/>I like the Pictionary mechanic, though!

Hank is my nickname, derived from my middle name. Mike is a personal friend. Rudy, obviously, is Rudy. Also, Rudy is black.

That actually means a lot to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  What I was trying to communicate here was sort of "what the character was thinking."  We don't know the example Probationer's race, but from that line, it might be assumed that they don't identify as Hispanic/Mexican (and therefore might be uneasy about "the Mexican gang" trying to recruit them).  Just a way of highlighting some racial tension without actually giving too many details.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  The place is definitely called Inner City for a reason.  When I made this game, I wanted that term to conjure certain images for the reader.  Certainly, I wanted it to cause people to think about the area as being predominantly minority.  I want that kind of knee-jerk reaction.  This game is meant to provoke uneasiness about race and social class, and I think that using a loaded term like "Inner City" encourages people to actually stop and think about the ethnicity of those involved.  Ideally, even though the game does give the option of making the Mentor a relative, it's kind of intended that they be of a different race or social class than the Probationer.  That separates "their world" from the Probationer's even more, and makes the idea of them using the Probationer even more, well, insidious seeming.  In short, the term is there to make people uncomfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  As for the examples in the text, I straight up just used our own testing group for the names, like William said.  Fatimah was my Probationer in one of the games we played.  I'd love to see an all-white group portraying POC characters- I feel like that would make things extra uncomfortable, which as mentioned in #2, is the point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375715/#Comment_375715" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T19:26:17+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  7:26PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Will there be skater punks?   <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FetusCommander" title="FetusCommander"><img alt="FetusCommander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FetusCommander">FetusCommander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375736/#Comment_375736" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T19:46:56+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  7:46PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There will OBVIOUSLY be sk8er punks =D                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whduryea" title="whduryea"><img alt="whduryea" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v220/Nugan/noose755.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whduryea">whduryea</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376930/#Comment_376930" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-07T09:40:35+00:00" title="May  7, 2012  9:40AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thomas,<br/><br/>We had started to have a conversation about race/racism and <i>Mentors</i>.

I think that if people are a bit uncomfortable with the game going in, it will come across in small (or maybe not so small) ways when they play their characters.  I feel that's key to experiencing this game at its fullest; having people in that very particular mindset is (I think) the only way that the interaction between the Mentor and the Probationer will feel like I want it to.  When you play the Probationer, it should feel like you're being condescended to.  When you play the Mentor, you should feel like you're being condescending.  That relationship, involving that kind of "passive," indirect abuse, is what really makes the Mentor a true "villain" in my eyes- not his scheme to take over the world (or whatever).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I think that kind of relationship is somewhat inherent in the source material (movies like "Finding Forrester," "Precious," and "Dangerous Minds" give me that kind of feeling anyway).  Actually that's not entirely true.  I guess the weird feeling I get is more when I hear people talking about those kinds of movies, as opposed to watching the movies themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that make some sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle" title="Alex_Swingle"><img alt="Alex_Swingle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle">Alex_Swingle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380309/#Comment_380309" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-31T00:55:11+00:00" title="May 31, 2012 12:55AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I read this game, I never saw the racism. Maybe it's my ability to not read too much into social ideals (aka, care too much about skin color, since calling someone a different race implies they are a mutation of the original source). I saw this game as a game about manipulation and more importantly, manipulating mailable minds who haven't been trained to see someone's true intentions. To me, this doesn't even need to include race as a possibility for tension, but is totally fine having it in there to inspire people unaware of the game's true intentions. A lot of the games you guys are testing out seemed to be very meta once investigated, and I like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whduryea" title="whduryea"><img alt="whduryea" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v220/Nugan/noose755.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whduryea">whduryea</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380380/#Comment_380380" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-31T17:08:16+00:00" title="May 31, 2012  5:08PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alex Swingle</cite> A lot of the games you guys are testing out seemed to be very meta once investigated, and I like that.</blockquote>\nWe are absolutely guilty of this.<br/><br/>Tomorrow's game will be particularly meta.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380383/#Comment_380383" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-31T18:18:23+00:00" title="May 31, 2012  6:18PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ooooh                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
