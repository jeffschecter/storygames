Laws' GUMSHOE system. It's designed for a fantasy setting. One of the many things I've been struggling with, is the Arcane Magic system. Now, the main premise of the system is: every one of the currently fifteen-odd magic abilities (schools) is treated the same as any other "Active" ability e.g. Athletics. <br/><br/>Just as you'd say: "I'd like to scale that ten foot wall" and the GM first determines whether you are proficient in the right ability, then how hard it would be before finally you make the roll; you might say: "I'd like to destroy that wall" and the GM determines whether you are proficient in the right school, then how hard it would be, then you make your roll (the roll is a bit more complex for Magic abilities but that isn't pertinent).<br/><br/>Here, if successful, just as you might say: "I leap up to grab a few high handholds before lifting my body to a position where I can get my leg on the top of the wall"; you could say "I summon mystical energies by casting brick dust to the wind with a wave of my hand, whispering the arcane treaties of Shatter". But neither are relevant to the mechanics. The system doesn't care what specific spell you're casting (it's built for a setting where there are spells, but as you might imagine, it would work very well in a setting where magic was just a wild force) that's up to the limits of your imagination. All it cares about is generally what that spell does.<br/><br/>Has this sort of system been done before? If so, what was your opinion of it? If not, what do you think of it? Balance etc. etc. isn't what I'm looking for at the moment (I think I've got balance down, it's pretty damn hard to cast any kind of magic in my system) just discussion on the premise.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444217/#Comment_444217" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-18T10:25:23+00:00" title="March 18, 2015 10:25AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everway comes to mind, tricky to understand at first I thought, even though there's so little there.<br/>The Blast spell in Feng Shui is perhaps the opposite, but it's also something cool to look at if this is what you're doing -- a mechanical effect destined to be flavored a thousand ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444232/#Comment_444232" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-18T15:59:53+00:00" title="March 18, 2015  3:59PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2015 4:00PM by WarriorMonk.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If your schools also deal with the player's intention when casting a spell, then it's all good. The main thing for balance is actually just that the result isn't definitive, nor lasts forever nor it's 100% reliable, which can be solved if everything boils down to at least one or two dice rolls.<br/><br/>I mean, if I play a necromancer and try casting a death-ray spell, I expect to outright kill my opponent. That happening every once in a while on the game might be my fun as a player, but as a GM this could be totally fun-killing. For me a good enough compromise is leaving it to the dice and ask the player to get some situational advantage before being able to try it, or maybe condition the casting to a risk for the PCs life. But as a GM, the right way to narrate things when the roll is too low would be something like "you spell works but your timing is a bit off and the enemy avoids it" or "unexpectedly, another creature crosses in the path of your spell and dies"<br/><br/>There are forms of magic that are versatile by nature and logic usually indicate that it may have different aplications that creative players can exploit. For example, if your, say, Water Magic school includes ice magic, it doesn't only give you "ice damage" but depending on how it works it could also trap the opponents and suffocate them. It could be used for bypassing obstacles or to make terrain difficult for the opponents. Mist could be used to get concealment. I can't but remember how D&amp;D "create water" first versions of the spell might be interpreted in a way that allowed the caster to fill the skull of their opponents with water without allowing a save roll.<br/><br/>The concerns about balance mostly go for schools that are way too versatile, allow PCs to bypass way too many obstacles at once (fly, teleport, time manipulation), permits creative uses that break the game/setting for a low cost or no cost at all, or never miss.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Palimpsest" title="Palimpsest"><img alt="Palimpsest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Palimpsest">Palimpsest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444237/#Comment_444237" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-18T18:04:03+00:00" title="March 18, 2015  6:04PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In this case, the schools are divided by effect, rather than anything like element. For example (and to be confusing) one of the schools is called Fire, which is essentially the school of destruction. It would be the school you would likely be looking for in the above example. But I'm fine with there being some overlap to encourage horizontal thinking, for example, you might be able to use the Change (transmutation, transformation) school to transform the wall into something more easily surmountable. Or perhaps even Sky (weather control) to cause a tectonic shift.<br/><br/>But importantly in this system, I also caveat by dividing every ability in the game between Proficient, Learned and Experienced (essentially Skill Level 1 and then +1 for each of Learned and Experienced). If you're only Proficient in Sky, you will not be able to cause a tectonic shift moreover, even if you did, it will likely not to be very healthy for you or anyone who happens to be nearby. Similarly, with only Proficient Change, you would struggle to turn a brick wall into water. You might be able to turn it into something that would be more easily knocked down with a few maul swings though.<br/><br/>Even considering that, to speak in very brief terms about how the mechanic of the roll works: dependent on whether you are in the heat of combat and have time and access to your spellbook and the proper components for casting, you will need 1-3 successes. <br/><br/>Normally, to get 2 successes (which is what's needed the vast majority of the time) on the average roll you have about a 30% chance of success. Pretty crappy. But! You can Spend to increase your odds. Unfortunately, every Spend you make inherently increases the odds of your spell being a miscast (by about 15% each time). If you do roll a miscast, your spell goes off, but you also roll on a miscast table relative to the school you're using to find out what (relatively) awful fate befalls you.<br/><br/>And that's if your GM decides that your spell is the minimum difficulty to cast. Magic is hard to cast in my system. The vast majority of all people are trained to cast magic sitting quietly at a desk with all the components and instructions to hand. This is not a system designed for a world where people encounter problems and go: "I know the answer! Magic!"                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444242/#Comment_444242" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-18T19:18:12+00:00" title="March 18, 2015  7:18PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2015 7:18PM by WarriorMonk.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looks good so far.

By "affordances" I mean what a magical skill can or cannot do, what it does best, what stretches it to its limits, what the scope of the effect or action is, etc.<br/><br/>Conversely, I usually found it easy, almost trivial, to employ magic as a skill or trait in orthodox "conflict resolution" environments a la PTA or Polaris. In such games you set an intent by formal or informal negotiation, then maybe test whether you achieve the desired outcome by some random mechanism, but your chances at it are mostly independent from the details of what's been negotiated. You still need to form a shared picture of what magic affords you to adjudicate leverage - whether a given intent is at least plausible or flatly unreasonable - but for that you need less detailed a picture, compared to adjudicating older style task resolution.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444262/#Comment_444262" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-19T02:20:00+00:00" title="March 19, 2015  2:20AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed, <a href="/forums/profile/Rafu">@Rafu</a>.

You have a limited supply of them, but it's often replenished. So you don't want to use them too much, but when you really want to succeed, you can spend a bunch.<br/><br/>A *magical* attempt is much more flexible fictionally (you don't need the same kind of leverage or positioning to try something), but, depending on the power level of the magic, carries a *minimum cost* in [Action Points]. <br/><br/>For instance, you have "Necromancy (3)". This means that any time you roll Necromancy, it costs you at least 3 Points. (But you can spend as many as you want.)<br/><br/>This means that your necromancer's attempt is almost always successful (3 points is a large bonus to the roll). However, you'll almost never be tempted to use Necromancy unless there's a lot on the line - you have to justify the expenditure of points, after all.<br/><br/>This fits my conception of "magic" pretty well in a "generic, roll-to-succeed" environment. It rarely fails, but you don't use it too often.<br/><br/>However, mechanically, it works the same way as any other roll, and is balanced with any other skill/ability. (I can use Necromancy and spend 5 Points, but if you're using Swordsman and also spent 5 Points, we're on even ground mechanically. Except your sword won't raise the dead, of course.)<br/><br/>* Fictional<br/><br/>Attach important fictional constraints to magic use: <br/><br/>- It takes time and special resources. <br/>- You must bargain with demons or spirits. (e.g. World of Dungeons! Best magic system ever.) <br/>- Every spell you cast ages you 1d6 years. <br/>- You may never repeat the same spell twice. <br/>- Magic draws the attention of ghosts/demons/gods/other magicians.<br/>- Magic is illegal, considered taboo, taints your soul, etc.<br/><br/>This balances its flexibility nicely, even if mechanically there is no difference.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Palimpsest" title="Palimpsest"><img alt="Palimpsest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Palimpsest">Palimpsest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444314/#Comment_444314" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-19T23:18:43+00:00" title="March 19, 2015 11:18PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting idea <a href="/forums/profile/Paul">@Paul</a> T.

This is one of the key elements of the system's general encouragement of horizontal thinking: if you can justify how your knowledge of Geology is helping you climb that wall, I will let you Surge 1 from Geology to help your Athletics roll. <br/><br/>In this case, I'm wondering whether simply restricting the spells to essentially associated Surge pools is a potential solution to the balance problem. Tell me how you are using magic to aid your ability roll and I'll let you Surge from that magic school. You are never asking to cast a spell, you're using a normal ability you have to make an action and can aid that action using magic. <br/><br/>It is a mechanic that thematically evokes the magitech industrial-esque setting I built the system for, one where magic is something very domestic and woven into everyday life about as much as electricity is woven into our lives. But it does cut out the meat of the magic system altogether. I don't know. I am designing it in a modular fashion so perhaps I'll include the major magic system as an optional mechanic. It's already in-part modular because the system is designed to be easily adapted to any post-war setting, so it shouldn't be too hard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
