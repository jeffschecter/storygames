Unfortunately (for me) he wants to discuss this in terms of "brain damage," which I think is a <i>terrible</i> term for such discussions.  So, that's his prerogative, and my prerogative is to defect from that discussion and have a discussion with more value-neutral terms, here.<br/>\n<br/>\nTemple basically pointed out that indie games focus on some of the same things that traditional games focus on (numbers, rules, reward mechanics, etc.) and that because of this shared focus, the conditioning caused by the two "camps" looks pretty much like two sides of the same coin when looked at from a tradition of roleplay (like the Norwegian) which places less emphasis on those elements.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo which I say ... yeah.  True 'dat.  I can certainly apply lessons from champions min-maxing to getting the right set of TSoY Keys, and vice versa.  These are lessons (and expectations) that I learn from many games, and which form a basis for how I look at games in future.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe advantage of this is that these common elements form a useful skill-set which works across a wide variety of the games I enjoy (and many new games that are created with my conditioning in mind).  The disadvantage is that it can sometimes blind me to the possibilities that don't use these skills.  When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy experience is that, as you continue to expose yourself to new things, the skills remain and the blindness passes.  Yeah, I've had times when I was infatuated with numbers and rigid boundaries and all that stuff ... but then I play something freeformy, and I think to myself "Oh yeah ... there's <i>this</i> cool stuff too..." and then for a while I'm all infatuated with freeformy, then I play something rigid and remind myself.  Eventually (I think I'm getting there!) I get to the point where I say "Yeah, these are both tools in my mental catalogue, and I can come into a situation without <i>expecting</i> that one or the other will be the best tool ... I look over what's happening, and choose an appropriate skillset."<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like an unalloyed good thing to me.
