We play silicon shaman and street-speakers who can talk to the spirits that inhabit the infrastructure of the city: the net, the grid, the mains, and so forth.<br/><br/>My character, portmanitou, is a blogging investigative reporter who is out to expose the witch-lawyers who literally steal people's identities. In game, we joked that she's twittering updates on the murder mystery she and her friends are investigating.<br/><br/>So, we are actually in the process of twittering out actual play highlights of Monday's session, in character and vaguely in real-time. Please follow <a href="https://twitter.com/portmanitou" rel="nofollow">@portmanitou</a> in your favorite twitter client and learn of our harrowing adventure over the next couple of days.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
