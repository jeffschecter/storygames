Today, we have numerous groups of hackers distributed about the country, all acquiring software, stripping the protection, and releasing it for free distribution in illegal channels.<br/><br/>In Shadowrun, not only are you mysteriously unable to hax0r nuyen and credsticks, it seems that there are no sources anywhere that offer software for free download.  This is an on-again off-again conversation I've had with an SR GM.  My position is that in a world SATURATED with hackers all software should be effectively free at chargen, possibly excepting the razor-sharp highest dice pool stuff.  His position is "that may be so, but you still have to pay".<br/><br/>Your thoughts!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148494/#Comment_148494" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-05T18:25:37+00:00" title="June  5, 2008  6:25PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's silly?<br/><br/>I mean, yes, attempt at enforcing economics of the thing, blah blah.

Getting a job for a fat pile of tracable cash might be easy, but if you then want to buy guns with it, that's impossible; instead you may have to cut a deal for a (much?) smaller amount of untracable cash in order to later use for illegal gear.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Veav</cite>My position is that in a world SATURATED with hackers all software should be effectively free at chargen, possibly excepting the razor-sharp highest dice pool stuff.</blockquote>\nI agree with the GM. The fun thing will be thinking about what that money/resource pool for buying software represents. It might become an abstraction like a quotient of Time and Money.<br/><br/>Like, "Black Ice 4" might be a program which you effectively wrote yourself from scratch, because you're a fucking genius. The amount you "pay" is the amount that you "would have gotten paid by a legitimate company if you just took that nice job that your mom wanted you to take". Or in a world with hackers and equally effective AI anti-hacking software, it might represent the time sink that it takes to download a free version of some Attack Software, and then go in and re-rig it using again your genius brain in a way so it doesn't resemble the original version anymore; because as soon as the original version hit the streets, ProtecSource released an update to AI firewall/ice routers to block its ports, unravel its code, ignore it, etc on high exec systems (but you might be able to still use it out of the box to hack a mom and pop shop or a university). So you have the benefit of the 2 million skillful lines of hacker code that tunnels around ice in new ways, but you have to spend a lot of time (represented abstractly by Program Cost) recoding it so that it doesn't get auto-rejected by any device you connect with. And even then, you probably have to retool it every few weeks to avoid tracking.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tadk</cite>Shadowrun is the future of the<em>80's</em>.

In one of my editions of Cyberpunk back in the day, there was skill chips and cyberized limbs... and if you wanted to buy a computer, you could get one that was SO COMPACT that it could FIT INSIDE A SUITCASE.<br/>It contained (no shit!) a FAX MACHINE, and a MODEM CRADLE for dropping a phone headset in and zipping across the wires at stunning speed (they didn't say how fast, but I like to joke 300 baud like the old Atari PC).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/netwomble" title="netwomble"><img alt="netwomble" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh6.google.com/netwomble/R5fup6Cz6tI/AAAAAAAABIQ/mSl7x0gzHo0/s144/Womble_logo_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/netwomble">netwomble</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148523/#Comment_148523" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-05T22:10:46+00:00" title="June  5, 2008 10:10PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From the 4th ed Rules:\n<blockquote>Source Code and Piracy<br/><br/>Most legally-purchased programs are sold with built-in copy protection, so that the program cannot easily be duplicated without an access code. Hackers have invented many ways of circumventing these methods, however, to the point where piracy is the rule rather than the exception.<br/><br/>If a character wishes to duplicate a program that is copy-protected, he needs to break the protection.
