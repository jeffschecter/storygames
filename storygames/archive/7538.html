Bear with me.<br/><br/>Crossposted from the Children of Children recruitment and planning thread at RPG.net, concerning a game starring the kids of the Final Act crew.  Added context in <i>italics.</i><br/><br/>"I have drawings of the Pilots, which are awesome, and I will post them as soon as I get a scanner. I'm also doing pics of each pilot with their Anchor - so far I have Ariana <i>(Smith, by Josh)</i> and Casey <i>(Lin, by Keenan), </i>and Archer's next <i>(Archer Lin from the one-shot, all grown up).</i><br/><br/>However, in these drawings, Jon Smith <i>(by Anchor <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, "Nathan Sinclair") </i>is black (well, half black - looks like a young Obama with an "Oh shit I think I am in love with Casey Lin but do not know how to tell her" expression). So is Ariana's Anchor Jessica, for that matter.  <i>(Jon' player's response: "Unacceptable!  ...I demand dreadlocks and shades.")</i><br/><br/>I have 3 questions for you regarding that:<br/><br/>1 - Does this overly boggle your perception of all of them?<br/>2 - At what point did I say that Sara's Anchor was white (or Asian, or Semetic, or Latino?)<br/>3 - You did realize that by nature of the low income prereq, Treasure Island Job Corps <i>(where the game is set)</i> students are mostly black (followed by white and Latino students with a substantial minority of Chinese exchange students)?<br/><br/>For extra credit, state in your own words why absolutely everyone thought that the Innocent Sweetheart template illo represented Sara Smith in particular, or indeed, that Sara was white (I usually have her and Derek explicitly black in the one-shot). <i>(On the other hand, she's explicitly an older version of that girl in this game.)</i> Use examples."<br/><br/>Looking back, I realized that <i>four out of six</i> of Shiro Nezze's illos are of white guys (and that's assuming that the Seasoned Vet is Anna - that illo could either be white or Asian, but because of surname Lin...).<br/><br/>This bothers me a great deal - I mean, statistically, one in six being black is about right, but no Latinos strikes a dissonant chord with me, not to mention that AFAICT the first playtests took place in Oakland, for crissake.<br/><br/>Part of this is a desire to work racial tension into a heavily I Will Not Abandon You game - given that we quickly decided on "Can we build a better civilization?" as a Hope, this felt appropriate.<br/><br/>I've requested, 'frex, that Anna and a Chinese Laura's gang was an ethnic Chinese one for this game's purposes, and that an <i>Eager Young Soldier</i> pilot descended from Laura and Keenan be half-chinese as well so I could play on that.  <br/><br/>Realizing that I had named Keenan's anchor after Yukiko, a crush of mine from elementary school (last name changed to Tendo to protect the innocent), also suggested to me that we could play on Keenan's alleged fixation for Asian women. <br/><br/>Jon Derek Smith is black, her sister is white, and you can beleive that Josh and anchor Nathan's opinions on the matter will come up.<br/><br/>What are your thoughts on this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167391/#Comment_167391" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-06T07:15:04+00:00" title="September  6, 2008  7:15AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What have you got as far as diversity in your player group, then?

Race in gaming is all too often a question of a bunch of middle-class white guys talking about the Other.

Unfortunately, because there's not an illustrated version, all we have are draft illos, where I was trying to get the artist to show race in a few of them more clearly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe draft pilot profile illos are not related the FINAL ACT characters directly: I think that in all cases but Anna's, they work out pretty well (Anna is most definitely *not* a blond) but other pictures could work as well. As far as my own inner world, I've always seen Keenan as black, Anna as first generation Chinese-American, and Josh and Sarah as "can be black or white depending on your play groups' prejudices, assumptions, and where you live." If I were going to commission illos explicitly for the scenario, I'd either have Josh be black and Sarah be white, or have both of them be white.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that's just me.<br/>\n<br/>\nyrs--<br/>\n--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser" title="Elliott Belser"><img alt="Elliott Belser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser">Elliott Belser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167428/#Comment_167428" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-06T14:58:18+00:00" title="September  6, 2008  2:58PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting...  <br/><br/>Generally, I have the Smiths as Black, Josh as generic White Guy, Keenan as explicitly of Irish descent, and Anna as either first or second gen Chinese as strikes my fancy.  The Anchors are, of course, are shuffled according to the childhoods of the players; if I need to define them for some reason ("...I didn't start thinking about anyone that way until I was 20, and we still know each other!"), Anchor # 1 is Yukiko Tsudonimu (Nisei, Kind) ~_^ Anchor 2# is Nathan Totalfabrication (Black or third-gen Russian Jewish as needed, Driven), and Meredith Makinthisup (Originally a white redhead, but occasionally black: Kind).<br/><br/>I'd honestly have Josh as black and Sara as white myself, except that at Job Corps, this opens up a can of worms that would seriously tempt me to play it No One Gets Hurt - which is categorically Doin' It Wrong with a game about horrible nightmarish aliens, Lord-Of-The-Flies behavior and other things that make Sara cry. <br/><br/>I'm actually a semi-pro artist, so if you'd like to commision some illos from me that, ah, <i>reflect</i> your original intentions, I'd be more than happy.  Email me at BlissAuthority@gmail for rates - I'm just starting out, so it's relatively cheap.  I've posted example illos at the Children of Children recruitment thread at RPG.net.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
