Video game designers specifically. They've got a historical familiarity with D&amp;D. They have a love and passion for games and unwrapping new game designs.<br/><br/>We've been talking about running a game during lunch at work.  When we do, it's clear that although they know the intricacies of Portal 1 and 2's level design or can dissect Braid's time bending gameplay, they have a hard time groking the idea that character stats don't always involved Strength and Hit Points.<br/><br/>I'm leaning towards FATE. It's fairly traditional in the way players need to interact with the game. I've run it before in a work setting, so I know I can fit sessions into a 1 hour lunch format. I'm tempted to do In A Wicked Age or something else lighter than even FATE.  One idea we were talking about for the subject of the game is a team of priests who commit suicide in order to get sent to hell so they can kill Satan. Dante's Inferno meets Inglourious Basterds. Just to give you an idea of the tone. These guys aren't stuck in D&amp;D fantasy (in fact they all agreed they DO NOT want anything close to Tolkeinesque). <br/><br/>If the above helps you focus some game suggestions, great. I want to expand their minds with cool game designs more than having suggestions fit any specific criteria on my end.<br/><br/>I want to know what's out there in the past couple of years (let's say about 2008 and on). What is the best of breed of story game mechanics?  Are there games that you've been surprised how easily non-RPG gamers take to them (or surprised by how much they don't)?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343656/#Comment_343656" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-22T18:10:30+00:00" title="September 22, 2011  6:10PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The hot ticket at the moment is Lumpley Games' <i>Apocalypse World,</i> it seems.

I used to stereotype programmers and mathy people, assuming that more freeform stuff wouldn't be their cup of tea - even though I am one and it's my cup of tea - and over the last year or so have been continually surprised by how many engineers and mathy designers actually totally dig this kind of play.

Even better, play 2 different playsets in one day.<br/><br/>Cause Fiasco is structured, but structured in a totally different way from how they would expect. It'll blow their minds. But Fiasco doesn't seem to lend itself well to being sliced into 50 minute chunks. At least not for people new to the hobby.<br/><br/>From there, they'll be prepped to carry that awesome new mindset into the short form lunchtime sessions.<br/><br/>Otherwise, it would probably take them a lot longer to get their head around the playstyle you're hoping to introduce them to. Based on your descriptions, I'd expect them to bring in more of a trad-style playstyle at first and take a while to open up to other stuff.<br/><br/>I think you'd get a lot of mileage out of taking them through a storygame boot camp on a weekend, and then going from there. Heck, you might throw in a few shorter funky games like Happy Birthday, Robot or Breaking the Ice. Ones that go fast and give them a brief taste of the amazing breadth of what's out there.<br/><br/>Might not be feasible. I get it. I know game developers tend to work crazy long weeks and have limited weekend time available to begin with.

Pregen characters and starting scenario make for easy prep and explanation, but wildly open-ended possibilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nI truly love Apocalypse World, and I think it would really appeal to the type of gamer you describe, but it works best when you know you'll continue playing.  Don't get me wrong - the first session is always an absolute blast that gets its hooks in ya, but AW is at its best as a serial.  I think it would be a big hit, though, if you can get the players on board.  There are stats and mechanics that they can hold onto, but everything is ruled by the narrative.  If you think fantasy would appeal more, Dungeon World seems equally beloved, although I haven't tried it yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343752/#Comment_343752" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-23T13:10:40+00:00" title="September 23, 2011  1:10PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>The Shadow of Yesterday is the game I'd recommend.</blockquote>\nOh shit, yes.

Good mix of rules and creativity, and they can make it as silly or serious as they want (they say they don't want a straight out comedy game, so no Labyrinths and Lycanthropes, but I expect dick and fart jokes to make cameos by them still).<br/><br/>I'm skipping Burning Wheel because it's too crunchy for me, and D&amp;D because it's not break away enough (some of them have already played 4th also).

Most of mine are taken up by either a regular game or various other activities.  <br/><br/>However, I considered Fiasco (I thought maybe play could aim to break each half of the play set down to around an hour, though that could be pushing it), but the heavy lifting needed from players for scene framing also seems like a bit much. Could I be wrong? I just know from my experience I was paralyzed with a lack of ideas for most of the first half of the game, and was only helped by very outgoing and experienced players at the table.

InSpectres, for instance.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343783/#Comment_343783" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-23T17:39:00+00:00" title="September 23, 2011  5:39PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I'm feeling that John.  I am not planning to start a campaign, but I do expect multi-session play though, because even the quickest game I was thinking of (In A Wicked Age ~2 hours)* would need to happen over a couple of lunches - unless I really accelerate the pace of chapters (which I'm tempted by, but I think that will be too quick). Most RPG "single session" stories would be 3-4 weeks at best.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343797/#Comment_343797" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-23T20:34:30+00:00" title="September 23, 2011  8:34PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John has it: my experience is that with new people you want to play at least one one-shot to begin with. This allows you to gauge the creative interests of the group, enabling you to pick the long(er)-term game better.<br/><br/>To give you an idea that suits my own repertoire, here's how I proceed nowadays if I need to dive in with a new group of people:\n<ol><li>Get together to play <i>Zombie Cinema</i> or similar. The game is short, can be cut short without losing anything important, and is very good for finding out whether the players will like dramatism (roleplaying concerned with dramatic form) and narrativism (moral choices as creative focus of play). Most importantly, the game needs to be socially adaptable and fail gracefully: even if a given player fails to grog the game creatively, he still needs to be able to make a pro forma contribution that allows everybody to walk away without embarrassment.</li><li>Assuming I used ZC as my gauge game above (could do Fiasco, Shab-al-Hiri Roach, Fables of Camelot, Great Orc Gods, whatever as long as it fits the social footprint), I now have a few options after seeing the players in real field conditions:<ul><li>If the group grogged Zombie Cinema and got full use out of it, this indicates that they're willing and interested in playing a game that's mostly about setting up a dramatic situation and then resolving it, entertaining everybody by creative storytelling and thematic content. Primetime Adventures, Mountain Witch, Nine Worlds, In A Wicked Age and many other games are just fine for such a group, so I well might continue with any of those with such a group.</li><li>If the group playing ZC seemed mostly concerned with positioning their own player characters, but still played ball regarding the game's themes, allowing themes to develop and enjoying the climax, then my game choice would be something with a strong GM role. Shadow of Yesterday is an obvious pick, but there's lots of range in this regard. An important question to consider here for me would be whether the group might enjoy a simulationistic game like FATE better than the narrativist stuff I tend to throw; I have a strong hand in horror sim, so I well might float the idea of playing Dread or Dead of Night. Could also do FATE, as mentioned. Most significantly, if they'd take Horror voluntarily, we could do a session of Dead of Night just to enable me to gauge this sim/nar thing more closely; ZC alone isn't really enough for me to peg people this closely.</li><li>If the group didn't grog the dramatic ideas in Zombie Cinema, but merely played maneuver games against zombies in deep immersion, then I well might float D&amp;D as the next game. OSR D&amp;D could easily be played for 2-3 sessions, after which I'd know a lot more about the gam/sim lean and how the players feel about character ownership.</li></ul></li><li>After the second stage I should know the new group well enough to have some genuine detail about the guys: who's a Lovecraft fan, who digs anime, who's only there for the company, who's open to anything and adaptable, that sort of thing. This is when we also start pruning the crew, hand-picking the players for more challenging and specific games.</li></ol>\nI wouldn't suggest the above for others, it's just illustrative of my train of thought when starting up with new players. The main thing to take from it is the idea that you should make your first game short and finite so as to be able to stand back from it as a group and ask the others what they thought about it. It's a very good place to be socially when you can look back on a successful or even passable rpg session and ask the guys what they liked or didn't like about it. That's when you can drop a few options on them and get them to contribute in picking the next game, for instance. Starting a long game immediately has a weakness in that you'll be playing it for so long that it's practically assured that the game will peter out or players will drop out long before you get a moment for reflection and completely new direction (meaning, a new game).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
