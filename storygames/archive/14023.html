It turns out it's very hard to satisfy all those desires (read: I've never seen it done effectively).</p>\n<p>I don't understand why people keep saying "zombie". I don't infer any zombies from your setting, and zombies are boring anyway. They look like people, but aren't, so you get the fun of shooting a person without the moral question.</p>\n<p>Instead, what you have here is a huge natural disaster. How do people act during natural disasters? You might want to as the players that: ask them what their characters do. Do they make family communities and hole up, hoarding iodine and water? Do they join together the best minds of their generation to build a sun-starter?</p>\n<p>Some fun science to play with:</p>\n<p>What you're talking about with Jupiter is a <em>brown dwarf</em>. Jupiter is about 1/15th the mass of a brown dwarf, so it means that someone learned how to generate a <em>lot</em> lof mass. In order for it to ignite, it would need 60-80 x what it currently has. So let's say that the engineers learned how to generate mass and managed to get Jupiter to 60x, which they figured would be enough, but it just made this brown dwarf instead. Anyone wanting to increase it to real star level will have to push it past a thresholds by adding multiple Jupiters to the equation. Maybe it so happens that the threshold is really close \u2014\xa0Uranus and Saturn together come close to one Jupiter mass.</p>\n<p>Let's talk about how you can "make" mass. Because if people can make multiple Jupiters, the kinds of technologies in the world are going to be a long way from shotguns and wide automobiles. You're talking about a major effect that would literally move the entire solar system.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>You could borrow it from the sun</strong> \u2014 some sort of giant particle ray that funnels sun into Jupiter. Thats a stream I wouldn't want to cross. You could have an array of mass pumps in solar orbit, shooting stuff to Jupiter. I can't conceivably calculate the amount of time this would take, but for the sake of human-comprehensible grandiosity, let's say centuries. (I like this idea, by the way. It fits my "plausible but not possible" criteria for big-scale science fiction)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implications:<br>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Energy is cheap! We know how to move it around the solar system! Maybe there's a power array around the whole sun that powers all the comet-spacecraft, too.</li>\n<li>Space is <em>even more</em> full of radiation! Crossing those streams in a spacecraft would be like getting microwaved. </li>\n<li>Maybe the pieces of the array are privately owned? Maybe someone decided to start feeding their own purposes instead of feeding Jupiter? That would make the solution sociopolitical instead of technical. I like that, myself.</li>\n</ul></br></br></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p><strong>You could build a wormhole</strong> in the center of Jupiter, connected to some larger mass \u2014\xa0say, another brown dwarf. Wormholes are the kind of theoretical constructs that we like to talk about in science fiction because they don't break any laws of physics, but it's unclear just how one would go about producing black holes, then holding them open at either end. It's fun to think about the implications, and for all we know they can occur naturally, but they rely on making mass, which doesn't resolve our issue. So let's say there's a way to induce it to happen naturally that we won't explain.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implications:<br>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>You can build wormholes! Maybe it's a big deal to make one so you can't do it anytime you want. Maybe Jupiter is the first one. But that means you know how to travel the stars! ... if you can just get people to agree to build another one, since the first one was such a disaster. </li>\n</ul></br></br></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p><strong>You can "make mass".</strong> If you can make it up from nothing, the whole universe doesn't make sense, so let's say you have to make it from energy. Converting energy to mass is something we don't know how to do, but can apparently do.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implications:<br>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>On a small scale, you can have artificial gravity, which means, if nothing else, you control your comet-ships by making them <em>fall</em> the direction you want. That's pretty neat. It might also be the kind of thing that you don't control from within the comet itself; maybe they're like elevators: you tell it where you want to go, it tells the machine where it wants to go, and the machine pulls you to it.</li>\n<li>Maybe the big issue on Mars is keeping the gravity generators working so supplies and help can come from Earth. Maybe one clan controls the gravity generators while another controls communication with Earth and they're in a disagreement about who gets first pick of the Martian goat herd each year.</li>\n<li>You can teleport at the speed of light, at least theoretically! You can make objects out of sunlight! You don't have an economy at all!</li>\n</ul></br></br></li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p>What I'm proposing is that you consider the implications that such a huge event would have, then figure out what the human interests are in that event. As the players, well before play:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What does your character want?</li>\n<li>Who does you character know? Family? Political Allies? Just one or two.</li>\n<li>What does each of those characters want in a sentence?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Take a look at everything they've given you and figure out what characters want things that are incompatible with what the characters want.</p>\n<p>That's where the action will happen. No zombies required.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317710/#Comment_317710" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-24T15:21:42+00:00" title="March 24, 2011  3:21PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 24, 2011 3:22PM by Paul88.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the feed back, Maybe I could have headed this post <b>Finding the Drama in my game</b> ?<br/>\n<br/>\nJoshua  the social political solution I like, the particle array sounds great, might fit in a treat.<br/>\nIn the game Gravity is created by using nuclear energy but this is Ok for local areas like spaceship gravity or land travel.<br/>\nYour idea <b>You could borrow it from the sun</b> is used for larger areas like Comets? and or turning Jupiter into a Sun.<br/>\nThe initial Gav-bomb sets up a ignition spike which then needs feeding by the particle array, sorted!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game as it stands has a Technical solution which seems boring.
