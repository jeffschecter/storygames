Game groups, especially long term ones, are much bigger, more complex, and more resilient than any mere ruleset they can be.

It gives a wrong vibe on how you value other people, or at least does looking from this side of the language barrier -correct me if I'm wrong.<br/><br/>Otherwise I'm so glad to see this written. I've been feeling for years that there was something quite inefficient on, as a designer, giving the readers advice on how to run your game outside the rules chapters of the book. The procedures and phrases the designer uses to run the game are as much important to me as the actual rules to know how it's meant to be understood and run. <br/><br/>I loved how exact ritual phrases from the designers helped more than their explications to understand how their games are meant to be run, and loved even more when those phrases were a hard component of the system instead of an advice on how to run it.<br/><br/>I felt the same when I had to read tons of advice in order to learn how to actually run a game right, or how it is that you only get system mastery when you have learned not only a big chunk of the game rules but a big chunk of your group ritual phrases to trigger things, as well as when to apply them.<br/><br/>Thus, no wonder some people have a harder time with some games at the start but then things click when they try different things, read comments or just see it from a different point of view. It took me years to finally get the basics behind PbtA games, basically until I read World of Dungeons and a manual to understand Dungeon World. The hardest thing for me to get was how was the GM was meant to run the thing without rolling dice, until I understood that the idea was that only when the players failed a roll was that bad things started to happen; and then, they happened in two stages at least: a threat, and when the reaction to that threat failed, a consequence.<br/><br/>However in general terms this would mean that designing a game is an exercise in convincing other people to change their ways, something so akin to railroading and control that no wonder people often dislike this approach to game design and keep telling me that advice is okay, that you can't force people into playing your game the way you want them to play it and that doing so is disrespectful to the reader. Subconsciously anyone will object to any form of coercion.<br/><br/>So basically rulebooks are being written in the right politically correct way now and that does not need to change, nor it's actually an improvement to design them with this particular frame of mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464763/#Comment_464763" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-12T06:15:38+00:00" title="July 12, 2017  6:15AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess you're right about the job thing; just hit close to home I guess.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464764/#Comment_464764" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-12T06:25:24+00:00" title="July 12, 2017  6:25AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Update \u2014 in response to questions on other fora, I've put up <a href="https://mhuthulan.wordpress.com/2017/07/12/some-meanings-of-some-terms/" rel="nofollow">a new post with some definitions</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464765/#Comment_464765" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-12T06:29:49+00:00" title="July 12, 2017  6:29AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 12, 2017 12:16PM by Rob_Alexander.">edited July 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" rel="nofollow">WarriorMonk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Not so keen on the lower-status-job thing.

Heck, we even have a guy who works for the government here, probably does ten times my monthly wage and he doesn't look down on us neither. At least nobody does when it comes to anything outside our lines of work. Perhaps it has more to do with our social contract, as a general rule we have always dissociated the social status/job of the GM from their authority at the table. Probably it's just us then.<br/><br/>Anyway, nature always follows the path of least resistance, which explains why designing by following that path will create a game that would be the perfect fit for the target group you've got in mind/play most often with. When hacking stuff for my group this has been the tendency, so we will probably end up with a few different games that employ a mix of the mechanics we've had most fun with. It's a never ending process though, since we will most probably try some new thing in the way that will introduce new variables in the equation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464773/#Comment_464773" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-12T17:58:41+00:00" title="July 12, 2017  5:58PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/paganini" rel="nofollow">paganini</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/><a href="http://lumpley.com/index.php/anyway/thread/360" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://lumpley.com/index.php/anyway/thread/360</a><br/><br/>This post from 2008 grew out of the thinking you mentioned in your footnote. <br/></p></div></blockquote>\nThanks \u2014 that's relevant.<br/><br/>Another very relevant post on Anyway is <a href="http://lumpley.com/index.php/anyway/thread/23" rel="nofollow">Periodic Refresher</a> from June 2005.

Statements like:<br/><br/>- You should just fudge the results.<br/>- Ignore the rules if you need to!<br/><br/>And a widespread culture of kitbashing which is not <i>inherently</i> problematic, but does get weird when people start radically houseruling a system before they've even played it... often to make it look just like every other RPG they've played. (For example, I had a discussion with a guy who said he didn't enjoy playing Numenera: Before play he'd decided he didn't like the point spend mechanic for resolving skill checks; didn't like XP spends for effect; and didn't like GM Intrusions so he didn't use any of those mechanics. He also radically revamped the central Effort mechanic worked in the game. Nothing inherently wrong with doing that, but he never actually played Numenera.)<br/><br/>As a game designer, I find it incredibly difficult to get meaningful playtest feedback from RPG players because, by and large, <i>none of them are actually playing the game</i><br/><br/>Where I find these memes particularly disturbing is when I encounter them in other <i>designers</i>: People who are ostensibly designing robust rules for other people to use, but in whom the response to "just fudge around it" has become so ingrained that they do it while playtesting their own games instead of recognizing mechanical failures and figuring out how to <i>fix</i> them.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464815/#Comment_464815" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-15T16:36:56+00:00" title="July 15, 2017  4:36PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/JustinA">@JustinA</a> I've seen the same things you have.  My takeaways are that sometimes it's easier to connect with an RPG audience by designing things other than rules; and that when it comes to rules design, hooking the players into actually using them is part of the design challenge.  Personally, I don't pick up games in the first place if their rules don't inspire me to use them more or less as written, so honestly I'd simply feel grateful if someone ignored my rules but wanted to play my game anyway for something else that it offered.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465158/#Comment_465158" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-30T11:15:03+00:00" title="July 30, 2017 11:15AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 30, 2017 11:15AM by Rickard.">edited July 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was going to protest, and say that a good system forms what people talk about, but reading the blog made me realize that you're actually talk about something else. That people bring their own conventions about roleplaying games into a game system, no matter what the game system says.<br/><br/>Some experiences from my side, and this has happened to me several times.<br/><br/>- People not reading all the rules, because "they know how to play roleplaying games".<br/><br/>- People saying "This is not an RPG" if it doesn't fit their way of playing.<br/><br/>- Masses and masses of people not reading game advice. I agree with <a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a> here. It's wack design to even include game advice. Robin D Laws has got it right, where he turns game advice into rules (Not rolling for investigator skill is a disguised game advice for never allow randomness to decide if players get clues or not.)<br/><br/>- People starting to act out in characters, even if it doesn't say so in the text - and even if it's not labeled as a roleplaying game - because the game resembles a roleplaying game.<br/><br/>One way, and it's a shame that it's not translated into English, is to acknowledge that. This is why I say that <b>Oktoberlandet</b> is probably the best written game that exists, because the information in that book gets different meaning depending on how the reader interprets the text. This goes with both the setting and the game advice (yep, it has game advice, but it's the text that is best written, it's not best designed).<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>But on the other hand. People don't sit down at a <b>Once Upon a Time</b> game and expects chess. I believe, that if roleplaying games were better at actually telling people what the game is about, then people would go in to the game with new eyes. However, and I know this from experience as well, people tend to fall back on old tracks after a few sessions if "the new way of playing" isn't constantly reinforced.<br/><br/>But right now, there is only "roleplaying games" and people instantly think that it means the same to everybody, when some people think ", some " and some "tabletop roleplaying games". And I bet you thought the difference would be "Story Games, traditional games, railroading" or something else. This is why I'm having trouble with Ben Robbin's games, even if I love how different the playstyle is, because they don't tell me how I should enjoy them. The exact same trouble has all Forge games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465166/#Comment_465166" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-30T18:36:37+00:00" title="July 30, 2017  6:36PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If a ruleset is an intervention, I'm becoming convinced it's a terribly half-assed intervention delivered over maybe the worst possible medium.<br/><br/>Someone's used to playing <i>that</i> way, and you want them to play <i>this</i> way. You codify as much of <i>this</i> way as you can in rules, write it down, and send it over.<br/><br/>You've got two problems right off the bat:<br/><br/>First, the rules you wrote down, and even the advice you wrote along with it, are, like, only a small fraction of what you need to play <i>this</i> way.<br/><br/>Second, they're dead words on paper, and your reader will probably ignore most of them.<br/><br/><small>(I really don't understand the attitude of, "a good rules set will produce the desired play on its own." That's a pipe dream. Even the most virtuous of your rules sets will only produce your desired play when the reader basically already knows how you want them to play and has a strong desire to play that way.)</small><br/><br/>But text is easy to create, and traditional, so we all keep using it, and we all keep thinking that The Text Is The Game. And rules are easy to convey in text\u2014technique and attitude and so on are really terribly hard, in part because people tend to just skip over that bit while reading\u2014so we get this idea that The Game Is The Rules. But that's bullshit, of course, which I guess is the thesis of this thread.<br/><br/>But maybe a a well-crafted ruleset that does the best it can to produce the desired play when someone reads it is a bit like a well-crafted essay that does the best it can to prevent the transmission of STDs when someone reads it.<br/><br/>Well meaning, and not entirely ineffective, but the wrong damn tool for the job.<br/><br/>What's better? The best I can think of is live demonstration, teaching by playing, but that obviously doesn't scale. Youtube video series, maybe. A sort of pyramid scheme of teaching where you train people to play your game, and they train others, and you have a central place where you can all talk about it, maybe. That's all quite a bit harder than writing some words down and clicking "Save as .pdf", though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465201/#Comment_465201" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-31T20:05:13+00:00" title="July 31, 2017  8:05PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We've got to remember that RPGs are a multiple media experience. There are game mechanics, there are ritual and freeform social interactions, there's a fictional world shared mostly orally, and all this without considering using support media like images, sounds and music nor performance arts to transmit the characters emotions or classical poetry/literature-level-like dialogue and descriptions.<br/><br/>Trying to explain how all the simultaneously-moving parts work using just text is of course the less efficient way, beaten justly by learning while playing. You could say that video is the second best way to explain it, followed by audio, comics/flux diagrams, then actual play and finally explaining everything in written form. However I'd say that perhaps each part could be better explained in their native media. <br/><br/>You would end up with something like a core game document made in mixed media, with written mechanics/flux diagrams that include video links of actual play with real people with some scenes in comic book format to explain what's happening in the fictional world. Then you could print the mechanics for quick in-game reference once you have understood how everything works by watching the video.<br/><br/>The part with real people playing would help a lot to get players assimilate easily how are ritual phrases supposed to work and identify when those and the mechanics should be used -as well as the tone of voice and gestures that accompany them for best effect. This is where the spirit of how are the fictional elements negotiated is learned by the players. <br/><br/>The comic-book part would be there for marking the difference between the real world and the shared imagined world, where immersion rules and mechanics as well as social real-world negotiations are meant to be unobstrusive, and explaining what goes there as a reflection of how and when are the mechanics implemented and the results of the fiction being negotiated by the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465220/#Comment_465220" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-01T00:17:50+00:00" title="August  1, 2017 12:17AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it would be pretty interesting to make a video of actual play... with the option to hit "pause" at any time, which reveals a bunch of text explaining what's going on in more depth.<br/><br/>"The trap activates! A blade is swinging towards you. What do you do?"<br/><br/>If you pause (or mouseover or whatever other way), this text balloon appears:\n<blockquote><br/>[The player is facing a dangerous situation, which are common in dungeon exploration - indeed, dungeons are often full of traps, dangerous environments, and hostile creatures, even when it strains verisimilitude [...] The trap activates here because of the player's failed roll earlier. However, in (name of game) the players always get a final chance to avoid danger. This is why Raquel (the GM) has only described the action as a threat in motion and then asks the player what she wishes to do about it. Lisa (the player) has the following options: * Rely on a Saving Throw roll * Use an instant magic effect * [Etc...]<br/><br/>The text could be hyperlinked to explain rules like Saving Throws, and, once you "dismiss" it, play resumes.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465231/#Comment_465231" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-01T14:28:31+00:00" title="August  1, 2017  2:28PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 1, 2017 2:32PM by WarriorMonk.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent! That's the thing, once you start thinking on how to make mixed media work, ideas start to pop up by themselves and the whole deal seems easier to explain. You could show the same video and have different captions for the players and for the GM, so the GM also gets to learn how to react, when and how to implement the rules and when let action, narration or the players guide the course of the game.<br/><br/>The next challenge is to find out the cheapest way to produce all that though. No wonder most designers rely on text though, video production and art prices depend on quality, though thanks to technology some cheap options have become available. There is free software to edit video, cheap cameras and tons of tutorials for anyone who wants to learn.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
