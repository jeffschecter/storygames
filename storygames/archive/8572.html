No, this isn't the one I wrote about a few months ago. That crashed and burned for a variety of reasons. This is brand new and potentially may lead to something being published.<br/><br/><b><i>Nota bene: </i> I will steal your ideas. If you post really cool things in this thread, I reserve the right to steal them, twist them, and use them in my setting, and that includes selling it and making money and not paying you anything for it. Seriously.</b> But if I think your idea is <i>brilliant</i>, I might work something out with you and have <i>you</i> write it, then pay you typical, lame-ass game-author rates for your work.<br/><br/>I felt that disclaimer was necessary. I really don't want to steal people's ideas, but I also don't want people yelling at me, "You stole my idea!" when I do publish this thing. I'll do my best to credit everyone's ideas in the colophon, okay? I don't want to be a dick. <br/><br/><br/><b>Concept</b><br/><br/>"Points of light" in a city. High fantasy with horror and post-apocalyptic themes.<br/><br/>A city from a non-magical late-medieval world somehow ends up in the middle of a high-fantasy jungle world. A small number of the city's original inhabitants develop magical powers and transform in weird ways. The magical jungle devours the city streets. Monsters of every type invade every shop, apartment, and alley. The heroes must help their fellow citizens survive in this terrible, monstrous world. <br/><br/>Verothi was a booming city. Situated at the junction of three rivers and several trading routes, the metropolis was the home of the Hathnian Kingdom's palatial seat, a college of science and the arts, numerous grand guild halls, and fifty thousand people. The citizens ranged from the queen and her court to nobility to rich tradesmen -- and so on and so forth -- all the way down to the lowest beggars.<br/><br/>One night, the world blinked, and Verothi found itself in a different universe. Farms used to stretch out to the horizon from the city's walls. Now dense jungle pushed up around the defenses. The city streets, before kept in order by regular patrols, now filled with monsters of a kind only mentioned in faery tales. Most everyone died within a few weeks. Indescribable things scaled the walls -- or flew right in -- and devoured people. Nightmarish beasts crawled up out of the sewers to murder people in their homes, or worse, drag them down into who-knows-where. The survivors holed up in safe places, hoarded food and water, and tried to stay alive.<br/><br/>Two months after the city displaced, it got a new wall made of magical force. Of course, no one from the city had ever seen anything like it. No one knew who had created the barrier. Was it meant to keep the people in, or keep monsters out? In any case, it seemed impenetrable.<br/><br/>Some of the inhabitants began changing. They developed magical powers for fighting and healing and for understanding the magic that weaves the world together. Some of these people devoted their power for the cause of good. They helped people where they could, bringing food and supplies to the needy. Others turned their abilities toward evil. <br/><br/>This is the metrocalypse we live in. The way home is uncertain. There are still monstrous things here, some of them us.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189973/#Comment_189973" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-26T07:54:35+00:00" title="January 26, 2009  7:54AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Product</b><br/><br/>For now, this is just something I'm gonna run for some friends. Reaction to these setting ideas so far seems to be divided into the "okay, fine, whatever" camp and the "oh my god, I want this now" camp. That leads me to believe that there's a market for this, so I am developing it with an eye towards eventual publication.<br/><br/>I envision the setting as a series of PDF products. There will be a core setting product that describes the city and situation at a high level and gives advice for making characters that live in this setting. I imagine that's free. Yes, FREE. If a DM wants to download that and make her own stuff for that setting, good on her. Then I will support that core setting idea with additional products. These are things you could plug into other settings with a little work, so they're not just Transit things. Small location-based adventures in the city. New monsters from the jungle. New powers and feats with a Transit flare.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189976/#Comment_189976" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-26T08:05:40+00:00" title="January 26, 2009  8:05AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Verothi</b><br/><br/>So imagine the city of Verothi as a typical river town in Sixteenth Century Italy or Germany or something. The architecture is a mix of creepy Gothic stuff and Classical styles. There are markets and shops and apartments and houses. Most of the thing is walled up. There's a palace and some temples. The people there are pious but they never see real magic. Life centers on commerce, craft, and service. A poorly-organized Guard maintains order and collects tolls at the gates.<br/><br/>Suddenly, there's an earthquake and a flash of weird light. That day, weird monsters start roaming the street. It turns into some kind of zombie apocalypse, but with unspeakably weird creatures hunting people instead of mindless undead. Every day, the jungle itself eats another city block. The vines grow over the walls overnight and start filling the cobblestone streets with tall plants, chokers and creepers, nettles, and sometimes man-eating plants. The city itself is unsafe for travel. <br/><br/>People huddle in small groups in safe buildings, but there's no food. People have to go out to hunt for supplies. Most never return. Sometimes the monsters break down the doors and feed on the citizens.<br/><br/>The city is transformed. A flight of dragons makes a new nest in the palace on the hill. The once-beautiful hanging gardens become home to harpies. Strange and malicious brownies move into apartments and rifle through shops for trade items. Every day, new, weird monsters appear.<br/><br/>One day, a shimmering globe pops into existence around the city. It seems to stop more monsters from coming into the city. It also seems to keep the city's populace from leaving. Still, it doesn't eradicate Verothi's pestilence of evil and cunning magical beasts. Who created the barrier? Whom is it meant to protect?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189978/#Comment_189978" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-26T08:11:53+00:00" title="January 26, 2009  8:11AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Characters</b><br/><br/>When you make a character for Transit, you make a normal D&amp;D character.

Others transform more dramatically. They polymorph into different shapes (races), some as strange as the "dragonborn," who weren't actually <i>born</i> with a dragon form...<br/><br/>Creating a character for this setting requires you to think about who you were before the change, who you've become since, and how you deal with it. <br/><br/>More on the <a href="http://transit.legendary.org/index.php/Creating_Characters" rel="nofollow">Creating Characters for Transit</a> page on my wiki.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189979/#Comment_189979" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-26T08:12:18+00:00" title="January 26, 2009  8:12AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>What I'm looking for, here</b><br/><br/>If you want to share ideas, awesome.

I've been thinking about this because I'm working on a Shang Dynasty-inspired thing for D&amp;D4, based on some of the ideas we put forward in Hard Boiled Cultures and have been trying to decide if there's a One Bad Egg product in there somewhere.  And my conclusion is like, maybe?  Not because I really think other people want to play in my Shang Dynasty fantasy setting (though they might), but because I think the way I'm implementing the setting in 4E might serve as an inspiration for other folks who want to hack 4E into a more "new school indie gaming" style experience.  So, yeah, while I'd totally love to see what you're doing with Transit City, I'd be interested to steal ideas for implementing them in a setting that I created with my friends here, not because I actually want to play in Transit City.<br/><br/>In my mind, the way most D&amp;D products work is ass-backwards.  What you want, in my mind, is to inspire people to create their own super cool stuff and provide them tools that allow them to do that in a way that is satisfying and effective at the table.  Setting stuff can do this, sure, but, as we've discussed here recently, setting is most inspiring when it's a largely unfilled map that sets out the boundaries of a playground in which players can let their own creations loose.  Sure, it may feel a bit less exciting as a game designer to not have hundreds of folks roaming around an imaginary place that you created, sending you emails because they're demanding that you write a product about secret society XYZ, but, honestly, I think there really is something in teaching folks to fish instead of just selling them fish.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I'm more interested in <i>doing awesome stuff the way that you do awesome stuff</i>, without doing <i>the exact same awesome stuff</i> that you're doing, if that makes sense.

Whats stopping the people, having seen their pious ways get them sent here, going to worship I dont know a dragon. These might be the questions you want to address but that's not post apocolyptic. Post apocolyptic is not about looking before, its about being in the after, being the last men, etc ,etc. <br/><br/>I think you may want apocolyptic more than post apocolyptic. <br/><br/>Idea 2, <br/><br/>I remember reading a scifi/fantasy novel wherein the people had to be good because otherwise they turned into exactly the kind of fantasy monsters that Dnd uses. A murder or rape would result in immediate transformation and smaller things where more gradual. I found it terribly interesting at the time, and you already have the transformation aspect going on to it, you can play this up or down as you please.<br/><br/>Idea 3, <br/><br/>You may want to save some of the phb races for natives of the land, that whole me tarzan you jane thing can be very amusing in its own right. <br/><br/>Idea 4, <br/><br/>If the dome stops people from leaving, how do hunting parties get out, if hunting parties can get out, why dont monsters get in, If they can't why aren't people starving (are the monsters in town edible? Has the population been so reduced that you can survive on whats left? was there much to begin with? how has it been surviving for 2 months in the jungle, (and dont say magic becuase you didn't have magic 2 months ago, that whole magitech is the solution to everything is something i honestly hope you dont do ). Does mana drop from the heavens, and monsters just eat people because they are too dumb to pick it up off the ground. <br/><br/>Idea 5<br/>Where are the points of light again, you said you wanted points of light within a city. That's kewl, but you haven't actually listed any points of light inside the city yet. Is the temple to ( god? )still kicking, do these 16th century, christian folk get the idea taht zombies eat brains and that they are not loved ones who have come to bask in the return of jesus christ. <br/><br/>Would you play this thing?<br/><br/>Sure if someone was willing to run it, and take it easy on the indie stuff. <br/><br/>I surpose the question really is, would i pay money for a pdf of it.

Here are some city locations to drop in. Buy them, use them, abuse them. That's why the core setting PDF is free: you can just riff off it and replace it with your own thing.<br/><br/>The core of this is so simple that anyone can take it and start running games like this. My value-add to the process is some new monsters, locations, and situations that you can drop into your own version of it. And, as you say, "teaching to fish."

Lemme try to address them without cutnpaste madness.<br/><br/>After a week, the city isn't idyllic at all. The streets are clogged with jungle, monsters are hunting people, and some of the people are transforming into magical superheroes. Yes, everyone starts reacting to the metrocalyptic events that occurred! The city changes.<br/><br/>I probably won't save the PHB races for natives. My goal is that any D&amp;D character will fit in this world. Really, the weirder you are, the more you have to role-play about your transformation process, all the while kicking ass and taking names. This is still a typical D&amp;D game with a focus on combat. The backgrounds just offer some grist for the role-playing mill. I do not at all envision this as some kind of hippie-storygaming drift of 4E!<br/><br/>The barrier does stop people from getting out. The hunting occurs in the city. Since the jungle flooded the streets, there's regular fauna and flora for the hunters and gatherers to eat. There's just also, you know, orcs and giant spiders to deal with, too. Yes, the population is reduced almost to nothing. Normal people (assume they are minions, statwise) are no match for monsters. I do see a huge potential for adventure in trying to get out of the city through holes in the barrier (perhaps the barrier doesn't go underground...)<br/><br/>Yeah, there are points of light. You have the gist of it. A secure temple whose gods (or <i>someone</i>) now actually answers prayers. The guard armory. Even an old city block that happens to be pretty defensible, even if it's largely run by the old organized crime syndicate. These are points of light in the city. <br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite><b>Would you play this thing?</b><br/><br/>Sure if someone was willing to run it, and take it easy on the indie stuff.<br/><br/>I surpose the question really is, would i pay money for a pdf of it.

Would you pay a dollar or two for a PDF that detailed a location like the aforementioned temple, or a series of new monsters level 1-5, or interesting villains (statted, of course) who cause trouble in the city? The idea is that each PDF offers a tight, focused look at one thing in the city, with a little prose, a lot of ideas for you to develop yourself, and enough crunch (monsters, magic items, rituals, hazards and traps, skill challenges) to be worth it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189992/#Comment_189992" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-26T09:34:02+00:00" title="January 26, 2009  9:34AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I mostly like it in general, but one thing would make me really seriously consider it:<br/><br/>Survivalists.<br/><br/>No one saw this coming.

I guess I'm not sure what you're meaning for the barrier to accomplish.  Surely the city is already isolated enough if its in the midst of an alien jungle.<br/><br/>P.S. Also, some parts of the city itself should be possessed by the alien forces.  Like, maybe some earth elementals have decided to possess certain buildings, which now move around sometimes or battle amongst themselves for the best spots on the streets.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189999/#Comment_189999" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-26T09:58:35+00:00" title="January 26, 2009  9:58AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I suppose I want the magical barrier to keep the game in the city or else this would be just another wilderness D&amp;D game.

Definitely. Yeah, it's heavy handed. I'll probably scrap it if the plot benefits don't outweigh the negative reaction that most everyone seems to have to it. I will make it clear that I want play to focus on the city, with occasional forays into the wilderness as they grow strong enough to face the challenges out there.<br/><br/>Partly, I was thinking that the heroic tier needs a clean separation from the paragon tier. I hadn't figured out how to have stuff be much more dangerous later. Going outside the city seemed like it should be what paragon characters do. However, I realize now that the monsters can grow in strength with the characters. Everything, for some reason, is gaining power. It's not like there are elder dragons sitting disinterestedly outside the city waiting for characters to reach 11th level.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190011/#Comment_190011" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-26T10:13:11+00:00" title="January 26, 2009 10:13AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>We've been found wanting - let us face our final test with zeal and righteousness.

Surely you can find one known to have vanished. Roanoke was my first thought, but it's way too modest for what you have in mind here. Sounds like you want something European.  Wikipedia mentions a number of real cities that have sunk into the sea or rivers, including Kitezh in Russia, Rungholt in Germany, and Saeftinghe in the Netherlands. The latter, also known as the "Drowned Land," was mostly lost in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Saints%27_Flood_(1570)" rel="nofollow">All Saints Flood of 1570</a>, which just screams "story hook."  Then again, while more gripping, that moves away from your intent of making a toolbox thing for other people to implement.<br/><br/>P.S. There's a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saeftinghe_legend" rel="nofollow">legend</a> that "attributes the All Saint's flood to capturing a mermaid and not setting her free.

I mean, maybe Old World denizens can still enter and (in most cases) leave the city, but they don't do it often, seeing as how the roads are terrible, the city is clearly in a state of ruination (and massive debt, largely written off), and its citizens don't even grasp that it is their own decadence which has ruined them.  Due to how bad things are, the Governor is seen as a despot, and is always at risk of losing his head whenever a Spanish general passes through.  The church receives many bad-apple novices and hardcore missionaries.  Sometimes the only way to deal with these meddlers is to kill them.  And maybe there are people from the city's immediate outlying areas with some idea of the city's real problem -- the buccaneers who sell them meat, a slave trader or two, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190071/#Comment_190071" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-26T13:17:25+00:00" title="January 26, 2009  1:17PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If there were a portal that led back home, why wouldn't everyone just leave?<br/><br/>You could say, "well, only certain people stayed behind," but then it doesn't have the apocalyptic feel I want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine" title="Daniel Levine"><img alt="Daniel Levine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine">Daniel Levine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190072/#Comment_190072" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-26T13:20:37+00:00" title="January 26, 2009  1:20PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a potential player in this game, you already know I think it's awesome.  Though it will mean revising my ideas, I kind of like the idea of rooting it in an actual city, especially one that something mysterious actually happened to.  Combining that with D&amp;D sort of puts me in mind of the re-tellings of folk tales in Hellboy (the comics, rather than the movie).  However, I'd say that I'd want it to be done in a way that didn't require me to read 700 pages of history - a one sheet with the "hollywood" version of the history would be ideal for me.  I'll read up on a lot of stuff that I'm interested in for its own sake, but I'd have trouble getting into doing a lot of research on say, some city-state of Italy that you were jazzed about.  It'd be cool, but only if you do most of the work. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>As a potential buyer... I think it'd be hard to sell me on a setting, or even setting elements.  I think of, e.g., OBE's Shroud stuff - a lot of it is cool, but I've pretty much totally ignored the Shroud concept.  There are *some* settings that have grabbed me enough to make me want to play them (for me, that would pretty much be Dark Sun and Eberron), but the sort of half-way "world seed" setting-bit idea seems harder to grab on to.<br/><br/>What I would be more jazzed about is something like *functional* bits of setting.  So, OBE's Unbroken is awesome in my mind, not b/c it has anything to do with the Shroud, but because it's a "Paladin who has lost his faith but does not seek redemption," which is a great character archetype.  I would be much more likely to buy a $2 product that was just billed as "100 awesome monsters from a savage jungle" or "14 bastions of civilization against an encroaching wilderness - with interesting interactive battle maps," without much in the way of explicit setting material (or whose setting material was brief and ignorable so I wasn't feeling like I was paying half of that $2 for stuff I was never going to use).<br/><br/>I could also get interested in a line of "a real city adapted to a fantasy world" products, especially ones from non-standard cultures (for fantasy RPGs), like Russia, or South Asia, or Africa (I will buy all your Africa world books, even the ones that suck).  Especially if they were written in such a way that they could be used either as, "here's a city for your Mythic Africa campaign, that was always fantasy-ish" *or* as, "here's an African city ripped through space-time to a fantasy world."  E.g., there could be lots of overlap - fantasy monsters, how PHB races might be interpreted in cultural terms ("Dragonborn will be revered, because the snake is a symbol of wisdom"), etc. - but also some points of difference having to do with the trauma of re-location vs. things always being that way.<br/><br/>Also, pogs.  I want sheets of pogs that represent stuff that's hard to find with Google Image Search, like African paladins.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Burr" title="Burr"><img alt="Burr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Burr">Burr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190073/#Comment_190073" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-26T13:22:12+00:00" title="January 26, 2009  1:22PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 26, 2009 1:27PM by Burr.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Uber-powered 16th century guns.

But I'd also love to see support for the kind of story that I would be more interested, about how you're here now, and there's no going back, and figuring out how you got there takes a back seat to adaptation and survival and building something new out of the wreckage of your culture.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190088/#Comment_190088" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-26T14:28:55+00:00" title="January 26, 2009  2:28PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Whole , turning into superpowered fantasy guys thing is growing on me, as i keep reading. <br/><br/>Would  I buy pdf's of tight material based on historical places and events designed for dnd 4th edition, if and only if the material is presented well and is of high original quality and competitvely priced. A couple bux a pdf sure, if I was the sort to do those kinds of things. Im not sure the freebie baseline is gonna help you much however. <br/><br/>A thought on the dome;<br/><br/>Have one of the humaans do it, no unexplained bits, the first martyr saint of lost velicca or whatever. <br/><br/>Old Farmer: Don't know how friar jon did it, but he damn well made a wall of pure glass and domed the entire city with it...<br/>Old Farmer 2: Ayup<br/>Old Farmer :Damn well Killed himself doing it too<br/>Old Farmer 2: Ayup, *Spit* Think he went to hell afterwards too. <br/><br/>I like the heroic teir being inside the city and the paragon outside, as for why stuff stays where it is, well, the walls worked well enough with bears, bandits, and other things in the real world. The last thing the guard would have done before retreating when they immediately showed up would have been drawing up bridges, and barring gates as best they could.  Among those later heroic things you could do would be locking an unlocked sally gate, etc. <br/><br/>Also like the whole, 2nd malign forces (Unground ocean full of starspawn and aboleth good idea, and good setting for the epic tier)<br/><br/>Also, I would take a strong look at the questing system in dnd 4th edition, I think it would lend itself to storygaming pretty well, as well as using more of the default rules.<br/><br/>This place is growing on me, Perhaps I will run the idea with a group sometime.

You need an Atlantean super-sorceror wandering around causing trouble, or being like Gandalf. Also, "Metrocalypse" is a better name than "Transit City," which means the apocalyptic elements need to played up: maybe Satan is an NPC. So look for millenarian weirdness to tie into the setting.  I'm down on the big force field, too: you don't need it, and it's so obviously what it is (DM fiat) that it breaks my suspension of disbelief and makes me mad at you when I'm your player. Of course, the things that I want are the things that move it away from being a backdrop for D&amp;D tactical crunchiness and more towards evocative creepy weirdness, playable with PTA or Mortal Coil.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190095/#Comment_190095" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-26T15:13:22+00:00" title="January 26, 2009  3:13PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daniel's got it right.  The cool thing about those old Malhavoc products like When A God Dies or When the Sky Falls is that they offer a variety of different options, which folks can incorporate into their game however they like.  I dig Atlantis or some other Ur-lost city being one explanation.  Like maybe Atlantis isn't really a place, right? Maybe it's the amalgamation of all cities that have ever been lost and so the new arrivals are just pieces of Atlantis that have only recently become lost.  Atlantis is like a virus that affects certain places and draws them here.  But I also totally dig having completely other explanations or just having it be the one city.  Maybe there are other cities out there in the jungle or maybe they're not.  I'd like the product to not give a clear answer but to throw out some cool possibilities.  Like, maybe the city was built on top of some creature/being that's originally from this jungle place, and so the city is really returning home.  Maybe the city wasn't pulled here; maybe it was banished from wherever it was before.  Maybe you're all dead and this is some kind of crazy purgatorium.

(The 'turn into dwarves' part is just beyond the pale for me, if I were to run the setting everyone who came with the city stays human, period.) I mean, really? Why can't they just, like, learn magic? Purposefully, with diligence, from some source that while mysterious at least is not totally arbitrary.<br/><br/>But then, as Stephen points out, why do I keep wanting to make the scenario more realistic/horrific when it's going to be played using D&amp;D combat? 'Oh no the vile deadly beast from beyond reality has attacked me with its horrible fangs! I will need to rest for at least two minutes to recover from that! Or maybe even sleep first!' I mean it's totally at cross-purposes to the kind of scenarios &amp; concerns I am imagining for this community.<br/><br/>So maybe a more pastiche-y, Atlantis+ approach will work better, given the project's final goals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190140/#Comment_190140" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-26T19:09:56+00:00" title="January 26, 2009  7:09PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure what you mean by "this community," Daniel. I'm not aiming this at story-gamers. It's aimed at D&amp;D players. I just know there are D&amp;D players and other creative people here who might dig this and might have good advice, so I'm sharing and learning.<br/><br/>D&amp;D 4E classes and stuff are already a lot like weird mystical powers, even among fighters and rogues. This just gives them a better explanation than the core rules do. It's also a grand excuse to drag D&amp;D stuff together with historical stuff and actually make it work in some weird way. It's really hard to make a true medieval setting work, or a real Byzantium setting work, when you have healing surges and fey pacts and all that stuff. But when a historical city gets grabbed and teleported into a fantasy world and invaded by monsters, it works. <br/><br/>I'm not trying to make Trail of Cthulhu here, either. It's gonna be D&amp;D 4E with a romping good monster-killing time as a core component of play. However, the flavor of such play will have a creepy, horror/apocalypse/survivalist vibe to it. If the 4E-ness prevails over those things a lot of the time, that's okay.
