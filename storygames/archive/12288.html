With bad practices however, it's a little more complicated. "Don'ts" are harder to phrase especially when they become a double negative. "Don't be a dick" is just too obvious anyway, while a lot of the other possibilities greatly depend on the game, as others have already pointed out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275501/#Comment_275501" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-11T07:11:03+00:00" title="June 11, 2010  7:11AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't seen anything that has persuaded me to reduce the list.

Likewise:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>- not having a story/plot/scenario that makes sense<br/>- not preserving the mystery of the story/plot/scenario</blockquote>Er... mysteries don't make sense until they are solved, usually. And Vincent Baker (playing DitV) would probably object strenuously to "preserving mystery" in a town, as investigation is not the Point of Play. Continuing:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>- going or allowing players to go gonzo</blockquote>This is way too black-and-white. Nothing is really black-and-white (except this statement).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>- not using the rules consistently<br/>- changing the rules too much<br/>- not discarded rules that don't work</blockquote>The first two strike me as redundant. Both are diametrically opposed to the third statement. And the third statement does not take into account that a GM might not understand the interplay of rule sub-systems and, as a result, might mistakenly remove a key rule, spoiling the whole game system. I'd subsume all this (and earlier rule-based statements) under "- doesn't understand the full rule system and how each component or sub-system contributes to the game's intended effect (agenda)."

But what you intend to do with it (email it to him? present it in a black envelope at the beginning of the next session? Nail it to his door?) strikes me as an odd sort of socializing. The implication is that you're current game has some issues that you feel come from bad GM'ing. Have you <i>talked</i> to them about it yet? Tried some gentle suggestions, see if the fellow is just inexperienced or over their head? Have you tried taking a break and letting someone else (with demonstratably better GM skills) run things for a while?

Which means that they put too much pressure on themselves, thinking that they and only they are the source of entertainment, performing on a lonely stage for a stone faced audience. <br/><br/>It is a far healthier thought to consider yourself a part of the team, in the vein of Mr. Corley's post.  If that mindset of everyone "trying hard to entertain themselves and each other" is present, then the GM knows he is responsible for just one aspect of the overall entertainment, but aware that the other people at the table need to do their part in making things fun for themselves and each other. That way the level of pressure is divvied up, and there is less anxiety associated with being a GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Anderson" title="John Anderson"><img alt="John Anderson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img2.imageshack.us/img2/7020/warningz.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Anderson">John Anderson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275670/#Comment_275670" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-11T22:17:57+00:00" title="June 11, 2010 10:17PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite><br/>...Not bringing pudding<br/>- Too little variation in puddings<br/>- Not bringing nice puddings<br/>- Not soliciting player ideas for pudding.<br/>- Not making my favourite pudding.<br/>- Not even knowing what my favourite pudding is.<br/><br/>Graham</blockquote>\nJeez.

A competent game designer is almost certainly going to have a much deeper understanding of the rules and how they are optimized to deliver the experience of the game than a random GM who happens to run he game sometimes. Sure, if you're playing a game like Shadowrun (where as written a subcompact going thirty miles an hour can kill a dragon, but heavy weaponry can't), then you have to house-rule the game to play. But if it's a well-written game, then you are probably making it worse by changing it, and more importantly you are delivering a different experience than the one I signed up for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275699/#Comment_275699" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-12T07:23:34+00:00" title="June 12, 2010  7:23AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The problem with "responsibility to perform" is when the *other* people consider it a responsibility.

I can recall a specific instance where I ran the game feeling as if the enjoyment of the players was a particular concern of mine, since it was being played as a sort of birthday present for one of the players. It was really terrible. Being worried about people having a good time meant that I wasn't focused on what my true responsibility was, which was to challenge their characters or, better, make the players <i>confront</i> their own characters.

Now what do you do?<br/><br/>So, as a Ganakagok GM, my major responsibility, aside from all of the rules-administering and stage-managing business, is taking the character-story you've created and throwing it back to you with some substance added, so that you can do something interesting with it. I think your enjoyment of the game will emerge as side effect of that.<br/><br/>Now, granted, I could be wrong about that; you may hate confronting what it means to have leadership responsibilities thrust upon your alter ego. But it's not my sole responsibility to remedy that; it's as much on you to throw a flag and tell me that I've given you something you regard as lame (although hopefully I will have asked for help long before that's necessary) so that we can fix it.<br/><br/>And also granted, I recognize that I'm the one who's probably most able to advise people playing the game about the sorts of play that will produce satisfying results versus those that will produce unsatisfying results, and so it's incumbent upon me to give a player a heads' up when he or she intends to do something in the latter category, but sometimes that advice is to protect the other players, and sometimes it's to protect my own sensibilities, so I'm not willing to concede that taking responsibility for other people's enjoyment is what that's about.<br/><br/>In other words, I'm unwilling to concede anything other than the fact that players and GMs do different things. At least, that's the position I'm taking for the sake of argument.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275865/#Comment_275865" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-13T21:50:42+00:00" title="June 13, 2010  9:50PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>Can you think of anything to add?<br/><br/>Typical GM failure points, in no particular order:</blockquote>\n- GMing a game when you don't really want to.<br/><br/>Lack of enthusiasm in a GM is <i>deadly</i>.

It's a semantic disagreement over what constitutes "being responsible for peoples' enjoyment". From your description, I would say it's certainly the GM's disproportionate responsibility to ensure that the game runs well and hence people have fun. Whatever you want to call that thing instead of "being responsible for fun," I'm happy to use as alternative terminology .\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>So, as a Ganakagok GM, my major responsibility, ...[description of system stuff and GM advice]. I think your enjoyment of the game will emerge as side effect of that.</blockquote>\nWell, I'd say it will emerge as a direct result of that, but let's concede for the sake of argument it's an emergent property. Of course the GM does not personally entertain the players like a dancing monkey - that's not what I'm saying. However, the game text in most games gives the GM certain roles and responsibilties which give that person a disproportionate influence on the fun of the game, even as an emergent property. Ganakogok can survive an unsuitable player, but if the GM role is not performed well- no fun at all. That's not a bad way of looking at it. If a game will be rubbish regardless of good players if the GM does not run the game well, then I'd say in that game, I want the GM coming to the table feeling responsible for players' enjoyment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275877/#Comment_275877" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-14T03:21:49+00:00" title="June 14, 2010  3:21AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2010 3:23AM by GB_Steve.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill's position, to me, sounds more like, everyone is responsible for the fun, not just the GM.

I once helped a professor of mine write an essay for a book called <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Relational-Responsibility-Sheila-McNamee/dp/0761910948" rel="nofollow">Relational Responsibility</a></i> to which he'd been invited to submit a chapter. The editors were interested in exploring a concept of responsibility that acknowledged the interdependence of individuals, their location in dyads and groups and social systems as well as within their own biographies; their goal, as I understand it, was therapeutic. My professor was skeptical in his essay, preferring his own conception of an ethical system grounded upon a vision of ideal communication practice (no manipulation, no deception, no closure), but I've often found it useful to invoke the idea of "relational responsibility" in my day-to-day life: yeah, this thing that made me mad at you? We did that together, and others helped us do it. Similarly, I've found it useful to think of an RPG session as a relational responsibility. -- Bill                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275997/#Comment_275997" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-14T15:08:19+00:00" title="June 14, 2010  3:08PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2010 3:08PM by Simon_Rogers.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Bill">@Bill</a> I think that's a healthy way to think of an RPG session.<br/><br/>However, you did GM for us at GenCon last year in return for cake, and were largely responsible for our enjoyment, which I think did make you our dancing monkey.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276008/#Comment_276008" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-14T15:49:54+00:00" title="June 14, 2010  3:49PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon Rogers</cite><a href="/forums/profile/Bill">@Bill</a> I think that's a healthy way to think of an RPG session.<br/><br/>However, you did GM for us at GenCon last year in return for cake, and were largely responsible for our enjoyment, which I think did make you our dancing monkey.</blockquote>\nShit.

But (1) I've played a LOT of Cthulhu and (2) I'm lazy and (3) I hate having to know the answer and (4) Cthulhu is not an onion, no matter how many editions of BRP CoC claim otherwise. Thus, I choose to run the game in a way unlikely to bore me, or require me to spend more time prepping alone than playing with my friends, just because that's how it's been done before. Players may be used to being entertained, but generally, they're at least as happy to entertain each other, as long as the entertainment happens somehow.<br/><br/>What matters for the purposes of this thread (I've made the case for democratization of play in CoC, and explained how I do it, in other threads) is seeing that there are choices to be made about how much of the fiction you gather into your bailiwick as GM. We can consciously, even ironically, adopt the "maximalist GM" historical contingencies as if they really were necessities, or we can move along the several continua of democratization of play according to how much we value things like strict player ownership of a given character, or at what level players contribute to the fiction (traditionally, players get to contribute to atmosphere and detail; I prefer to have them contribute to plot and even premise), or any of the other axes of control. And I think that we become better GMs in a wider range of play circumstances by acknowledging those choices and being ready to let go when it will improve the game, for us or for our fellow players. Na\xefve fallback to the old-school bundle of GM jobs works fine sometimes, but you will be awesome at more tables when you understand how arbitrary that was, and see how to play with each of the old expectations. One expectation to play with, and maybe decide to reject: "The GM is the entertainer."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276205/#Comment_276205" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-15T13:50:29+00:00" title="June 15, 2010  1:50PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2010 1:53PM by ccreitz.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>And there are expectations.

I have asked that exact question, probably in even fewer words, addressed to the whole table: "What <i>does</i> the book say?". If you're playing with people who know the genre conventions, that's a fun challenge to them. I wouldn't do that to a table of noobs, because it wouldn't be fun anymore. But I would do it to a table of tradition-bound BRPers in a heartbeat, because playing with their expectations can be rewarding for everyone. "This is <i>my</i> story too" is a rewarding realization, more rewarding than anything I have ever come up with, within the fiction, as a GM. Sometimes you can't pull it off, and that's OK too. You let Cthulhu be an onion for one Saturday afternoon, and it's fun because it isn't that way every time. I just wouldn't be able to drag myself to the table for fifty weeks in a row if it was just to find out that Cthulhu was an onion, again. I need to occasionally find out why it was that that book we found a few sessions back had <i>Dismiss Bugg-Shash*</i> in it, in a way where it's a surprise to me, too.<br/><br/>* "The Filler of Space." Yes, that's really Bugg-Shash's one-line description in the rulebook. The spell <i>Dismiss Bugg-Shash</i> was our group's running gag, because what else would you do to it?

And I don't think I did use pejorative language - I tried not to, at least.  "Na\xefve" was in the philosophy/lit-crit sense of "not subjected to the rigor of theory." Not considering the alternatives is na\xefve. Na\xefve is fine; no one needs theory. But is it wrong to point out that it's there and could be helpful in giving us consistent success?<br/><br/>And "arbitrary" - GMs aren't arbitrary, but the bundle of "traditional GM responsibilities" certainly is. I think that this has been demonstrated by the success of games in which those responsibilities are distributed differently. In any case, "arbitrary" isn't bad. Every distribution is equally arbitrary, old school or dirty hippie or anything else, but recognizing that fact, and then considering the broad range of strategies it opens to us, isn't easy.<br/><br/>The big one, though... insofar as role equalization is "democratic", then yes, traditional play <i>isn't</i>. Why is that bad? I specifically said I don't think it is. It's just one corner in the space of possible play styles, and the only thing "bad" about it is that we get attached to it and miss out on opportunities to offer rewards to players (and ourselves) that don't normally fall out of old-school play. Avoiding that corner would just as blind - it has rewards of its own, obviously. But I don't think, due to the history of the hobby, that it's even possible not to acknowledge, and make use of, that style of play. It doesn't need advertising.<br/><br/>I'm happy to substitute a value-neutral term for "democratization of play" if you can think of one that's clear, and you don't think that it is one itself. I'd be willing to call it "lazy GMing" if everyone knew what I meant - I'm trying to get that one to take root, in fact. If I use a term with negative connotations instead, will everyone believe me that I really want to emphasize potential, rather than valorize some aspect of dirty hippie play? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276410/#Comment_276410" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-16T13:25:34+00:00" title="June 16, 2010  1:25PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon Rogers</cite>If you are a goalkeeper, and you have the attitude "it's the team's responsibilty to stop goals getting in, not mine", I don't want you on my team.</blockquote>\nWell said!<br/><br/>I suspect most people actually agree with this perspective.

I accept the responsibility to do what I can to help the others participate and have meaningful input to play." <br/><br/>Bad version: "The game's not fun! I'm going to cross my arms and complain, because that means this GM sucks." In other words, that personal responsibility is good; but the expectation to invest someone else with responsibility, the expectation among the group that fun is Bob's responsibility, is bad. <br/><br/>I think where wires get crossed, though, is the traditional alignment of the GM role with the social organizer role and the rules teacher/facilitator role. While that's often the case in gaming circles, it needn't be.<br/><br/>For example, if I'm running a one-shot for a bunch of strangers, and we're playing a game they're not familiar with, I know that I, as GM, should expect to be helping people learn the rules, making sure everyone gets a turn to speak, and trying to make the game experience as much fun as possible for them.<br/><br/>But I've also seen situations where those roles are mixed up. Say Julie joins an existing roleplaying group. They like to play D&amp;D at Bob's house. Bob invites everyone over for supper, including Terry, who is the resident rules expert, and who used to GM most games for the group. Julie is not very familiar with D&amp;D, and it's her first time at Bob's house, but she has an idea for an adventure (or whatever) and would like to try her hand at GMing D&amp;D.<br/><br/>They get together and they play! I wouldn't be surprised if Bob was the one people look to in order to check on things like: "When should we get started? How long do we expect the game to run?" "How late is too late? Should we pick up the pace and try to wrap up once we hit 10:00, or 11:00, or what?" "When is a good time for a break?" I would NOT expect Julie to be responsible for handling those things--after all, she doesn't know how things are run in Bob's household, when people need to go to bed, etc.<br/><br/>At the same time, Terry might be the one fielding the rules questions, and pointing out to Julie (or anyone else) where a certain rule might need to be applied or corrected in order for the game to run smoothly. Maybe the new GM isn't familiar with all the rules, and it's easier to let them handle the fiction and have Terry handle some of the mechanical issues that come up.<br/><br/>Likewise, if Terry was used to GMing for the group, he might be looked to by the group in order to speak up when Kate, the quiet one of the group, hasn't had a chance to say/do anything. After all, Julie doesn't have the experience to know that Kate is shy about take her turn, or whatever. I wouldn't expect Julie to be responsible for that--she doesn't know Kate and doesn't know this group's dynamics, after all. (And I've seen this one happen a fair bit, when guest GMing for existing groups--a player might say, "Hang on, we haven't heard from Phil for a while. What's your character doing in the meantime, Phil?"<br/><br/>But maybe the whole group knows that Kate, while quiet, tends to be the genius who pulls unrelated plotlines together or delivers great one-liners, or comes up with the best character concepts. That group wouldn't be expecting Julie to do that, if they know they can do it on their own--the GM giving them enough material to work with and then backing off might work. Whereas Julie trying to "create the fun" for the group, unaware of how Phil and Kate and Terry work together, might be less fun for the group than allowing a quiet moment for Kate to jump in with a funny in-character voice or whatever.<br/><br/>My point is that thinking of "the fun" as the GM's responsibility, as well as many of these other roles, isn't necessarily wrong, but can be a slippery slope. I find it much more helpful to think of the <i>group</i>'s fun: a team working to fulfill a shifting set of duties. And responsibilities are often spread out based on skills, experience, and social circumstances (maybe Jim's wife is the only one who knows how not to set off his painful childhood memories in a Dogs in the Vineyard game; it's then her responsibility to speak up if she needs to).<br/><br/>A group like the semi-hypothetical one I've described can have a great time without expecting Julie to "give them one". It's kind of like orgasms. Yeah, there's another person involved, but really, you know what you need to do for yourself--they can't generally do it <i>for you</i>. <br/><br/>My worry would be that Julie, expecting the "responsibility" of making the fun for the group (and all the long list up above) might actually squash some of those useful group dynamics, working against herself and against the group. Just like chasing after giving someone an orgasm in bed might totally ruin the experience if that's not what they're after at the moment.<br/><br/>(Excuse the crude analogy.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276429/#Comment_276429" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-16T14:15:57+00:00" title="June 16, 2010  2:15PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 16, 2010 2:16PM by JDCorley.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's really less of an analogy and more of another example.

How can I tell? As always, by looking at their typical antonyms - logical, sophisticated and dictatorial. Which set of words would you rather have applying to the game you enjoy? Please use other non-value laden words, as you suggest for "democratic". The distribution of responsibilty in RPGs is not a moral issue. It's a matter of choice. All of us here are "sophisticated" enough to know that different games have different distributions of responsibilities. This "corner" you speak of is almost every roleplaying game ever written.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul">@Paul</a> T <a href="/forums/profile/Jenksot">@Jenksot</a><br/>I agree. Just because the goalkeeper takes primary responsibility for not letting goals in, doesn't mean the rest of the team shouldn't do their bit. Again, it's attitude. And yes, it's possible to conflate GMing duties with social duties, hence the corallary of "not accepting the social and system reponsibilties your chosen game system recquires" is "not knowing the limits of your social and system responsbilty arising from your chosen game system" or "assuming the GM role doesn't make you the boss of me." Both these rules can be summarised as "don't be an arse." I suppose because these social isses have simply never been a problem for me, I could be underestimating them. We are a group of GMs though. I do like it when GMing if other players know specifc setting details, are familiar with rules subsets, or keep careful notes of clues and NPCs.<br/><br/>This allows me to get on with the primary GMing role of MAKING EVERYONE HAVE FUN! <br/><br/>(I kid because I love)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276475/#Comment_276475" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-16T16:28:19+00:00" title="June 16, 2010  4:28PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 17, 2010 12:23AM by Per_Fischer.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this is a good discussion despite the occasional "Whoa, crazy anti-GM delusionist hippie, kill!" themed posts - it's OK, I did the "crazy GM-is-in-charge delusionist redneck" myself, so I'm cool with that <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>In 1986, when I started GM-ing with the red box in hand, and at least the next 15 years for whatever system, you bought the book (box), read it, prepared a game for days on end, invited people to your place, was the host, storyteller, rules arbitrator, entertainer, mediator etc etc, Steve's list and more, basically. In many cases you even had to keep hold of character sheets for the players, otherwise they would magically disappear.<br/><br/>In many ways, that was the price you had to pay to play roleplaying games in my local community (unless, of course, there was another "GM" in the village ready to do it for you). I don't regret doing it, but I got tired of it and wanted more. Around 1999 I got together with a couple of other GM types like myself that shared some of the same interests in games as me to start a new "campaign" - my demand was that I, or indeed no one else, should be "The GM", on principle. We decided to rotate as GM for each session, not a huge leap in imagination I admit, but for me it set an important precendent: no one person is in charge for everybody else's fun. And every participant had to do it, had to take his/her share in writing/preparing and running a session. It was the best gaming experience ever, and still to this day, post indie-forge-hippie games, still ranks in my top 5.<br/><br/>Those were my reasons for feeling that Steve's original list, and some of the follow-up posts even more so, was a huge step backwards, but perhaps only for me personally. If people prefer this kind of authority, I don't really mind, as long as I don;t have to be involved as GM or as player.<br/><br/>Peace and orgasms to you all <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276483/#Comment_276483" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-16T16:55:01+00:00" title="June 16, 2010  4:55PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 16, 2010 4:55PM by ccreitz.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Simon">@Simon</a>: OK, I accept (with regret) that no non-philosopher will buy my value neutrality claim on "nai\xa8ve", and that no one cares what the referent of "arbitrary" is. I retract everything I said about the former, since it's not really important to my larger message, and will say instead that the bundle of GM responsibilities associated with the old school is instead "the best-attested approach in the first generation of games, and widely understood to be the standard against which games which choose other distributions are compared."  Please read my earlier posts with that wording in mind.<br/><br/>The problem word is definitely "democratic". What I want to say is "distributing authority more or less evenly among all players." All the words I can use have picked up good connotations: democratic, egalitarian, decentralized authority. Faced with no really good option, I've decided on absurdity. Henceforth, I shall use the word "jeeble" (a mass noun) to mean, but have none of the connotations (good or bad) of, "democracy", and then I can say "You should be alert for the chance to use jeeblization-of-play techniques when you have an audience that might enjoy it, even if you're playing a usually old-school game like BRP Call of Cthulhu" and everyone will understand that I'm being my usual positive and enthusiastic self (seriously! ask the people who play with me!), trying to increase the fun, for a wide range of tables and styles, of a game that has given me 15 years of enjoyment. Our relationship is complicated, of course, but isn't that how it always is with the ones you really value (and jeeblize)?<br/><br/>JEEBLE. It's actually a really fun word. Too fun? It is easier to type than "democratization", too, and perversely clearer than "lazy GMing", since it doesn't collide with other meanings. "If you don't enjoy high-jeeble games, I'd steer clear of 'Nasocorn'." That is a lot less confrontational than the alternative, and you can use your tone to make it sound bad when it really is a barrier to fun play. "Yeah, the second play mode of $game kind of leads to exquisite corpse fiction. Too much jeeble, not enough structure to compensate." You get a little of the halo of "heebie jeebies" that way. I think, quite seriously, that I'm going to try this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276485/#Comment_276485" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-16T16:58:58+00:00" title="June 16, 2010  4:58PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems like some people have been very affected by some encounters with poor GMs in the past, quite probably for some of the reasons already listed. Of course the list does pre-suppose that there is a GM in the game, so complaining about the existence of a GM is really out of court. <br/><br/>You can make another list for how GM less games might fail due to problems with distributed authority. It's probably the same list with GM crossed out and Distributed Authority written in instead. I know, we'll call it Game Management instead. If you read Game Management each time you come across the term GM, then perhaps you can get through this thread without conniptions, schadenfreude or sadness.<br/><br/>If you want to know how awesome a game with GM can be, look around for Flaming Taft.

Let's not undersell the painful differences!<br/><br/>I think it's important to say that no part of my agenda is a hidden desire for revenge against the (notional) GM who dirtied and hippified me. It really is an endogenous desire to play with the roles at the table - a case of spreading meta - that led me to my current play aesthetic. I caught the jeeble from a GM I admire, one who happened to use fishing (the Mountain Witch trick, but before that) in a D&amp;D game one day, rather than being driven to escape or show up a GM of whom I thought poorly. On account of almost always playing with my friends, and getting lucky at the few cons I've gone to, I haven't had any poor GMs. Once, during my Cthulhu-centric period, I stopped being the Keeper for a week, and it was OK fun but everyone agreed that it didn't work out as well as our usual arrangement, so I started again the next week, and that's as bad as I've got! I've got nothing to complain about on that front whatsoever.<br/><br/>When I started watching <i>Yo Gabba Gabba</i> with my very small children, I determined that I would take DJ Lance Rock's hyper-enthusiastic onscreen persona as my role model for gaming, especially GMing, and it's been working great! I just can't shut up about the fun I've had doing things this way, for better or for worse. And I guess I was the wrong person to post in this thread because I don't know jack about non-awesome GMs. I'm an awesome GM, my friends are awesome GMs, and the GMs I've drawn at cons have all been awesome. If I walked up to some random dude on the street, handed him my battered AD&amp;D DMG, and stood there looking expectant, he'd be an awesome GM too, given my streak.
