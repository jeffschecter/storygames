After all, it's really about a solo protagonist, at times a group of two.  The accepted format typically is 'party play.'<br/><br/>"If only," I said, "there was a game that has a group of people working together for a common goal but they know they might have to turn on each other at the end.  Oh, and some kind of Trust mechanic."<br/><br/>Mountain Witch: Hunger Games.<br/><br/>Instead of zodiacs, you have Districts, some of which traditionally get along, and others which traditionally don't (probably triplets for Allied signs, so 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, 10-12).<br/>Some of the Dark Fates completely work: Revenge, Desperately in Love, for example.  Pact with the Witch might be Pact with the Gamemakers.  True Motives is a little weird, but I bet someone would come up with something cool for it.<br/><br/>I'd also tweak the Games themselves, making them bigger- you might have an alliance of 6 people, but you pretty much half to, because there's another 42 people out there.  Also set up a mixture of immediate and long term goals- maybe the different people start in clusters and there's a central location, a mountain, if you will, with extra supplies that's in a perilous location.  And when you get there, it's not the Witch who faces you, its a hologram of the Gamemaker, who speaks the bitter truths that will turn the participants against each other.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371132/#Comment_371132" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-04T07:04:28+00:00" title="April  4, 2012  7:04AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds really cool.

And then there's a big fight and victory.<br/><br/>After that, this much more world-aware protagonist starts on a much larger story arc that involves eventually gathering a key group of allies that will work together to change the whole city/country/continent/world/galaxy/whatever. That second story arc is much larger, so it's split into 2 parts.<br/><br/>The first story is challenging to do with a typical multiplayer rpg game, because it tends to be extremely focused on the protagonist. Some times there are solidly significant other characters, but usually the bonds between them haven't solidified enough to make troupe play work well. The second story tends to be more troupe friendly with more room for significant contributions from outside the group.<br/><br/>That being said, I don't see why a game about the Hunger Games couldn't include significant contributions from characters other than Tributes. When the story is presented from a single character perspective, Hamish's contributions during the Games seem remote and cryptic, which creates ironic tension (cause the audience is given clues to understand his messages better than Katniss does). But in a tabletop session, you could change that up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371474/#Comment_371474" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-05T14:36:40+00:00" title="April  5, 2012  2:36PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, if I were to try and replicate the Arena phases, I would use a combat-heavy rules like D&amp;D 4e.<br/>\nBut if I wanted to capture the relationship aspects, I might want to try Bliss Stage.

My guess is the movie did a relatively poor job of capturing the heart of the first book, but even in the movie the heart clearly was not about who wins the games or which kid kills which kid. It's a futurist dystopian exploration.<br/><br/>I don't know where the books go, so any spoilers are accidental and conjecture. But I could see a game about awfulness and division still being appropriate (though maybe not TMW specifically - because the Witch of the Games doesn't live in a castle. She lives in our hearts). When you want the theme to be about (a) society learning how to come together, the game can still focus on driving it apart because that sort of theme is better as a difficult one. Make it too obvious or direct and it tends to come across as preachy or shallow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371541/#Comment_371541" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-06T07:49:14+00:00" title="April  6, 2012  7:49AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Notably, killing the witch doesn't mean you've won TMW either. Killing the witch is typically not especially important by the time you get around to actually doing it. That's part of why I think it's so appropriate.
