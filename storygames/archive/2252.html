                    Hey all: So, after digging through Spirit Of The Century I've decided to set up some "pick up game packs" to be used when the normal game session falls through. I'm also thinking of it as a good way to eat through some of my unplayed games.  Whispering Vault, or as I like to call it "<b>Clive Barker's Superfriends</b>", is next on the list.<br/><br/>So when I was digging through its relatively uncomplex system, I couldn't get past the fact that it seems to me that unless you set all difficulties for tasks at "Easy", the PCs are going to fail A Lot.  Is this just me, or do people who have experience with the game see otherwise.  To get an Easy task done, you pretty much have to have high doubles (at least) on a series of d6es. Once you get to the "Hards", your immortal half-demon time traveler would lose even on triples unless they had stacked all of their skill points into that one particular skill.<br/><br/>I'm wondering if there's an alternative.  Lowering difficulty? Alternate resolution rules?  <br/><br/>-Andy                </div>

                            The quantitative aspect of WV's system resolution mechanic totally bit nards. I'd have to pull out the book again to see exactly how terrible it was, but I posed this same question on RPG.net quite a while ago. I'm not sure I got any satisfactory answers. <br/>
<br/>
I think what I ultimately did was rework the entire difficulty scale. I did a little basic math (don't recall any of the numbers any more) to come up with new difficulty numbers that were actually reasonable. <br/>
<br/>
IIRC, the currently difficulties don't match exactly to multiples. I.e., it's not like you're going for 3-6-9 for easy-difficult-hard. I think I converted it to straight multiples of some kind or maybe vice-versa. It made overall difficulties a lot easier, but then I went through and looked at the horrendous monsters and decided that I did okay after all. <br/>
<br/>
In the default system, PC can barely stomp out the norms, and they get utterly crushed by the monsters. Ultimately, there's two ways to approach it: fix the monsters so they're not so difficult, or adjust the overall system to manage the inflated monster stats.                        </div>

Don't get me wrong, normally I love large dice pools. I'm thinking, of maybe making a few tweaks to reduce the pool to around 4-6 dice max and still have some good chance of slamming demon skull.  Will have to think about it.                        </div>

                            Hi guys,<br/>
<br/>
My experience with The Whispering Vault leads me to think that the game plays best when Karma awards are generous. The players can then really think about when they want to spend them for (much-needed) dice benefits. If I were to play again, I'd steal a bit from HeroQuest and give out Karma at the beginning as well as the end of every session, so that both in-game bonus spending and between session improvement-spending were both on the map.<br/>
<br/>
In my view, as well, the game suffers from a lot of aversive reactions that are quite unjust. "It blows," "the system sucks," and so on, none of which I've observed to be true in practice.<br/>
<br/>
Best, Ron                        </div>

                            During a brief period of play, we found some problems with the game, the primary one being the difficulty rating. It is way too high for normal player success.<br><br>Second, there are two or three skills that are essential for the players to have. I kind of felt that the players should automatically have those skills by default. In fact, we found the endgame to be very tedious and formulaic, with the characters rolling and failing and rolling again to bind and banish the beasties or whatever they are called.<br><br>Third, and this could have been solved by long term play, but the players felt a little bummed, they spent a bunch of time talking about and describing their own little humble abodes and their great appearance and building up a theme for their character and they'd end up getting dumped in the French Revolution and all of that meant very little.<br><br>To be honest, having read Nobilis (but never getting around to playing it), I considered it Whispering Vault done right. We all really wanted to like Whispering Vault but put it away after two sessions, it simply didn't deliver...                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Andy, when I talked to you about it last year I didn't think you were very interested and I thought it would be an uphill battle to sell anyone on trying the game.  I was going to appeal to the unusual fact that all of us still at the table--you, Travis, Mark and I--all had the game and had never played.  Even I can recognize a sign from God--and I'm an atheist.  <br/><br/>I had gone so far as to start reading through the book again, but I got sidetracked.  If there's anything I can do to help you make it work, even to go so far as to run it for you, let me know.  It's certainly worth talking about at some point.  I'll be thinking about possible solutions as well.                        </div>
