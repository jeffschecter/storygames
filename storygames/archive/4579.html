But, there are two small problems with that:<br/><br/>1) I haven't played or run the game before.<br/>2) Neither have my players (or most of them, at least).<br/><br/>I've become reasonably familiar with the rules, though many of the particulars are still a little vague.<br/><br/>I plan mainly to concentrate on the character creation bit, and try the scenario included in the game.  Hopefully years of GMing experience will help me through the rest of it. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>So, I'm mainly looking for advice for a first time SotC GM that I can use to help me make this more fun for me and my players.

And I have run the "engine" for a Spirit of Eberron game.  <br/><br/>So.  Here is my advice:<br/><br/>Character Generation is pretty easy and structured, it will take care of itself, especially with a few players at the table.  You might have suggest an Aspect or two to those who might be stuck.  Make sure that the players know that "negative" Aspects are awesome... Greedy and playing to the Greedy Aspect is going to generate Fate Chips for the player.<br/><br/>The way the stages are set up and weave the PCs into each other's stories is brilliant and a lot of adventure hooks can come up from that.  If you find better ideas in their character generation, go with that adventure, not the canned one.  Those Aspects and charcter generation are big, huge flags waving showing you what the players are interested.<br/><br/>Let everyone know that they can switch up skills and stunts and aspects in play for a few sessions as the PCs unfold in play.  LIke I took Empathy and not Rapport (they are pretty damn similar in some respects)... and wanted both for a recent PC.  Judd let me erase one skill and add in Rapport.  Right during play.  It some times takes a bit of shaking out to happen to capture the tone of a said PC.<br/><br/>Read and re-read how Consequences work.  We just had a fight where Fu Manchu used nothing but Social Consequences on my Assassin-turned-good Crimson, and I used nothing but knives against him.  We both were cut to ribbons and out of Fate and both having Minor, Major Consequences... although my PC, although wounds were psychic, word play, "come back to us" kinda-thing.  It was awesome.  Fu Manchu conceded the fight by jumping off the building... no man could survive that fall... yeah... right.  He'll be back....<br/><br/>In Play:<br/>Give out Fate as fast as possible.  Encourage them to spend as much as possible.  Nothing wrong with blowing 3 FATE pts on a single roll when it means a lot to the PCs.  Try to compel (ie, bribe) their Aspects.<br/><br/>Planning:<br/>Award the players for not overthinking too much.  This is Pulp.  Getting captured by the enemy in order to find their secret lair is a perfectly acceptable plan.  Let a single Investigation roll glean add'l cool info...but a failed roll doesn't stop the info flow either.  Sherlock Holmes might botch a roll, but he will still glean something from the scene.  Let the bad guys make mistakes and clue the good guys quickly into what is going on.  <br/><br/>First Combat:<br/>Put them up against some mooks (read up on mook rules).  This will give them the sense of Pulpy two fisted heroes who can mow down lesser opponents.  I think this is important for the tone of the Pulp experience along the lines of the Shadow, the Spider, Doc Savage, Tarzan etc.  Don't put them up against an opposite team of folks at their level... the combat will drag on for quite some time.<br/><br/>When it doubt, slow down, take a look at the book... better yet, hand it off to a player... have them use the excellent index, while play continues... pause when he finds the rule in question and simply let the table learn it.  This advice is really hard for me to follow sometimes.  But it works.  I hate slowing down the game.  But if everyone at the table learns the system, then their actions and choices are empowered.  Judd has taught me that. <br/><br/>I recommend "Pulp Culture" (Robinson and Davidson), a decent book on the Art of Fiction Magazines.  Maybe it is at your library.  Bring a book like it to the gaming table.  Judd's girlfriend didn't know what Pulp was and we had been talking about it.  I showed her Pulp Culture and she spent 5 minutes flipping and went "oh, I got it!".  The Pulps were sold by their lurid and exciting covers... often the covers were better than the stories they accompanied.  In an odd way, Pulp adventure is a very visual medium.  I dare anyone who is running SOTC to flip through Pulp Culture (or another book like it) and NOT come up with at least 5 different characters and adventure hooks.<br/><br/>Have fun!!!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103645/#Comment_103645" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T08:50:02+00:00" title="October 18, 2007  8:50AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everything Storn said is gold.

I'm perfectly pleased with the core idea, but we failed to bring it up to speed.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhosmer1" title="jhosmer1"><img alt="jhosmer1" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4010/4446384493_29cc47b601_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhosmer1">jhosmer1</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104209/#Comment_104209" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-22T17:01:03+00:00" title="October 22, 2007  5:01PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I posted this on my Washington, DC, Meetup thread, but thought I would repost the relevant stuff here.  Look over on that thread for pictures of our group.<br/><br/>Finally, tho, it was time for Spirit of the Century! We were joined by TonyLB from here, and made up characters. We ended up with:<br/><br/>Ken Habib, a Man of Two Worlds (Asia and Africa) -- John<br/>Rosa Giavonelli, Mafia Daughter Tomboy -- Patty<br/>Randall, Lord Swagger, and his Turbine-Powered Jetpack -- Tony<br/>Fred Fortune, Playboy Inventor -- Sean<br/>Lilly Bloom, Plucky Detective (and Knitter!) -- Mona<br/><br/>After finishing our characters, where we learned interesting things about ourselves ("Wait, what does _IN_flammable mean?" "Your Father is WHO?", "Yes, yes, I'd never act this way if my mother was alive."), the characters found themselves in a zeppelin floating gently over Washington, DC, at a swanky party hosted by Fred Fortune's parents ("My Parents Paid for That." -- Sean) to look into the possibility of knitting zeppelin bags ("Don't anger the woman with the pointy sticks!" -- Mona). The guests also included a delegation from the newly established African country of Freedonia (something that happened in one of the novels the characters shared.)<br/><br/>While Fred was talking with a senator about the knitting project, the zeppelin was suddenly attacked by Abdul, the Arab of the Air, and his bedouin warriors! The centurions quickly squared off against Abdul and his nomads, with Fred pulling a hand-gatling gun out of his pocket (universal gadget) and Lilly and Ken attacking their foes with knitting needles and fountain pens (Anything Goes). At one point, Randall actually threw a bedouin into a chandelier, causing it to crash to the ground and spray broken glass over the scene.<br/><br/>The bedouin fell, but Abdul managed to make it back to his airship with a Freedonian Princess. The party quickly followed after him, either using the grappling lines the bedouin originally used, or Randall's turbine-powered jetpack. The fight continued in Abdul's opulent, silk-covered chambers. Fred ran down into the engine spaces while the rest of the party fought together, pulling the rug out from under Abdul's feet (literally), blinding him with another rug, and disarming him before Randall smashed into him with his jetpack, carrying Abdul out into the night sky where he fell down into the Potomac River below.<br/><br/>All seemed fine, except that Fred crossed some wires on his attempt to sabotage the zeppelin ("If it moves, it must explode" aspect compel) and Abdul's zeppelin began to explode. The party (except for Randall, who is flying outside) managed to get to emergency biplane, only to find that there are too many of them. So Lily calls out to Randall, who swoops in and carries her off (after a death-defying run through the corridors of Abdul's airship) only to find that she weighs too much for the jetpack to support....<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the others try to escape in the biplane, only for the release latch to jam. Ken unties himself from the wing and forces the latch open, sending both him and the biplane into freefall! Fred just manages to start the engine as Ken grabs onto the wing of the biplane by his fingertips!<br/><br/>Randall, meanwhile, unhooks the belt of this jet pack and ties it on to Lilly, points her in the direction of their original zeppelin, and lets go, falling into the Potomac below, while Lily flies to safety. (Randall has a death defiance stunt, so he shall return).<br/><br/>We had a lot of fun, and would have loved to play more, but it was getting late, so we stopped there. Why Abdul was after a Freedonian princess, we just don't know, but at least his plan was thwarted... this time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104228/#Comment_104228" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-22T19:53:11+00:00" title="October 22, 2007  7:53PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Smells like a WINNER!!!<br/><br/>cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104261/#Comment_104261" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-23T03:29:52+00:00" title="October 23, 2007  3:29AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 23, 2007 3:32AM by renatoram.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very, very nice action scene Jeffrey! <br/><br/>Were the heroes rightly compelled in the process?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhosmer1" title="jhosmer1"><img alt="jhosmer1" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4010/4446384493_29cc47b601_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhosmer1">jhosmer1</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104307/#Comment_104307" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-23T08:06:14+00:00" title="October 23, 2007  8:06AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know about the heroes being "rightly" compelled.

That's how I did it too.  First it was all bonuses and fate spending and compels.  Then I did a chase, and (purposely) focused on chase rules.  And then a fight where I introduced (by accident but the time was right) tagging and scene aspects.  Then social conflict.  Sort of building like a tutorial.  Now, it's my first time running too, so the slow build up is as much for me as them.  As we get used to some element, I add to it.
