Each contestant fights to the death, but may gain favor and gifts from the audience by being more interesting. For example, you could claim to be in love with another contestant and, if you're convincing enough to the audience, they'd send you gifts that could help you survive the games.<br/><br/>As an RPG, this would interesting because you're playing characters that are consciously trying to be more interesting characters. Their survival depends on it, actually. So very meta.<br/><br/>Anyhoo, how would you play it? My first vote goes to InSpectres, because the reality TV structure is already baked in.

The dramatic build of the Reaping to all the pre-game pageantry (including the importance of costume and presentation) are what make the interactions in the Arena work. <br/><br/>How do you play that out without boring everyone to tears, though? It seems like you'd almost want to try to leave the Pre-Games a little free-form, giving players material, like interview questions, moments alone and with others, and descriptions of the costumes their prep-team puts them in to set up the tensions that will be exploited in the arena. Maybe this could be table driven? [Edit: I mean tables as lists, not simply what happens at the table]<br/><br/>Rob, I'm curious about the set-up of your game.

There was a great deal of setup, though, where we talked about why these kids were working together and some of what came before. But maybe starting with some of that stuff would've been interesting.<br/><br/>Bret, why do you hate to be the guy to talk about your game? I think your game would be extraordinarily good for Hunger Games.
