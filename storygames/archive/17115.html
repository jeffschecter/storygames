I just posted this on my blog, but I know quite a few of you don't follow that but are relevant to this idea.<br/><br/><b>If you've playtested Mythender, please visit this page to make sure your name is on the playtest credits and is spelled as you'd like it:</b> <a href="http://ryanmacklin.com/2012/08/mythender-playtest-credits/" rel="nofollow">ryanmacklin.com/2012/08/mythender-playtest-credits/</a><br/><br/>Please don't reply here to inform me; my blog post will serve as the archive. (Of course, if you also want to reply here to bump the thread, also cool).<br/><br/>Thanks, all of you! You guys have my Mythic Heart.<br/><br/>- Ryan                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
