You can use infographics to explain most of the processes, show all sort of concept art to define the setting, make silent comics to explain the characters and how everything works in the fiction, show how an AP looks like... but then, how to you explain how players verbally negotiate the fiction? what about the techniques, how do you teach them when to use each? You could make a paralel of the comic that describes the fiction with the one that describes how the players are negotiating it, so you could learn when you need to roll the dice... but most of it would be so troublesome you will be a lot better using words enough to describe how to do some of these things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420267/#Comment_420267" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-17T15:02:18+00:00" title="August 17, 2013  3:02PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2013 3:03PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>However there's no way you could explain a verbal game without using a single word, It'd look as hieroglyphs.</blockquote>\nI'm imagining some kind of IKEA-esque game now. At least a third of the game is trying to figure out what that infographic means, and half is trying to decide if the part in your hand is the one you're supposed to be using, or if it's maybe the one over there instead.

We see a meteor fall from the sky. A diverse set of people see it fall: an insectoid alien, a neanderthal, a pair of post apoc mutants and a first person view of us, the reader (represented by our hands being visible). They all travel to find the crash sight and encounter different things on the way. They find an alien artifact displaying icons holographically displayed above it. Five glowing empty rectangles move towards the pair of mutants.  Then the Icons flash. The pair conjecture (this is where the text comes in) that they should use the symbols to tell the story of their journey (flashbacks matched with the symbol they choose could also accomplish this) using five Icons. Then the insectoid gets the glowing empty rectangles. Choosing Icons and using gestures, body language and inflection of speech, each traveller tells his/her story. Because we don't know what "we", the reader, look like or what we did on the way, we must invent our story. Assuming each player basically understands one another's story, we will have created a basic "language" from the icons.<br/><br/>Theoretically, the game would be language independent; four people who understand the concept but share no language could play together. It would be interesting to compare notes between what was actually told and what was inferred by the Icons.<br/><br/>Mutant #1: "What's the point?"<br/>Mutant #2: "To tell our story, I think."<br/>Mutant #1: "Yes, but why?"<br/>Mutant#2: "To communicate. To understand."<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420271/#Comment_420271" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-17T16:10:05+00:00" title="August 17, 2013  4:10PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm currently 6 pages into my project for redefining the game "Walkabout" purely in the form of a comic book.<br/><br/>Tentatively we'll have...<br/><br/>Prologue: Finding the Right Players and Establishing Mood (by watching relevant movies and reading relevant books)<br/>Introduction: Character Generation<br/>Act 1: Setting the scene and understanding basic game mechanisms<br/>Act 2: Adding complications to the story, teamwork tasks and minor conflicts<br/>Act 3: Ramping up the action, raising the stakes on conflict mechanisms<br/>Act 4: Making a climax suitably dramatic, character death<br/>Epilogue: Character development, moving on to new stories<br/><br/>The concept is very art heavy, with a minimum of text to help explain what's going on.

Maybe it's an iconographic picture-speech, or maybe it was just a common set of visual conventions that end up acting as a repeatedly used shorthand, but in the end, it's hard not to conclude that we developed written language because it's just better at doing certain things than grunts, gestures, and cave paintings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AllanDotson" title="AllanDotson"><img alt="AllanDotson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/587/nCEFJQOAECTHQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AllanDotson">AllanDotson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420323/#Comment_420323" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-18T21:07:50+00:00" title="August 18, 2013  9:07PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I took the challenge and started working on a pretty basic art-only rpg (It is comic form, and makes heavy use of symbols).

You did a good job here: Montages of pictures can suggest level of specificity depending on how similar or different the components are. Showing generic images from just any city might just mean "a city"; showing recognizable images from multiple different cities (Paris skyline, New York Skyline, Hong Kong skyline) means "cities"; showing multiple, recognizable images from a single, specific city, like New York (Statue of Liberty, Times Square, Empire State Building) specifically means "New York City." The target numbers page approaches this pretty well by showing three very different kinds of challenges all occupying the same space, and takes it a step further by showing different stages of those challenges.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AllanDotson" title="AllanDotson"><img alt="AllanDotson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/587/nCEFJQOAECTHQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AllanDotson">AllanDotson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420631/#Comment_420631" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-23T16:09:43+00:00" title="August 23, 2013  4:09PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for your comments!

It's still not quite finished, but I'm going to need to step back from it for a while to work on other things, and I'd appreciate any feedback on what I've got so far.  <br/><br/>I am definitely taking advantage of readers' existing gaming knowledge.  This would be much harder to do as a first-time, introductory rpg.<br/><br/>JasonT, your city montage example is a great one.  All those city images would sure be more work than just writing "a city"!<br/><br/>I went for a simple, cartoony art style, to get the project done quickly, which then became the tone of the game.  So the tone of a textless game seems limited by the art style.  It would be much harder / longer to make a textless game with a grittier, more realistic, or more subtle tone.  One way to do it would be to use photographs.  My method involved repeating a lot of the images to create (hopefully!) a kind of symbolic language, so it might not be so bad to create a few high-end art  assets that get re-used throughout the game.<br/><br/>While I think the game would be playable, it would certainly benefit by adding text.  Even just a few words ("and, but, or, because") would make it much easier.  I tried not to use too many symbols either, but adding numbers and punctuation/mathematical symbols (?, !, &amp;, +, =, &lt;, &gt;, ...) would really help as well.  <br/><br/>I think the advantage of a textless game would be as a game for very young kids.  My friends' 5-yr-old is reading the Bone graphic novel, and is able to follow the story with only the pictures, because he remembers the story from his parents reading it to him.  So I think a comic form game for kids should still have text (for parents to explain to the kids the first time), but the kids could use the comics to reinforce / remind themselves of the rules and procedures while they play.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JoshDemers" title="JoshDemers"><img alt="JoshDemers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/703/nLX7QIP4KZECH.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JoshDemers">JoshDemers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420726/#Comment_420726" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-26T16:54:39+00:00" title="August 26, 2013  4:54PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/AllanDotson">@AllanDotson</a>: That is FANTASTIC!

The imagery leaves a certain amount of vagueness that I think would be fun to use in a game. I like games that don't have everything nailed down explicitly to leave room for creative solutions, and this does just that. <br/><br/>As for more examples, I would just go through it once and be done with it. The risk of having too many examples is that you imply that these are the only options one can have or that the characters lack ability to deal with a scenario outside of a certain context.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
