So far, we have played chapters 1-6 and the game is going great.  I had been looking forward to playing since the game came out and the four of have been trying to organize a game since OrcCon back in February.  Finally, our schedules aligned and we were able to play the first three chapters the week before last and the next three this past weekend at Gamex.<br/><br/>Initially I was interested in Grey ranks because it explored an obscure but fascinating part of the history of WWII.  In this respect the text is informative and entertaining, but Grey Ranks' strength is the intense personal stories you create when you play it.  I knew about this aspect of the game as well.  I had watched part of a session and heard or read several discussion about it.  But i had no idea just how great it was at giving you the tools to make these stories until I was there doing it myself.  The choices you make about your background, the traits your other players give you, the Radio Lightning scripts and the grid situation elements all come together and make you feel like situations were personally written for you and your group.  In reality they are just a loose collection of suggestions that help you create powerful stories.  When I say powerful stories, I mean in no other game have I cared as much about the characters and fiction as I do in this game of Grey Ranks.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146408/#Comment_146408" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T10:15:33+00:00" title="May 28, 2008 10:15AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2008 10:31AM by WillH.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Continued<br/><br/><br/><br/>I'll attempt to give an example, but it will be hard for me to do justice to the game here.  I'm playing Olek, AKA Wit.  Wit is 16 and grew up in the Ochta district.  Ochota is essentially the university district so I decided Wit would be the son of professors at the university.  At this point I also decided Wit's parents had been rounded up and killed by the Gestapo, but I chose not to share this with my fellow players yet.  For chapter one, we decided the Germans were making a propaganda film at a cafe and we were taking it upon ourselves to carry out the executions ordered by Radio Lightning.  The cafe is full of Germans and collaborators.  My turn for the mission scene comes around and Jesse tells me that as our plan to bomb the cafe is set into motion I spot one of my Father's colleagues.  I\u2019m not sure what Jesse thought I would do with this, but he seemed shocked when I went off on the professor for being a collaborator.  Wit said, "You are a traitor!  If you weren't they would have taken you when they came for my family!" and shot the professor in the chaos following the explosion.  This earned Wit the trait Cold.<br/><br/>Fast forward to chapter five.  So far things have been going well for the uprising and our little band of Boy Scout partisans, on the personal front we are all starting to have some issues. For Wit, this means he was unable to convince his little brother, thing held dear, to stay out of the uprising. Colin reads the Radio Lightning broadcast and it mentions some professors in hiding who the Germans found and murdered.  I look down at my grid situation elements and one of mine is a house full of German officers in Ochota.  Wait a minute.  It's like Jason saw into the future, read my mind and wrote this stuff specifically for me.  I asked if anybody would mind if i was mission leader for this chapter and everybody immediately said go ahead.  To introduce the mission I framed a short free play scene starting with us all huddled around the radio listening to the broadcast.  I tell them those professors were my family\u2019s friends and neighbors.  I know a house in Ochota were a bunch of officers are staying and that we're going to get some payback by barricading them in and burning the building down with them inside.  Colin, his character is also from Ochota, says "I know where we can get some petrol" and the mission was on.  <br/><br/>We start Colin's mission scene which is about getting the petrol when Laura jumps in with here personal scene.  She confronts Wit, telling him that it's wrong to kill, even Germans in cold blood like this.  This attack doesn't serve the uprising and killing just for revenge makes Wit no better than the Germans.  She rolls and succeeds.  So Wit is in turmoil about his actions and feelings.  Now Laura is reading my mind, because this was exactly what I was planning all along.  I rolled horribly on the mission roll.  Our target number was 20 and I think our initial roll was something around nine or ten.  We all really wanted to succeed here so everybody\u2019s thing held dear was either invoked or threatened and after the rerolls we pull it off.<br/><br/>The chapter closes out with Wit's personal scene.  Up until this point, Wit has lived up to the cold trait and has been acting fairly ruthlessly and I wanted that to start to change.  I frame a scene where Wit confronts a soldier who managed to escape from the burning house.  The soldier is begging for his life, saying he has a wife and child and that he was conscripted and just trying to survive the war so he can get back to them.  So the issue at question, is Wit still filled with hatred and kills the soldier or is he able to empathize and let the soldier live.  I use the d6 from my cold trait and succeed, letting the soldier live.  Wit is beginning to soften now.  This will probably result in him being torn apart from the inside as he deals with the horrors of war.  I can't wait.<br/><br/>Of course I'm skipping a lot here.  Jesse, Colin and Laura all have incredible stories about there part in the uprising.  We still have the final chapters to play, but Grey Ranks is already my best game of the year so far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146455/#Comment_146455" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T11:38:45+00:00" title="May 28, 2008 11:38AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Will, I've played the game myself many times, but I still couldn't help getting goosebumps as you described that final scene with Wit.

Did you use it tactically, or thematically?  Did position drive character motivations or scenes?  <br/><br/>Was there any discussion or knowledge of the history and events outside the stuff provided procedurally (Radio Lightning/situation)?  <br/><br/>Did you feel competing tension to succeed in mission scenes and to contribute to overall success?<br/><br/>Just curious.

Plus if I know I have to lose a personal scene I will deliberately make it that my character would much rather have won.<br/><br/>We didn't really speak of history or events, but we are all aware that things will end very very badly for our band.<br/><br/>For the tension to succeed in mission scenes - do you mean by contributing a low die? If so yes, sometimes we all want to succeed at our part of the mission, so we contribute a d4. This generally results in us needing to re-roll a die as a d12 latter on when invoke or threaten the things we hold dear.<br/><br/>And yeah, hard times a coming. I was able to play a one shot at Gateway LA last year and I believe we played chapters 6-8.

If you look at my posts around here and elsewhere I'm a big proponent of the player being the fictional character's advocate.  Even if everyone at the table wants the character to fail someone should be fighting for the poor non-existent bastard.  The dissonance that Grey Ranks creates for me is that I have four axises of character advocacy none of which are causally related within the fiction.<br/><br/>Axis 1) Personal Scenes.  Straight Up Roll The Die Achieve The Goal.<br/>Axis 2) Mission Scenes. Die Chosen Determines Success or Failure.<br/>Axis 3) The Overall Mission.  Collective Dice Rolls Determines Outcome.<br/>Axis 4) The Grid.  Maneuvering Determines Character Welfare.<br/><br/>One of the things I was very afraid of was being put into a position where playing the character's advocate on one Axis would mean playing against the character on another.  And while this is, in fact, part of the design I simply do not enjoy strategising for character failure.  However, Grey Ranks has pleasantly surprised me as I do make a distinction between strategising for failure and simply not working very hard for success.  At no point, so far have I had to put effort into my character's failure.  If it is in my character's best interest to fail due to the state of the grid I simply do not have to fight so hard for success which is more akin to simply not spending fan mail on a conflict that you're not very invested in, in Primetime Adventures.  I don't mind passively letting the cruel wheel of fate land where it may.  I feel unclean if I'm actively undermining my character.<br/><br/>The scene that really drove this fact home for me was in Chapter 6, I think.  Everything was wrapped up except for my personal scene.  Looking at the grid I wanted to fail my personal scene.  Looking at my sheet I had a d4.  And I thought, "Oh, I've already failed my personal scene.  I don't have to *DO* anything."  That was a very important distinction for me.  So I narrated my character attempting to break his sister's religious faith which I'd already established in the narrative is pretty much impossible to do.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146681/#Comment_146681" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-29T11:16:01+00:00" title="May 29, 2008 11:16AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Steerpike</cite>For the tension to succeed in mission scenes - do you mean by contributing a low die?</blockquote>\nYeah, that's what I meant.

I know you've articulated your preference before and it is an important distinction in general - I really think of <i>Grey Ranks </i>as a game in which the characters are not as important as the collective fiction.  The framework is pretty deterministic and the choices you make are not always oriented toward character success, as you have noted, by player design or by merciless fate.  I think it works best when everyone is in the mix all the time, meddling with the relationships and fates of the other characters as well as their own, with an eye toward service to the overall narrative.  I'm really glad that the line between actively pushing toward failure and passively allowing it is working for you!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike" title="Steerpike"><img alt="Steerpike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/73053145/4961238"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike">Steerpike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146690/#Comment_146690" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-29T11:31:47+00:00" title="May 29, 2008 11:31AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><cite>Posted By: Steerpike</cite>For the tension to succeed in mission scenes - do you mean by contributing a low die?</blockquote>\nYeah, that's what I meant.

I have been spending most of my time up at the love end of the grid.  This has been a big influence on my personal scenes.  It shows up through Wit's concern and love for his little brother and his courtship of Rivka, a female NPC member of our crew.  The only tactical choices I've made have involved singling people out.  I singled Laura out so she would not bounce straight from one corner to another and I asked to be singled out because i f I was going to be on a corner I would rather it be martyrdom than nervous breakdown, both thematically and because of the d12.<br/><br/>I know a fair bit of WWII history in general, and I have held my tongue a couple times when I some historical inaccuracies were suggested.  We're there for a game not to nitpick minutiae of history.  I've read a little more about the uprising on the net.  But my knowledge of the uprising doesn't extend too far beyond what is in the book.  <br/><br/>The mechanic of contribute big dice and fail or small dice and triumph can really hit you in the gut at times.  This really seemed to be true for us during the mission to burn the house in Ochota I talked about above.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146703/#Comment_146703" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-29T12:08:35+00:00" title="May 29, 2008 12:08PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's funny, I've had to develop an easy attitude about history myself.  Like the situation elements - each set of choices includes things that are specific (in my mind) to early or late in the game, as well as a lot of universally applicable stuff.  I played one game where someone chose "the ruins of my old bedroom" in chapter two, before the Uprising began, and I just had to smile and roll with it.  Maybe it had been ruined in some prosaic way, who knows, right?  At the same time I enjoy inserting little details from stuff I know that makes the setting pop, like suggesting a name for that random German officer or situating the action on real streets.<br/><br/>Saving Laura from the big switch was very kind of you!  That jarring transition is always rich story-meat when it happens, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146705/#Comment_146705" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-29T12:21:38+00:00" title="May 29, 2008 12:21PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I really think of<i>Grey Ranks</i>as a game in which the characters are not as important as the collective fiction.  The framework is pretty deterministic and the choices you make are not always oriented toward character success, as you have noted, by player design or by merciless fate.  I think it works best when everyone is in the mix all the time, meddling with the relationships and fates of the other characters as well as their own, with an eye toward service to the overall narrative.</blockquote>\nWhich is what a lot of people say to me when I'm so assertive about character advocacy which makes me think there's something I'm not saying right.  When it comes to the overall narrative, I'm as bird's eye as they come.  I'm constantly editing, angling and assimilating based on the narrative.  But to me, the pivot points of a strong narrative is when it's central characters encounter adversity.  I enjoy games most which have legitimate forces representing the parties in that encounter and don't leave one to be a straw-man/facade to simply illustrate something about the other.<br/><br/>I think this dovetails with Vincent's blog post about rules introducing the unwelcome and unwanted such that even if we're all committed to one particular outcome or another there's always the chance that some feature of the game will take that away from us and we'll be forced to evaluate that commitment in light of the unwanted flow of the fiction.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146706/#Comment_146706" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-29T12:42:26+00:00" title="May 29, 2008 12:42PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse, I think I understand your argument, and I agree.  I know that I want characters to matter in the course of a story, and that happens much more easily if one or more players are really invested in them.  In our regular gaming group, there are players that attach themselves to a character, and fight hard for their success, while others go through one tragically-ended character after another.  Both methods contribute to the fun and to the overall story, but I feel like the triumphs and the horrors that happen to the invested character is that much sweeter.<br/><br/>Although (as Jason pointed out) Grey Ranks isn't focused on character depth, I usually find myself adding layers of extra detail to my character and giving myself more to care about.  Most of the time I'll struggle to help them survive, or if not, give them enough attachments to other characters and significance in the story to give their failure a really big impact.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146721/#Comment_146721" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-29T14:21:07+00:00" title="May 29, 2008  2:21PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More Random Thoughts:<br/><br/>Everyone else is kind of up near the top of the grid, I'm near the bottom.  Which is funny because I'm very good at playing moody, broody, emo characters.  However, I remember saying, "This corner of the grid is easy to play but man is it hard on the dice."  D4 for Suicidal-Depression.<br/><br/>Also, because of my preferences I find myself wanting to keep my scenes, short and sweet and focused on whatever the key mechanical pivot of the scene is whether that's the success or failure based on donated die in a mission scene or the goal in a personal scene.  I tend to try and side-step other conflicts in the scene because there's no way to resolve them other than just to keep narrating.<br/><br/>For example, I've been playing my character as very, very protective of girls.  At one point it was Laura's mission scene and she was about to run out into the street under heavy fire.  I narrated my character grabbing her hand and insisting that the mission had gone bad and we need to escape.  I remember then IMMEDIATELY thinking, "Oh fuck, I've initiated a conflict."  Now it was Laura's mission scene so I just deferred to whatever she said next which was fine but I did have that little internal hiccup. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
