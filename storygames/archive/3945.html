While I'm not really a D&amp;D; fan (understatement there, heh), I do think this is an opportunity to make a better game. I hope it will be more .. coherent.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe D&amp;D; Insider stuff is clearly an attempt to gain a different income model. The influence of the MMO industry is pretty clearly seen in this. I think it's a worthy attempt and it will be interesting to see how the D&amp;D; gamer crowd takes to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all, 4ed to me looks more business savvy, but will the design also shine to make the game itself good?

A post I bumped into on ENworld that re-caps all news so far suggests there will be rolling 6 week classes to help you become "a better D&amp;D player."  I see an attempt to migrate the whole experience to the Internet. You find your group of players, you schedule times to play, hop online with GM and Players and do it.<br/><br/>I think it's a smart thrust for them. I don't know how well it it will play out, but I see lots of advantages to this set up.<br/><br/>It may not be set up around the MMO model -- but I do think this is their model to compete with it.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88383/#Comment_88383" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-16T10:44:35+00:00" title="August 16, 2007 10:44AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James McMurray</cite>So instead of memorizing spells in the morning, you have a certain number of slots per encounter, perhaps with a way to refresh those slots in the middle of the fight.</blockquote>\nI very much hope that this is the case.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nicklessguy" title="Nicklessguy"><img alt="Nicklessguy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nicklessguy">Nicklessguy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88384/#Comment_88384" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-16T10:45:25+00:00" title="August 16, 2007 10:45AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, this links a lot with Ryan Dancey's posts which have been <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3933" rel="nofollow">discussed recently</a>.<br/><br/>Does anybody know whether Dancey's doing marketing for 4e, as he did for 3e and 3.5?

It's like, it's like, NeverWinter Nights (the first one, five years ago) but without all the automated systems (monster AI, pseudo-real-time combat) that sped things up to the point of bearable! Oh, and without, you know, the graphics (textured dungeons, 360 degree camera angles, tons of ambiance).<br/><br/>Seriously, you'd think that if they wanted to put up a challenge against the MMOs, they'd make something that could compete in some small way. This is exactly what they say it is - an online toolkit, much like the half-dozen or so really good ones that are already out and have been for years. WotC might be able to increase the number of online players by providing their stamp of approval and a matchmaking service, but they won't be increasing the appeal of online play, at least not with what I've seen so far.

While it will be interesting to see if the experience scales, there was a vibrant, original NWN community that used NWN as a medium rather than a game, to run very tabletop style sessions. Hell, some of them even went to a scene model rather than a sim model and created places on the fly depending on where the next scene was. Not saying the DDI does this, it's just an example of the depth of the community. They also had sites that integrated great scheduling tools in so you could arrange sessions across timezones and have discussions forums and the like pre-game.<br/><br/>Basically, a way to take your gaming table, in some way, to an online format and schedule and play games with people around the world could well work.

"Challenging" MMOs isn't the aim, here. There are more differences between D&amp;D and MMOs than the fact that one of them is played in meatspace.<br/><br/>Look, I wanted to play a Ptolus D&amp;D game with a few of my friends who I knew would really get into it. We're all scattered across the country, so we found an online tool that emulates a map, miniatures, and dice (Maptool, in this case). <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=312458" rel="nofollow">This</a>is the result. It's been a total blast.<br/><br/>Without that online tool and modern VOIP programs, we wouldn't have been able to play the game. SImple as that.  And guess what - in some cases, the online version is easier to use than the physical equivalents. I don't have to buy miniatures - I can make little pogs out of any graphic. I don't have to built a battlemap - I can load a jpeg into Maptool. There's nothing to clear up afterwards. The dice never roll under the table, requiring someone be dispatched amongst the feet and nacho-fragments to retrieve them.<br/><br/>Maptool's great - but an equivalent program in 3D, that lets players create their own character representations, and has a nice visual representation of rolling dice, and links in character sheets, stats, etc? That's pure coolness.\n<blockquote>As for the on-line thing...could be very interesting. But then I have a unique view on this maybe, as I was involved in the NWN community for some time, and used the nwnconnections.com website. This had whole scheduling facilities that allowed games to be arranged, people invited, take care of time zones, provide campaign and session forums, etc. It was really good.</blockquote>\nYeah - nwnconnections.com was the best thing to happen to NWN. The mystery to me is not why WoTC are doing this, it's what's taken them so long.<br/><br/>I'm pretty psyched about this. I've loved the recent design direction of D&amp;D products (9 Swords is excellent), and all the snippets coming out about 4th ed. make me suspect that someone (probably Mike Mearls) has been furtling around in my geeky fantasies and is making the new edition of D&amp;D *just for me*.

Have been for half a decade at least. And D&amp;DI doesn't look like it brings anything new to the table.<br/><br/>The problem with such online toolkits, in my experience at least, is that they're quite cumbersome to use compared to everyone sitting around a tabletop. A good illustration of this is the YouTube video that shows the DM sketching a secret door into the dungeon map - 5 seconds with seamless results when you're sitting around a table compared to 30 seconds of messing around, with a horrible-looking end result, when you're using D&amp;DI. I can't imagine what will happen if the DM wants to do something more interesting, like create a fairly large random encounter. And I still don't know if this means the DM has to have registered his D&amp;D Minis with D&amp;DI to have access to the models and/or stat blocks.<br/><br/>NWN, while limited in scope and needing considerable prep work, managed these things much better by allowing everything to occur in real-time using the same automated systems the single-player game used until the DM pressed the pause key. Want to build a random encounter in NWN - set the game on pause, pick a type of creature (like "animals" or "goblinoids"), set a general difficulty level based on relative CR, and mark the area where the encounter will occur. You can also do all this ahead of time by drawing a trigger area, where when the PCs walk in the encounter spawns. Or you could roll your own random encounter using your own books and dice, then place specific monsters with specific stats and specific drops if you wish - it just takes longer.<br/><br/>If WotC wanted to do this "right", then they would increase efficiency where possible by using automated systems, to make up for the fact that many other aspects of play are hindered by an online approach. What they seem to be doing now is attempt to emulate the tabletop as closely as possible, with all of its inherent inefficiencies, while doing nothing to facilitate or compensate for the areas that will suffer (immersion, communication, tactile experiences, etc). Meanwhile, I maintain that the inherent gameyness of the online application, combined with the inherent challenges of roleplaying over voice or text chat, combined with the clumsiness of play will cause people to migrate towards online games with exactly the same benefits and challenges, but which feature better response times and easier grouping.<br/><br/>WotC has cash, a lot of it from selling D&amp;D licenses to companies like Bioware/Atari for NWN. There's no reason they should put out a product that is in many ways inferior to 5 year old games - and when I say inferior, I mean less playable, more cumbersome, with a lower appeal.<br/><br/>I hope, for WotC's sake, that they start integrating DM tools into D&amp;DI like random encounter generators, quick tile placements, fog of war, pseduo-automated combat, trap triggering, reference libraries, and so on. I see some promise in the application, especially when you consider prepurchased adventure modules complete with dungeon maps, preplaced figures, traps and loot, flavour text trigger points, etc. But what I've seen so far makes it look thoroughly unappealing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88557/#Comment_88557" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-17T07:58:52+00:00" title="August 17, 2007  7:58AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>No, D&amp;D is not an MMO and clearly, WotC wouldn't want to make it one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>What they seem to be doing now is attempt to emulate the tabletop as closely as possible, with all of its inherent inefficiencies, while doing nothing to facilitate or compensate for the areas that will suffer (immersion, communication, tactile experiences, etc).</blockquote>\nThat's it, that's it right there.

And that's just the obvious features we've seen on the little videos. The dicerollers on the gametables I've seen aren't animated either (I know that sounds petty, but I miss me those polyhedrals when I play online).<br/><br/>I'm not trying to be awkward - just suggesting that I think it *does* do some things other tools (especially free tools) don't.\n<blockquote>The problem with such online toolkits, in my experience at least, is that they're quite cumbersome to use compared to everyone sitting around a tabletop.</blockquote>\nAs I mentioned above - while there are certainly some things an online tool is more clunky at, there's things it's more efficient at too. \n<blockquote>NWN, while limited in scope and needing considerable prep work, managed these things much better by allowing everything to occur in real-time using the same automated systems the single-player game used until the DM pressed the pause key. Want to build a random encounter in NWN - set the game on pause, pick a type of creature (like "animals" or "goblinoids"), set a general difficulty level based on relative CR, and mark the area where the encounter will occur. You can also do all this ahead of time by drawing a trigger area, where when the PCs walk in the encounter spawns. Or you could roll your own random encounter using your own books and dice, then place specific monsters with specific stats and specific drops if you wish - it just takes longer.</blockquote>\nWoah there, mister! No-one loves the old NWN more than me, but those are some bold claims. The DM client in NWN was *incredibly* restrictive. It certainly didn't let you create or modify areas on the fly. You couldn't have added the secret passage in, like in D&amp;DI. And we haven't seen how D&amp;DI handles encounter-spawning, anyway, so there's no real ability to compare that.<br/><br/>I ran me a lot of NWN using the tolset and DM client. There's reasons I switched to playing D&amp;D using the books and an online tabletop program. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>\n<blockquote>What they seem to be doing now is attempt to emulate the tabletop as closely as possible, with all of its inherent inefficiencies, while doing nothing to facilitate or compensate for the areas that will suffer (immersion, communication, tactile experiences, etc). </blockquote>\nThey're creating something that looks like the D&amp;D everyone knows, that you can use online. Yes, online gaming has some issues, but it has some unique advantages, too. Also, I'd argue the online tabletop *does* have specific advantages when playing D&amp;D - pre-preparing battlemaps rather than having to construct them at the table, unlimited miniatures that you don't have to buy or paint, no tidying up afterwards, no worries about spilling coke over the map/cat knocking all the miniatures over, etc.<br/><br/>Now I've played D&amp;D using an online gametable there's no way I'd go back to doing all that stuff physically.\n<blockquote>WotC has cash, a lot of it from selling D&amp;D licenses to companies like Bioware/Atari for NWN.

The proper comparison is to other forms of on line play, like play by post, play by e-mail or skype games.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite><br/>If WotC wanted to do this "right", then they would increase efficiency where possible by using automated systems, to make up for the fact that many other aspects of play are hindered by an online approach.</blockquote>\nIf by automated you mean traps will spring when you enter their area or spot checks will automatically be rolled when you move within range then, I agree I hope they have that.  That stuff may or may not be in there.  They haven't shown enough to of the system to say one way or the other.  If you mean automated like NWN where you click attack, click on the monster and the computer does everything else, I don't want that at all.

That's my point.<br/><br/><br/>Oo - hang on. I didn't properly address this, and we might be talking at cross-purposes a bit.<br/><br/>There's 2 ways that the Insider gametable can be used:<br/><br/>1) For friends playing remotely, who otherwise couldn't meet up face to face. This is me. And for us lot, tools like Insider are simply the only way we get to play. Without it, no game. Now there are some issues using VoIP and stuff, but that's true of any online gaming, not exclusively of Insider.<br/><br/>2) As a replacement for a battlemap and miniatures at the table fr people playing face-to-face. These people don't have the communication problems of online play. And using an online battlemap thing isn't any less "immersive" than an actual battlemap and miniatures.<br/><br/>I think what I'm saying is that people who *can* play face to face will continue to do so, and use D&amp;DI as a supplementary tool, side-tepping the issues of online play. But it will also give a load of people who currently want to play D&amp;D but can't the opportunity and ability to do so.<br/><br/>Now, whether the simple experience of your PC becoming the medium for D&amp;D is likely to have people comparing it to MMOs all the time, and thinking "Well if I'm going to do something fantasy-related on my computer it might as well be WoW" I don't know. I suspect not. I've played me a whole lotta WoW and a whole lotta Guild Wars, and they scratch very different itches to the online D&amp;D game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88570/#Comment_88570" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-17T08:54:23+00:00" title="August 17, 2007  8:54AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2007 9:03AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Chris,<br/><br/>Thanks for the post.<br/><br/>As for point (1) my concern is this: A lot of money, effort and graphics going into <i>recreating</i> the look and feel of table-top gaming. For people like you and me (who grew up on this gaming), that's anything from really cool to sweet. But as far as I'm concerned it'd be a bit like scanning in pages of texts from books and <i>presenting them as the scanned pages of book</i> instead of finding new ways of using text on the internet that respect the way computers, the Internet, and readers of text on the screen actually meet in this new form.<br/><br/><i>My concern is not with a tool that does this</i>. It is how they are going about implementing it. It is, in my view, bad design.<br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>Because by shoving the retro-D&amp;D-recreation design elements in they're building something that will look and feel completely bizarre and alien at anyone who might stumble across D&amp;DI for the first time. Sure, again, for people like you and me -- sweet! But for some fourteen year old who grew up on the internet and will <i>most likely find D&amp;DI before he bumps into any D&amp;D books</i>, the only reasonable reaction to the "miniature bases" and the odd "rolling of dice" will range from "WTF" to "Well, I don't get what this is about," and move on.<br/><br/>Yes, yes, I know. It's "recreating" the experience of table top play. My point: the next batch of gamers WotC has to capture won't know something is being recreated. They won't have the reference point of what is being recreated. <br/><br/>In my view the design i's backward looking, nostalgic over forward-looking, and not what it could be in terms of SCRAPPING a lot of assumptions about what this potentially cool product could be.<br/><br/>I say this only as a man who is obsessed with what's happening with how we get our entertainment on the Internet, watches carefully how children are growing up with the Internet, who just closed a deal with ABC to build and anthology series for them for the Internet. In other words, in terms of strong minded design considerations, I'm being a cold-hearted-ass.<br/><br/>The fact that watching the video kind of tickled my heart doesn't change the fact that I know it tickled <i>my</i> heart -- because of all the associations I have with miniatures and markers and battlematts. (Battlematts... sigh.)<br/><br/>But the <i>new</i> audience -- which has to be part of the audience WotC is looking toward with this sort of venture, isn't me or you or anyone who wants that. They're growing up with the Internet first. And I think this isn't going to fly for them. The shame of it is, for me, is that I think there's a terrific product waiting to be built along these lines. But because, for whatever reason, there's a lot of baggage being dragged along, it's affecting the design parameters (the graphics, the tools, the mechanics), and I don't think it'll carry to the new audience.<br/><br/>As for (2), yes. But as Mikael said, and what about the old fashioned way?  If it's <i>easier</i> for me to scribble out maps and details on paper or a wipe-surface, then the new tool is a poor tool. And I didn't see anything that couldn't be done easier off screen -- from mapping to rolling dice. I know they're going to try to sell it this way. I think this will be lame. <br/><br/>The real coolness is in the virtual table-top stuff. And, per above, I don't think they're going in the right direction.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88571/#Comment_88571" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-17T09:02:55+00:00" title="August 17, 2007  9:02AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By the way, I'm not trying to argue anyone into agreeing with me on this stuff.<br/><br/>This is how I see it.

And yes, I think you're right. It doesn't seem designed in any way to pull in new people. I think it *will* reactivate some inactive people, but that's not hobby-growing. I understand your frustration, now.<br/><br/>For (2) we'll have to see what the final tools look like. But like I said, there *are* genuine advantages to online gametables. We had a line-of-sight issue last session that would have been solved beautifully by Insider (or even the most recent version of the program we use, if I'd remembered to update it. D'oh!) and that issue wouldn't have been solvable at all outside a virtual gametable.<br/><br/>A couple of other examples of advantages on-screen has over off-screen I can think of: You can put your encounter maps together in an online tool before play and whip them out instantly. In tabletop you need to clear the table and relay them.<br/><br/>A virtual tabletop has an infinite supply of miniatures, and getting a new one is a process of finding a picture online and downloading it. In tabletop we've all had to resort to "no, that d12 is the troll! And that d8 is the imp!" at some point. I'm sure this is the origin of modrons...<br/><br/>If we have to finish a session mid-fight on a virtual tabletop I can save it and we can pick up straight away next time. On a real tabletop we have to find some way to record where everyone was, 'cos the maps and miniatures need to be packed away. And we need to note down whose turn it was, and how long was left on spell effects and stuff for next time.<br/><br/>There's a few things like this. I can dig if people don't think these outweigh the tactile and other advantages of doing it old-school. They certainly do for me, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88576/#Comment_88576" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-17T09:14:42+00:00" title="August 17, 2007  9:14AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Chris Gardiner</cite>I understand your frustration, now.</blockquote>\nQuick clarification: Not frustration.

We always play a hacked version cross between 2nd and 3rd edition, with our own rules for magic etc. when we play. But when we play AD&amp;D, we want combat that takes place smoothly, hassle free, with crazy situations that would never fit or WANT to be incorporated into a paltry 2d mapsurface. I think it's absolutely ludicrous that there are so many people which focus on AD&amp;D as being a game designed to be played with miniatures. And I've played a few huge dungeon crawl demos at cons with miniatures for AD&amp;D. Guess what - they SUCK compared to some of the other miniature games out there. WEGS for example, does everything that AD&amp;D fails to do when it comes to gaming that is designed to be played with miniatures. To me, WEGS and AD&amp;D scratch completely different itches. WEGS is that miniature oriented, I want a tactile feel to what I do, and AD&amp;D is just another option in the horde of miniature-less gaming choices that are available. I mean who plays Savaga Worlds, or Shadowrun, or d6 Star Wars, or Cthulhu, or Rifts, or any other of a number of games with miniatures? Not too many people! Because the games are designed to bypass the miniatures entirely. Does it seem like the story-game community is being divided into two between the duality of miniature, and miniature-less gaming? What's the deal with every person on the planet using miniatures to play AD&amp;D. Is my gaming group the only one that says NO! to miniatures for this game? What's going on here people?<br/><br/>Online D&amp;D sounds cool, but it immediately loses its appeal when you get back to the simple point that, YOU"RE USING MINIATURES IN D&amp;D. I mean, Never Winter Nights online were cool ass games. I used to play NWN when it was online AOL at $3.99 an hour! Sure, it was a freaking cool game. But that's a video game. It would be cool if a live real-time DM could control the units, and plan out stories, but let's face it, that's not what is designed to be done in the heart of role playing. For real RP you need tabletop. Anyone who thinks online gaming is superior to offline gaming just hasn't had the right experiences, or hasn't played with the right gaming groups to really be able to appreciate everything that it can be. Sure, online gaming can provide much needed games to people who don't have a group locally, or who want to play when their groups away, but still, let's be realistic. It's all just second hand options, compared to sitting down with a hardcore group of gamers (your friends) and pummeling out a game, WITHOUT THE MAP OR MINIATURES. Am I the only one who sees it this way? Maybe everyone has been dazzled and blinded, because AD&amp;D has gone the route of miniatures ever since the evil corporate giant Wizards of the Coast took over TSR's beautiful baby, and turned it into a miniature money making profit machine. Miniatures make more cash people, that's the way it works. Of course WotC is going to push miniatures to no end in order to promote their game and make oodles of money in the process. But then the game suffers.<br/><br/>If I want a cool miniature game, play one that was designed for it. A game like WEGS which is currently the living breathing reincarnation of awesome in our gaming group. AD&amp;D in my mind will always, and forever be, a miniatureless game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88964/#Comment_88964" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-20T15:08:42+00:00" title="August 20, 2007  3:08PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Still your mouth heathen!

Not only did we see a lot more use of previously marginal abilities (tumble, combat reflexes, reach, sneak attack), but we got a lot more exciting, <i>characterful</i> combats as well.  Diving through combat to heal a fallen party member is a much greater statement when the minis on the table tell you you're going to be wearing a half dozen attacks to do it.  One person holding the line against impossible odds, to protect a weak spellcaster or rogue is cooler when you've got a clear representation of exactly how hard it's going to be.  I was really sceptical about minis, because I thought that the physical models would replace my mental image of the fight, but using sufficiently abstract models and scenery (we just use a gridded white-board) means that isn't an issue.  <br/><br/>Ok, maybe we can get back on topic now?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elmago79" title="elmago79"><img alt="elmago79" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i44.photobucket.com/albums/f41/doguiii/rdh12.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elmago79">elmago79</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89033/#Comment_89033" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-20T22:19:49+00:00" title="August 20, 2007 10:19PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: LordZoma</cite>Ok, am I the ONLY person here who has played AD&amp;D a billion times, and would NEVER EVER EVER even HALF CONSIDER playing it with miniatures?</blockquote>\nNo, you're not.

Part of me really likes the idea of D&amp;D as a miniatures game where character creation is similar to building a deck of magic cards with a bit of roleplaying on the side. Part of me is against the idea of emulating play better suited by other mediums. Part of me likes the idea of D&amp;D as a nebulous rule set that can be finessed to match anyone's play style. Part of me likes Paizo's approach on focusing more on story vs. pure encounter elements. I'm conflicted. I'd almost wish they would release 2 different D&amp;Ds.<br/><br/>IH didn't scale well for us as we went up in level in terms of tracking the various fiddly bits. But that's also relative to the specific players engaging with the system. The podcast issue was related to discussions of character builds in terms of feat trees and maximizing probabilities minus any situation or story context. Manipulating feat trees at higher levels is almost a different game in itself. The focus on that and hearing talking of getting rid of social attributes didn't inspire me. It all interests me, but for me, I don't want D&amp;D to just be about that.

Because you have to be a D&amp;D Insider member (or already have a gleemax account), I'll paste the text here:\n<blockquote><br/>4th Edition dragons are among the most dynamic, exciting monsters in the game\xe2\u20ac\u201das they should be. They\xe2\u20ac\u2122re different from each other, across categories (the metallics aren\xe2\u20ac\u2122t like the chromatics), across colors (reds and whites don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t have all the same attacks), and across age categories (fear the ancient dragons). Here\xe2\u20ac\u2122s just a taste of what a fight against an ancient dragon might feel like:<br/><br/>    * On the dragon\xe2\u20ac\u2122s turn, the first thing it does is burst out in an inferno of flame, searing every PC within 25 feet\xe2\u20ac\u201da free action. Then, with a standard action, it slashes out at the fighter and the cleric with its two front claws (even though they\xe2\u20ac\u2122re both 20 feet away). As another free action, it uses its tail to slap the rogue, who was trying to sneak up behind it, and pushes her back 10 feet. It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s getting angry at the wizard, so it uses a special ability to take another standard action: it spits a ball of fire at the wizard, setting him on fire. It has a move action left, which it uses to fly into a better position for its breath weapon. That ends the dragon\xe2\u20ac\u2122s turn.<br/><br/><br/>    * It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s the fighter\xe2\u20ac\u2122s turn. He charges the dragon and manages to land a solid blow, dropping the dragon down below half its hit points. Oh\xe2\u20ac\u201dthat gives the dragon the opportunity use its breath weapon as an immediate action. A huge cone of fire bursts from the dragon\xe2\u20ac\u2122s mouth, engulfing all four PCs. But at least the dragon is below 500 hit points!<br/><br/><br/>    * Now the rogue moves around to flank with the fighter. Ordinarily, that would let the dragon use its tail slap again as an immediate action, but the dragon has used its immediate action already. That\xe2\u20ac\u2122s lucky for the rogue, who actually gets to make an attack this round! Unfortunately, she fails to hit the dragon\xe2\u20ac\u2122s AC of 49.<br/><br/><br/>    * The wizard fails to put out the fire, so he takes more damage. Worse yet, the dragon\xe2\u20ac\u2122s breath scoured away the wizard\xe2\u20ac\u2122s fire resistance, so he takes the full amount. He blasts the dragon with a ray of freezing cold, but this isn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t 3rd Edition. The dragon takes normal damage, but it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s not enough to slow it down.<br/><br/><br/>    * Finally, the cleric is up. Calling on the power of her god, she swings her halberd at the dragon\xe2\u20ac\u201da critical hit! The damage isn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t bad, but even better, the wizard gets a nice surge of healing power.<br/><br/>      He\xe2\u20ac\u2122s going to need it\xe2\u20ac\u201dit\xe2\u20ac\u2122s the dragon\xe2\u20ac\u2122s turn again.<br/><br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89552">\n<div

It implies that the Cleric is somehow healing the Wizard by attacking the dragon.  Whether that's a special effect of a spell, the critical hit, or what, I don't know.  In any case, I like it.  When there was talk about keeping the Cleric in the healing "role", I was worried that it was going to be the same old "don't cast any spells that could be used for healing" malarky.  This sounds like maybe they've got some interesting ways of letting the Cleric actually do stuff while providing healing to the party.  I'd love to see some effect that lets the Cleric dish out healing in the normal course of play, rather than as a dedicated spell.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89691/#Comment_89691" name="Item_112" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T06:31:11+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  6:31AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>It implies that the Cleric is somehow healing the Wizard by attacking the dragon.</blockquote>\nThat's how the D&amp;D board game works.
