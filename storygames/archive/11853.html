Do you love games but hate having a social life?!?!?!?! Do you want to earn the adoration of five middle-class, educated white men?!?!?!?!?!?<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>The Contest:</b> Produce a finished RPG in ONE YEAR!<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>The Requirements:</b> During the contest period you must produce a concept and a design. You must then playtest said concept and design. Then you must write your game. Then playtest your game again. Then rewrite your game. Then playtest it again. Then edit it. Then playtest it. Then lay it out. Then playtest it. Then fix all the broken shit you missed before. Then edit it again. Then polish it and abandon it because even though it's still broken and worthless, you can't work on it any more.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>The Deadline:</b> You only have ONE YEAR from the day you start. Start any time, but once you kick off this contest there's no going back -- win or lose.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>The Prize:</b> Your prize is a complete, polished pen-and-paper, tabletop roleplaying game that you designed! In addition, you'll earn the approval and admiration of up to five white men in their 20s or 30s! Even better, your mother or girlfriend will make disapproving signs and wonder why you're wasting your time on this when you could be doing something more productive. Best of all, should you complete the contest and meet your deadline, you will be awarded a small, greasy dollop of Self-Respect that you can use to smear on yourself to ward off future bouts of Fear of Failure.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Meet The Judges:</b> Look in the mirror! You're the only judge! How cool is that?<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Entry Fee:</b> All of your free time and as much money as your ambition can stomach.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/marknau" title="marknau"><img alt="marknau" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c29/marknau/dwarf.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/marknau">marknau</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264641/#Comment_264641" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-31T07:51:57+00:00" title="March 31, 2010  7:51AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm always playing this game, and I don't really feel like I'm ever truly winning.<br><br>"A curious game, the only winning move is not to play." ???

Seriously, compared to other contests I've participated in, this one is emphatically NOT any form of "hardcore," no sir.<br><br>First thing: a whole year? Ridiculous. Who else runs a successful year-long contest? Nobody. Take a few cues from non-gaming writing contests and keep it to a month. That's some accomplishment right there!<br><br>Second, there's no length specification! Sure, sure, you don't need to pick an exact page count like Jake Richmond did (I mean, god forbid, then somebody might expect you to read all those pages!), but specifying a range or a list or required sections is the least you can do.<br><br>Third, judging. As an example, several days after the judge for the Second Annual Kult Scenario Contest received all entries and closed the contest, he <i>disappeared from the internet forever!</i> Of course, how can we expect you to pull a move even half as classy as that? You even stated up front you're not judging the contest! Even Jared can manage to judge contest entries, even though he doesn't read them, and he was a much bigger asshole about his contest (another area you are failing in).<br><br/>Damn It, Sir.

It's like...the main game is a hot-rod I'm building, and a contest is spray-painting a garden chair, so I can test out how to apply colour to metallic surfaces. Plus, if I'm working on, say, a game about the circle of trust between space truckers for a year+, it might be nice to just make a small game about pulp treasure hunters and their impotence.

So thank you.<br/><br/>However, I still think there's a place for game contests. They're the 13-mile run before the marathon. Or, for some, the series of quarter-mile runs to get into shape. <br/><br/>There's some kind of weak anthropic principle that people who are successful at designing games were probably the type of people who were gonna be good at designing games in the first place. Now, that's also a cop-out, because those people worked their asses off to become successful, but there's a shred of truth there, too. I believe that everyone can polish and publish a fine RPG if they work hard, but not every designer is capable of Dogs in the Vineyard or Burning Wheel. However, the path to Burning Wheel isn't to enter a contest and then give up on the game after a couple weeks.<br/><br/>Contest games are like the fashion runway. No one actually wears that shit. It's experimental and crazy and obscene and totally impractical, but other fashion designers see the colorful fabric hung on too-skinny models and get new ideas. Then they go do real work. Contest games are often impractical and unfinished, but also contain great little gems of ideas. We need to take those ideas to the next stage, though. Contests are great, but we can't stop there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265117/#Comment_265117" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-02T08:43:56+00:00" title="April  2, 2010  8:43AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread needs more image macros.

However, why do you find it problematic that people are creating these contest games that are sucky by the standards of productized, end-user playable industry? Do you think that we should label contest games more clearly as being incomplete concept sketches, or do you think that the very act of creating them is harmful to the designer or the community, no matter how clear we are on the fact that these games should not be compared with finished product?<br/><br/>I'm asking about this because I've personally gotten a lot out of game design competitions. Graham's Little Game Chef last year, for instance - I could name roughly half a dozen of those games as ones that gave me new ideas and insights; in fact, I was just yesterday working on figuring out whether JW's <i>Mare Caspium</i> might have a kernel of an idea that would actually be pertinent for a game I'm working on myself. Do you think that I'm deluding myself by thinking that I can learn anything from these quickly brainstormed, unplaytested concept games? To me it seems that the goal you cite - creating better games - is admirably serviced in part by the rabid, unfiltered exchange of ideas that a contest environment encourages.<br/><br/>I have some memory of you (or perhaps somebody else?) fielding this same critique of game design contests before, that they're bad because the games created for them are hasty, untested and not at all quality-controlled. I just don't understand how this is a problem for something that is not intended to pass those standards you set for them. Why can't a game contest advocate just shrug and ignore your critique, agreeing that a properly published game needs to achieve a much higher standard that is not doable without long-term work of the type you advocate, but also noting that this has nothing to do with game contests? You're simply setting arbitrary standards that are inapplicable to the goals of game design contests.<br/><br/>Without a straight and clearly outlined argument about what's really wrong I can't help but find the sort of ironic bitching this thread encapsulates to be rather frustrating; Luke just seems very, very bitter about something, but can't quite say it without using a forced simile like this "Design an RPG in 365 days" contest. Is that really an effective way of saying something that most any actually experienced game designer is going to agree with, anyway? Wouldn't it be better to talk directly about the topic itself?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265119/#Comment_265119" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-02T08:46:51+00:00" title="April  2, 2010  8:46AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 2, 2010 8:55AM by Bret_Gillan.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is interesting to me how much overlap I am seeing between the indie RPG community and the indie video game community, with not much conversation going on between them: <a href="http://www.indiegames.com/blog/2010/03/gdc_rant_please_finish_your_ga.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indiegames.com/blog/2010/03/gdc_rant_please_finish_your_ga.html</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265126/#Comment_265126" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-02T09:09:29+00:00" title="April  2, 2010  9:09AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude.<br/>\n<br/>\n3:16.<br/>\n<br/>\n3 months of contests begat an amazingly fun game that's gotten a lot of play. Sure, the signal to noise ratio was rather low, but no lower than the various games that aren't made as part of a contest. I know there are other games that came out of contests that have been polished up and published as well, though I've reached my level of interest in researching them.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, contest games are largely shit. That's part of the point, though. Vincent Baker once said something along the lines of having scrapped a dozen or more games for each one he pushed through to publication. Contests are just one outlet for making those dozens or more games that get scrapped.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, sure, so there are people who think that because they've designed a game for a contest, that they are now successful game designers. Some definitions of independent game designer do allow for that conceit.

Insofar as you're talking about people publishing and charging money for bad games, how could you be wrong? But then, insofar as your point concerns games that are not intended for comparison with published titles, what's the point in offering external measures the designer does not care about or need at this point of his work? What I mean is, this concern about game design competitions seems completely besides the real point, which seems to be that creating polished games worthy of publication and public commendation is hard work that bears little resemblance to the sort of work done in game design competitions. This seems obvious to me, I don't think that anybody contends otherwise. If somebody does - or better yet, if somebody actually publishes bad games without a development stage out of misguided confidence brought about by competition - then surely names can be named and the issue directly addressed. You're criticizing the idea of game design competition for something that doesn't seem to exist in my experience, so although I appreciate the values you offer, I'm not seeing how they have anything to do with the institution you criticize. Where are those bad games that hurt gaming culture, and why are game contests responsible for them instead of naive designers without a solid understanding of what is expected of them?<br/><br/>Also: why do you act like you're in a pigsty? Don't you have any respect for the people you care to address here? I know that you have other conversational modes aside from snide irony and hate-spewing rants, so why not utilize them here? You obviously want to teach and guide people in game design, but is that really going to succeed by insulting them, making fun of their best efforts and picking undecorous fights over nothing?<br/><br/>Incidentally, I agree with Luke about 3:16 being unrefined. I don't have similar hang-ups about polish (postmodern publishing environment and all, in the future all the best stuff will be unpolished anyway), but much more importantly I don't really see any connection between 3:16 originating in a competition and it's being published as a rough text. The only game competition that insists on a hasty development schedule is Luke's "Design an RPG in 365 days", and insofar as I know 3:16 didn't participate in that <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>To be clear, I don't think that the value of game design competitions is in the games that originate in them and that are then developed into finished products. Still, one of my own favourite rpgs ever, <i>The Mountain Witch</i>, was originally a contest game. The same goes for <i>Polaris</i>, <i>Ganagagok</i>, <i>It Was a Mutual Decision</i>, <i>Space Rat</i> and probably several others that I can't be bothered to remember right now. Some of those are rough, some are rather polished (and proven so, having performed through several years of intensive play). I don't find it credible that originating in a contest has much to do with the game's final quality; much more important is what you do in the actual development process that starts after that first draft that may or may not have garnered high marks from the ultimately arbitrary judges of that contest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265177/#Comment_265177" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-02T11:42:51+00:00" title="April  2, 2010 11:42AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            System matters, Eero.

Is that a problem, though? I mean, it's a different type of publication with a different audience, different expectations and different goals, so of course the process of creation will be different as well. It's like a jamming session vs. musical performance, I wouldn't expect anybody to argue that jamming is bad because it's not a concert.<br/><br/>That aside, the point about hasty design is interesting - would you tell us more? To me it seems that you're going to get hasty, badly thought out and uncritical design from a contest. However, this same process also allows uncritical, creative, unconstrained design work that focuses more on showcasing an approach or an idea than building a complete game out of it. It's like the difference between brainstorming and goal-based analytical development; you brainstorm to get ideas and viewpoints, not to get a finished and rationally defensible product. To me it sounds like you're arguing that a game created for a contest is not only unrefined and hasty when it comes out of the contest, but it's also always going to be that - the contest background permanently mars the project. Is that what you're saying?<br/><br/>I guess that what I'm arguing for is that game design contests have historically proved their worth by being venues of communication and idea exchange between game designers, as well as sort of platforms for design spec and goal-setting. Sometimes the contest can even be seen as a sort of design manifesto on the parts of some designers, they're writing about their long-term intentions and what they think that roleplaying games should be like. The fact that they direct this writing at themselves and other designers able to read drafts seems pretty sensible to me; the polished games made for the actual audiences will come later. I've even seen people use the contest framework to work through problematic ideas, and I've done that myself; the aforementioned Little Game Chef last year did a lot of this regarding the concept of immersion, as can be expected. Considering these many functions that have nothing to do with creating polished, finished games, it seems unfair to use the existence of the latter to criticize design contest games, which are entirely different types of entities, or at least very primitive stages of a development process, not finished work at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

It's a game that does a bunch of fun stuff, clearly, but I can't enjoy it in its current form, despite being quite familiar with its source material \u2014\xa0probably more so than most US players.

I think it's a bit premature to say that what we have today is all bad. Aside from IGC now and then, I think that Ron's contests from a few years back were pretty good. I also liked the Little Game Chef, at least for me it was an useful experience. (I hope that it's granted that I know what is useful to me at this point - I'm not exactly naive about game design.)<br/><br/>Obviously the social context will influence how useful a contest will be, but to me that seems like an argument for better designed contests and better social environments for them, not for avoiding contests and mocking them for not being a completely different thing. Perhaps we need more long-term serious design and less short-term concept work, but if this is the case, I don't think that attacking the whole idea of game contest is the right way to go about that. Much more to the point would be to get constructive with the people who actually need the long-term process. This will not be everybody, and nothing is certainly going to happen by bitching about design contests, which are a different issue from doing meticulous game development.<br/><br/>Foremost, though, this is the bit on which I disagree with Joshua:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C. Newman</cite>But they don't all produce things that are then refined by their creators until great, and they could, if they were designed to.</blockquote>\nThat seems like an unwarranted optimistic statement. How on earth are you going to transform the idea of a game design contest into something that consistently causes people to refine their games into finished products? Keep in mind that many, probably a majority, of the participants in a contest are not entering with long-term development in mind. The idea of a contest in the first place is not to create something you're going to publish, it is to keep an open mind and see what you get by just starting to write within constraint, with no expectation of long-term commitment to the project. This being the case, how would it even be beneficial if you managed to transform the design contest into this entirely different thing that caused people to do long-term development?<br/><br/>To me this complaining about game design contests and other rough draft game design reads like complaints about freestyling rap battles. After all, you could be doing records, why would you choose to do live improvisation instead? I think that the best single defense for the freestyle of game design is that I like it - it's interesting to read new ideas because game design, too, is my hobby. It's a different thing, and I find the entire idea that we should somehow eradicate rough draft game design and publishing to be suspect. Without draft design I wouldn't have <i>Yonder Knights</i>, <i>Mare Caspium</i> and other similar experimental drafts to look at when I'm considering my own next step in design.<br/><br/>Also: it seems that a hidden assumption in these discussions is that draft design in design contests and such is somehow energy taken away from serious product development. I find this a curious assumption for which I'd like to hear more arguments. Taken on its lonesome I find no reason to believe this to be the case, unless you count any activities outside proper product development to take away from this most important work. If that is the case, though, then I guess we should all get rid of any other hobbies we have as well so as to not disturb our game development work. It's simply not an argument against design competitions that it takes away from development if that is what people want to do instead, at least not in a free society.<br/><br/>("Rough draft game design", I like the sound of that. A bit more general as a concept than just game design contests, which are only a part of the entire phenomenon of writing and publishing games in incomplete form.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265213/#Comment_265213" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-02T13:19:54+00:00" title="April  2, 2010  1:19PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ken Sentowski!</cite>Paul<br/><br/>It maybe a cultural gap, but that doesn't make it acceptable.

I don't know if it's feasible to interpret them as generic reward machines, though; as the current IGC seems to indicate, for instance, the things that make a contest work don't seem to translate very well to long-term aspirations. That makes sense, really, if you stop to think about it: the rush of the contest is in the short-term transformation of reality, like a carnival, not in giving you a long-term framework. Seems that way to me, anyway.<br/><br/>Then there is the issue of whether we might even want to have competitions focused more on productized design. As I've touched on above, I think that there is value in the undergrowth of draft design as well, it's culture with unique value (albeit perhaps for only a small specialist audience). Trying to harness the superficial institution of design competition for purposes contrary to the impulses that originally created the institution seems like it might go awry rather easily.<br/><br/>Also, insofar as I understand the events of IGC 2005, what we had was a bunch of young designers ready to write their first serious game all participating in the competition at once. That's what caused the superficial success of many games being developed long-term, not anything particular about the competition itself (well-formed as it was). I'd probably have joined the wave (did a few pretty interesting games for the competition, myself) if I didn't have my hands full with rpg translation projects for the next couple of years. The lesson is that it was not the competition that caused games to be made, it merely grouped together a bunch of people ready to make a game. Game-making was not the primary fruit of that competition, just a coincidence brought about by the contest being held at the Forge at a certain point in time. Create a Forge-like community and hold a competition at a time when many designers are looking for direction, and you'll duplicate the phenomenon even without getting too smart about the competition design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bevedog" title="bevedog"><img alt="bevedog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stevelawson.name/icons/steve-in-3D-32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bevedog">bevedog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265226/#Comment_265226" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-02T14:00:59+00:00" title="April  2, 2010  2:00PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's very interesting to me that people took offense at Luke's original post.<br/><br/>I read it and thought "this joke contest is exactly what I need to get off my ass and play with the idea I have for a solo game.

The few times I could bring myself to poke my nose into the RPG.net game design forum, I saw the same thing on a grander scale. Some of the games I've seen born and die in threads on the Forge were heartbreakingly cool ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow does a few contests here and there compare to that much failed potential?<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething that contests do, *I* believe:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. They give you the idea that you CAN design a game, rather than endlessly tinkering with ideas<br/>\n2. They give you constraints and a goal (Do this, with these elements, in this amount of time: GO!)<br/>\n3. They allow you to come up with ideas that you might never have done without the aforementioned constraints.<br/>\n4. For a brief time, they give you other people who are at least somewhat invested in what you're doing, because they're doing it right along beside you.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you find all of those things without contests? Absolutely. But it's hard enough that there is more rough than diamonds.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have participated in exactly two design contests: The original Ronnies, and Jared's game company thing. I found both experiences rewarding, and I'm proud of what I managed to accomplish in both contests. Do I think Rats in the Walls or Sexy Deadly are by any means polished, ready to go commercial games? Absolutely not. I'm still plinking away at playtesting with Rats, and unfortunately, the rest of Team SD has no desire to continue working with that game, but I think both games are worthwhile endeavors. I designed games that I *never* would have come up with without the constraints of those contests.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265239/#Comment_265239" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-02T15:10:31+00:00" title="April  2, 2010  3:10PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chairman Mao says LET A THOUSAND FLOWERS BLOOM!!!<br><br><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_k6SB4qwGB6g/Sm0YaCQWvpI/AAAAAAAACI4/RTCcIUEURx8/s400/wang-guangyi.jpg"/><br><br>Andy Warhol says art is wasted space.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265245/#Comment_265245" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-02T17:11:04+00:00" title="April  2, 2010  5:11PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, for serious, though.<br><br>Luke, the main problem with your objection is that your contest doesn't work for a beginning designer. This has been proven time and time again. The classic example is the experiment with pot-making classes. The students in Class A concentrate on quality. They are making one pot and work on it until it is perfect. The students in Class B only concentrate on finishing in a timely manner, no matter what the quality of the pot is. When the semester is over, the students in Class A still don't have a decent pot. The students in Class B have made dozens of shitty pots, but by the end of the semester, they can make a decent pot in a short amount of time. This is true of all creative endeavors. Adam actually makes this point in the other thread.<br><br>"The Community" does not make games. People make games. Just because some people, who are part of a community, made good games, doesn't mean first-time designers suddenly start making better games. Individuals have to works through their shitty pots before they can start making good ones. Any system or community of critique, testing, and revision worth its salt is going to support that.<br><br>Second, if your attack on game design contests is actually serious, you fucked up. We haven't had any contests around here for quite a while (in internet time), but you just started some. Of course, if you're trying to ironically spur on more contests... uh, good play, actually!

But dont worry, I've stopped tring to correct my mispellings so you dont have to consider what i say, but stay safely on the side of persona and names. <br/><br/>The reason i listed what im woking on iz because someone mocked my writing rather to the point of insinuating i didnt do any. BUt yeah case in point, someone who spells lik tis onta internets is getting published and putting out games and doing their best. I'm glad you find that amusing. Its almost as if what i writ here im my spare 5 mins have nothing to do wit my skillz. <br/><br/>As for luke, the the tiredom of explaining jokes, remember humour is the last defence of cynicism. The Cutting Mockery, the name calling, the personal attacks, the quibbles and mobbing, the cool dismissing that YOUR actions DONT HAVE TO BE EXPLAINED because man, explaining a joke is a drag. Its a neat rhetorical device, and all i have is my call to content, investment, and production versus your all too cool to be bothered to explain or defend. <br/><br/>Na-Nu Na-Nu                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

This works out well for me. In short:<br/><br/>- Not using your real name and spelling things horribly are not good reasons to not take someone seriously. Being a jerk is a good reason to not take someone seriously.<br/><br/>- Luke is occasionally perceived as a jerk, but he's also smart and knows his shit, so it's worth taking him seriously.<br/><br/>- Therefore, if you want to be taken seriously and still be a jerk, Logos, get some brains and know your shit.<br/><br/>Special bonus opinions!<br/><br/>- Game Chef was pretty awful this year. Note that this does not mean there are less games coming out this year. I think that, hopefully, most people now realize the gorge between contest games and finished, publishable games.<br/><br/>- I think\u2014 and this will make me super unpopular, but oh well\u2014 that if you pitch your game-in-progress to everyone you know, and no one wants to play it, you should re-evaluate whether you want to publish it in the first place. I think Joshua is smart but, in the other thread, has his playtesting timeline ass-backwards. If you can't get friends to try your game for one night, if you bring your game to cons and no one signs up, it's not because you "don't have a name" or "refuse to participate in indie-wank bullshit" or any of the other consolation prizes you give yourself: it's because your game just doesn't sound interesting.<br/><br/>Now, do you want to spend a frustrating year trying to build the perfect system for a concept no one wants to play but you? If not, polish your pitch, find your hook. If you do that and still can't find enough people who know and love you to give your game a shot, there's no way strangers will. Time to go back to the drawing board.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

Our community currently produces underdeveloped games. One of the premier venues for the production of underdeveloped games (by volume) is contests. <br/><br/>My design process has nothing to do with this, really. On the other side of the tracks, RPGs are worked for years and they're still underdeveloped. Contests are not the only thing wrong with RPG design. <br/><br/>If the product of the act of design is your happiness, you're doing something wrong or you shouldn't be a game designer. <br/><br/>Contests are great at stirring up the pot and creating energy. This I do not deny. But I feel that at this juncture in time, this community/movement is in desperate need of mature, polished, considered designs. Firing shiny forgettable games at our audience is only going to tire them out and make them look elsewhere for a more meaningful, lasting experience.<br/><br/>-L                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265462/#Comment_265462" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-04T14:02:12+00:00" title="April  4, 2010  2:02PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Luke explains the joke.... and it's good!<br/>\n<br/>\nI found myself sighing through many of your earlier posts in this thread, Luke.

I also wish a lot of games were more developed, especially commercial games in fancy hardcovers or boxed sets that promise me a great experience on the cover but end up showing, through play, that their creators haven't considered very basic issues or done basic playtesting of certain aspects.  Your games aren't like that and that's because of your commitment to the development process.  I wish every commercial RPG publisher developed games like you do, including both mainstream and indie publishers.  When I pick up an indie game and can't figure out how to play it well, that upsets me even more because I know it's going to be someone's first indie game and they may throw their hands up and go back to Paizo or whatever.<br/><br/>However, for me personally, contests were vital to becoming involved with indie games, both as a player and designer and as a participant in other ways (going to conventions, editing Push, talking with folks about publishing).  While they definitely don't teach you everything you need to know about developing a project to commercial publication, they allow folks to get their foot in the door and, if the contest is structured well, end up with a very early draft that they can play with their friends and consider working on further.  I do think that the attention during contest periods gets leveled on the flashy design portions and not the hard work and frustration that comes with later development.  <br/><br/>I also think that the SG community, in particular, is focuses on the bursts of creativity that surround early design and play, not really about heavy playtesting and development.  The Forge is probably better at discussing playtesting and revision than SG is, and that's no surprise.  SG, on its best days, focuses on the fun and excitement, not the frustration and work.  SG was founded to be "the Forge lite / year-round Birthday Forum," right?  There are some more solid discussions of design, playtesting, and revision that are happening <a href="http://www.story-games.com/praxis/" rel="nofollow">over on Praxis</a>, SG's new design-focused sub-forum, but it's still equal parts serious design and the kinds of early brainstorming / blabber that used to get thrown up on the Forge's Indie Game Design forum.  That may just be the nature of the beast.<br/><br/>Also, since I'm running Game Chef now, having taken over from Andy last year, I see my main job as not getting rid of contests but trying to make Game Chef as successful as it was in 2004 or one of the other periods when it turned out drafts of games that would later go on to be revised and published with great success.  Honestly, I'm not 100% sure how to do that, as last year's disjointed experiment proved, but this year I'm planning to be more minimalist in an effort to capture the power of the concept.  Overall, perhaps, our goals are not too dissimilar, in that I want to make the games that result from contests better, even if that means cutting down on the number of designers and the number of games produced.  Really, quantity and quality are too different goals, but both are important to making Game Chef work.<br/><br/>Can I pick your brain a bit?  What would you like to see happen?  Would you like to see zero contests to distract from the real work of revision and playtesting?  Would you like to see better contest games that are worth developing into polished games?  Would you like to see more people committing to commercial publishing rather than throwing up short, free PDFs?  Does <i>Lady Blackbird</i> make you mad or is it a model for people who want to design but don't want to be Luke Crane?  What can I, as the guy organizing Game Chef, do that would make you happiest? (Not that I will necessarily do it, but I am interested in being helpful).                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265469/#Comment_265469" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-04T14:45:52+00:00" title="April  4, 2010  2:45PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Speaking of which, what the hell has happened to The Forge?

I'm speaking as a designer/publisher who has interacted with a lot of customers/fans about a lot of different RPGs. My opinion may be that of a jerk, but I am a particularly well-informed jerk.<br/><br/>I would like to see honest game design. If something is hack work, own it. If something needs polish and testing, do it. Don't think that just beause you came up with a great idea for a game and wrote it up that it's done. One of the beautiful mysteries of games is that you can't truly know them until you play them a lot.<br/><br/>I loved your Raven contest because of the way you rated the games. Only a tiny fraction of the games were given the Baked rating. The level of feedback that you gave each designer was invaluable. Those people better be sending you Christmas cards for the rest of their natural lives: "Dear Jay Walt, thank you for helping make me a better person. Hope you had a great year. Signed, Dilettante Designer."<br/><br/>Lady Blackbird is an awesome idea, but it's unpolished. It requires institutional knowledge to make it go smoothly. Same with all of JH's similar designs. They are brilliant RPG design sketches. But this is a topic for another time.<br/><br/>My favorite recently published game is Danielle Lewon's Kagematsu. It's 90% there, but it's a great 90%. It really just needs more usability testing for the materials and a handful of the instructions. All the processes themselves seem to work. And that's what I'm talking about Danielle did the absolute best she could -- after years of development -- had no other choice but to release it. Now she can take the release data and absorb it. Her next game will be even better.<br/><br/>-L                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265473/#Comment_265473" name="Item_112" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-04T15:09:35+00:00" title="April  4, 2010  3:09PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a fair opinion Luke has there, when delivered without unnecessary bitching.<br/><br/>My own take on the perennial topic of game quality is that vigorous critique combined with offering access to the tools and methods necessary for creating quality are the best vanguards of continuing high standards. In other words, I rather think that bitching about bad games by name in public is effective in not only putting a rogue designer (ironic, that one) straight, but also in developing and explifying the community standards on which the critique is based. This still has nothing to do with game contests, I just don't see any connection between the two topics aside from the totally unsubstantiated idea that the people doing contests would somehow turn that same energy on long-term game development if we only found the right influence. Might as well claim that actual play reports are the work of the Devil, being as how they turn hobbyists onto creative writing instead of the good work of game design. There is just about as much connection in my eyes.<br/><br/>Putting that aside, though, I'd love to see Luke put his social image on the line by coming out and listing designers and games faulty of underdevelopment. I have my own opinions, but I suspect that my judgment of quality is much more case-subjective and amenable to the postmodern publishing environment than Luke's, so it'd be interesting to see where he finds underdevelopment. Heck, I can totally tell right now that the <i>Solar System</i> booklet I've been selling is totally underdeveloped by traditional book industry standards: it's not a book, its planned shelf-life is just a couple of years, it was written quickly and in retrospective, it's intended to be replaced by new treatments whenever anybody gets around to writing any... that sort of project is so different from traditional notions of quality that in many ways it's smack dab in the middle of any perceived cluster of underdeveloped games.<br/><br/>I do understand if nobody particularly cherishes the chance to say specifically who and what this trend of underdevelopment consists of, but to my mind it'd be an immense step forward in addressing the issue (which has been around for a while now) if a thread like this started by calling out the people responsible instead of deploring the sorry state of the hobby in general. After all, if we have this impulse of commitment that makes us care about the scene of indie game design in general, then wouldn't it be fair to address the people you're trying to manipulate directly? Seems that way to me, even if it might bruise a few egos.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>It might be interesting to look at how I view this trend of underdevelopment myself, incidentally:<br/><br/>To me it seems that this trend exists - as Luke says, this community produces underdeveloped games. However, I don't see this as much of a problem, for several reasons:<ul><li>The changes in social communication have turned game design into a hobby this decade, a hobby where you can participate on many levels and in many ways. Rough draft design is the equivalent of writing fan-fiction; it's not intended to be published by a real publishing house, it's just something you do with your like-minded Internet pals. In time the best fanfic-writers will maybe go into real writing, and that is good. But accusing fanfic of reducing people's commitment to real writing work seems ludicrous to me; it's just the nature of the culture today that people not only consume, but also create, often in rather amateurish and fickle ways.</li><li>Looking higher up the totem pole, one might argue that the real problem is not that drafts of unplayable games clog the Internet; the real problem is that this community has started producing and publishing real games intended to compare with quality product that are of a more uneven quality than they used to be in (some idealized) past. To me it seems obvious that this sort of thing has started to happen because the community has grown and the number of designers has increased, which also means that there are more first-time designers, and therefore more bumbling. One might argue that the culture supports bad design practices, and I would agree to a point - but putting the fault entirely on that isn't necessarily something I'd accept without thought and discussion. Are we seeing established and successful designers abandoning quality in favour of quick esteem-boosts from subquality game design, or are we seeing naive beginner designers making mistakes? The latter phenomenon has become more pronounced because designers (beginners especially) are better connected than before, and thus a game that would've been quickly forgotten alongside its creator ten years ago will get some short-term traction on the forums of today. This might make it look like there is more underdevelopment today, but it might be that we're just seeing the old mistakes brought to light better than before.</li><li>Finally, the world and our relationship to texts is changing. Game texts are no exception. Unless somebody explains to me what "underdevelopment" even means in relation to game texts, I can't begin to form an opinion on whether I find it problematic. Is it just that games are published today in different state of polish than in years past? Is that it, really? I'm asking because that seems like a pretty minor issue in this day and age: when the requirements of publishing sharply decline and the amount and type of product people buy or otherwise consume is in flux, is it really a negative thing if people experiment with different standards of quality and expectation in their roleplaying products? Of course it sucks if somebody publishes a product that looks and feels like it fulfills some certain standards against which it ultimately fails, but what about products that set new standards? Luke says that underdeveloped games suck, but even sucky things might have a fair place on the market - in music, literature, comics and even filmmaking low-quality garage operations have a niche as a place for cheap innovation, outsider art, learning and other things. How is Luke's argument against underdevelopment different from a Hollywood professional declaiming shoe-string reality television because it makes the art form of film look bad?</li></ul>\nNow, I have to say that it sucks to see a game that's not all it could be because the production team failed in some way. <i>Misery Bubblegum</i> is not as good as it could be, to pick an example of a product where the production process has clearly left a large blind spot that causes real trouble for the customer. I'm not saying that this sort of thing does not happen, but is that, specifically, what is meant by underdevelopment here? Dragging game design contests into it seems like underdevelopment is more than just failing in the production process, more like it's an intentional strive to create things that are sub-par in comparison to finished product. But how is the latter a bad thing? How is it a problem if I put some rules ideas on my blog and tell anybody interested to take the stuff and run with it? I understand that Luke doesn't like unpolished, unproduced design floating in the Internet, but is there some reason for that aside from just not appreciating the stuff yourself? To pick another comparison (I've been going through these, I know), isn't summarily judging against draft design culture and for concerned polish similar to judging against punk music and for professionally produced pop music? There used to be a time when punk was condemned for intentionally forgoing the publishing standards of days past. If other people find playable (or otherwise enjoyable, for that matter) material in going through a different development cycle than your own, where is the problem?<br/><br/>Luke's answer to the above sorts of musing seems to be that our audience is in desperate need of mature, polished, considered design. Offering them an entryway into the underground of non-guaranteed hobby design will frustrate them and tire them out, directing them to other sources of entertainment. This might be right for a certain type of audience. Am I wrong in questioning whether everybody is interested in this audience, and would it be an unlikely proposition to think that the two phenomena can live side by side? I still think that it sucks to buy a game at Gencon and find out that it's underdeveloped, but connecting that to something like design competitions where the product is intentionally delivered in a context where it's obvious that it's not competing with traditional quality in mind - what is that about?<br/><br/>(I should note that I find nothing wrong in Luke speaking up for what he likes and what he believes to be best for the community culture, even if I'd like it if he were more considerate in the way he speaks. I'm just pointing out that the seemingly universally acceptable call for more polish and disdain for unfinished, flighty design culture might be hiding assumptions and ignoring values that might be important to consider for every one of us in thinking of Luke's mission. I don't really know what I think about rough draft design culture, but if the comparison to punk music holds water, then I think that there are rather good reasons for desisting from condemning other hobbyists just because they want to do game design that doesn't account for your own standards of taste.)<br/><br/>Finally: I agree with Jonathan's cross-post, seems like he's singing from the same hymnal I am on this, whatever I might think about what he's doing to IGC. As for Luke's cross-post, didn't account for it in the above - but rest assured that no Internet stupidity is intended, I'm taking this topic as fairly and seriously as I can.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265477/#Comment_265477" name="Item_113" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-04T15:21:36+00:00" title="April  4, 2010  3:21PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Considering Luke's latest, I find it rather reasonable. I agree about Jonathan's raven contest (from which I've yet to receive feedback myself) and about Kagematsu, and about the general thrust of things.<br/><br/>Luke: what I'd specifically like to hear about is, what do you think about the defence of the underground that I paint above? I don't think that we particularly disagree about what makes a good published game, it just seems that you're insisting that everybody who wants to work with game design has a moral responsibility to create games up to that affixed standard or keep quiet. This seems screwy to me in a society that is, if anything, embracing a fracturing cultural scene where manyfold things are published for manyfold purposes. I guess what I'd like to understand is whether you're saying that everybody needs to conform or shut up or the more reasonable (to my eyes) view that if you want to make finished product of highest quality, then certain standards and processes have to be maintained, and going through a game competition is not it.<br/><br/>Because I can totally agree that game competitions are no substitute to actual development work. That should be obvious to anybody who's ever actually published a game. Different functions for different purposes. No reason to demonize game competitions for something they're not and they're not claimed to be, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265482/#Comment_265482" name="Item_114" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-04T15:32:36+00:00" title="April  4, 2010  3:32PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So Luke has totally sold out to the establishment.

I agree with everything you wrote there.  A well-informed jerk is the best kind and pretty valuable to have around.<br/><br/>I think those folks would send me Christmas cards about Murderland if I'd ended up finishing all the reviews.  But, yeah, that contest rocked and Game Chef will definitely be much more like that this year.  I'm gonna pull a Mike Holmes and review all the games personally again. Also, there will be zero/minimal organized discussion of the games until folks have actually turned in drafts, which I think has honestly been worse for the contest.  Design happens in isolation.  The stuff you need a lot of feedback on happens later.  So, yeah, hopefully that will help.<br/><br/>So you're not against hacks or unpolished design as long as it's labeled such?  Cool.  I would hope that nobody's trying to pass off unfinished or only-works-for-certain-audiences games as other stuff, but maybe that's idealistic.  I'm sure people do get excited or attention-seeking and just throw stuff out there without qualifications.<br/><br/>Eero, I'm not gonna touch the naming-names issue. People keep saying we need that, but it doesn't help unless it comes in the form of volunteering to help other folks make their games better.  If you're not willing to stick out your neck for another designer, talking shit about them on the internet doesn't really do anything.<br/><br/>One issue, I think, is that there are two audiences for design: people who might want to play your game and other game designers.  Designing to get the attention of other game designers is gonna do nothing for other audiences and Luke's probably right that it muddies the waters a bit.  After all, other game designers are also people who might want to play your game, so if you treat them as a subset of interested players, you can design for them too.<br/><br/>Another issue is the thing you mention, about unstated assumptions about what makes games better or more polished.  Honestly, I expect Luke is totally willing to have his conceptions challenged about what a polished game looks like, even if he has certain ideas, as long as people can prove that their game is worth his while.  He's a player too, after all.  It's definitely one of those things that each person knows a more polished game when they see it, when it's obvious that care, time, attention, blood, sweat, and tears went into it.  It's hard to tell people how to do that, of course, because we each have our own methods, but, like Luke, I suspect that blood, sweat, and tears are hard to fake.  If it's there, it's obvious; if it's not, you can tell, even if the style of the game isn't for you or there are some other subjective bits.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265486/#Comment_265486" name="Item_116" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-04T15:57:08+00:00" title="April  4, 2010  3:57PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2010 3:59PM by John_Harper.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Luke: Right on.

I won't say that they're good things, but they seem like the sort of things Luke's after here. I know that I'm going to think twice about publishing anything if I know that Luke's going to be on it with a sledgehammer, screaming for accountability in the name of the common design standards, for instance. (Joke here, note.) It seems rather straightforward to me - if somebody is actually, concretely, in the real world doing bad game design and you want to do something about it, it only makes sense to me to speak about it to that guy or perhaps to everybody in an effort to point out the trend and warn against it. This vague bitching about somebody somewhere creating undeveloped games - what is this even, I don't understand who or what is referenced, so I don't even know if I agree or not. Guilting me about liking game design contests doesn't really seem like a more productive way of addressing the underlying issue, frankly.<br/><br/>(I should note that I do not talk shit about other designers and their games because I don't think that there is anything particularly wrong about them, not because I secretly seethe against their games but can't be assed to say it out loud. There are games I don't like, and I say it when it's pertinent, but the ones that I'd characterize under my standards of propriety are rather few. Perhaps I just don't have a discriminating enough taste.)<br/><br/>Also, I think that leveraging institutional knowledge (re: Lady Blackbird) is hard rock, and very much the context in which contest games are usually considered, too. You don't write the obvious things when you're under an unrealistic deadline, you write just the cool bits. The experienced reader (another designer) can add the common stuff himself well enough. This isn't even any sort of finished vs. unfinished game thing, this idea that people read game texts in context; <i>Zombie Cinema</i> is one overpolished design that totally relies on board game culture assumptions in how the text is approached and interpreted, for example. Does the fact that it's not intended for a given specific audience mean that it's underdeveloped? Does the fact that every text everywhere ever has been written towards a specific audience background mean that they're all underdeveloped? Does the fact that certain purposes and audiences require less polish mean that game texts developed for those audiences are bad? I think that this is probably not what's intended, but who knows.<br/><br/>Oh, I'm much too interested in this topic, and I'm probably smelling authoritarian modernism where there isn't any, anyway. Hopefully something good comes of this discussion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265494/#Comment_265494" name="Item_119" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-04T16:30:26+00:00" title="April  4, 2010  4:30PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I would have published a shitty, half-baked game by now if it weren't for some of the conversations here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265497/#Comment_265497" name="Item_120" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-04T16:41:51+00:00" title="April  4, 2010  4:41PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bret: You and me both.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265503/#Comment_265503" name="Item_121" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-04T18:01:54+00:00" title="April  4, 2010  6:01PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm still working on my half-baked games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265513/#Comment_265513" name="Item_122" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-04T20:29:26+00:00" title="April  4, 2010  8:29PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2010 8:30PM by JDCorley.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just a side note from someone who really likes Story Hyphen Games Dot Com - I'm not here to help you design your game, I'm not here to design a game, I have no interest in game design, the whole topic makes me want to go and do anything else in the world.

A film is generally a one-time consumption experience, thus the market can bear endless new packages of what is more or less the same entertainment.<br/><br/>A single RPG encapsulates the manifold production model of the entire film industry.<br/><br/>I think all the production of new games in our hobby is a great thing.  But in certain corners (this being one of them), it starts to feel like a bunch of players, all of whom suddenly have a desire to GM.  Kind of makes it hard to run games.  Also creates conflict.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the single game as standalone text that is the dominant paradigm here obviates all the other ways that producers could possibly be contributing to the community.  There are so many other ways to be a contributor.  I like Joepub's suggestions, for example.  Also, adventure, module and supplement creation.  The way people are making playsets for Fiasco is quite interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265589/#Comment_265589" name="Item_132" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-05T09:42:14+00:00" title="April  5, 2010  9:42AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite>Sentence 2:  There are enough games out there now, possibly too many; designing games should not be the hobby's priority.</blockquote>\nI find the notion of the hobby having a priority (or even its audience having a uniform or even predominant priority) kind of difficult to imagine.

Furthermore, there's no such thing as too many games.<br/><br/>Exactly. That's what I've been after here: to even discuss about directing the hobby or community in general to act in a certain way, you'd first have to construct an agenda, get everybody to ascribe to it and then go into accusing design contests or whatever about running counter to the agenda. That's a long way to go when we're talking of people doing things because they like doing them. Even if you yourself think that there are too many games, how do you justify making demands of others to stop designing or only doing it in approved ways? Last I checked, writing games was a legitimate form of self-expression that isn't hurting anything, except perhaps efforts to present the hobby scene as something that it's apparently not (considering that a need for change is perceived at all).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265598/#Comment_265598" name="Item_134" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-05T10:24:22+00:00" title="April  5, 2010 10:24AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, what I'm protesting against is the agenda and/or priority that is going on already.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265603/#Comment_265603" name="Item_135" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-05T10:47:14+00:00" title="April  5, 2010 10:47AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite>Actually, what I'm protesting against is the agenda and/or priority that is going on already.</blockquote>\nI think you're going wrong when you talk about it as <i>the</i> agenda. It's an agenda some people share. It's an agenda that maybe seems prevalent to you. But from what I can see, S-G can't really be said to have a consensus for or against the creation of new games.

So, yes, if -- like me -- you're taking the perspective of someone who wants to see more publishing successes, there are too many games. <br/><br/>If you're coming from the mode of personal expression, great. I'm for that, too. I don't see any reason for the abstract hobby to somehow curtail creativity and expression. <br/><br/>It's funny, I think Luke should like having a bunch of contests that get all gummed up and produce oddball games. It means those people aren't spending that same time filling up broader spaces of his market. It's keeping them busy over in the corner! I'd laugh about this more if I wasn't more serious about it.<br/><br/>One thing I'd love to see more of is people identifying games to support. Grow the Fate community more, for example. Or, seek out partnerships with, oh, BW headquarters, and tap into existing know-how to play games. Rather than having to re-invent the wheel over and over again. More of that, especially on a larger scale, would probably go a long way toward publishing successes, while still tapping at least some of that personal expression stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265605/#Comment_265605" name="Item_137" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-05T10:53:27+00:00" title="April  5, 2010 10:53AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It just seems that there is a lot of meta-talk around the concept of designing games and less actual advice and practical discussions, which suggests to me that for some all the stuff around designing games is taking precedence over the actual design of games.  That stuff around designing games tends to create social dynamics that I personally do find do harm to the overall community of RPGs.<br/><br/>But I'm going pretty far afield.  I would like to see a slight shift of production energy from designing unique stand-alone games to stuff that supports existing games.  That was really my point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265621/#Comment_265621" name="Item_138" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-05T11:43:42+00:00" title="April  5, 2010 11:43AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that directing your creativity towards building upon what already exists is a fine sentiment. It's partly a matter of methodology, though; game texts are used radically differently in traditional and Forge-style indie gaming, and one of the differences is that in the indie approach it's often easier to express your creative work as a new thing, a new game, even if it is largely built upon work started under some other title by some other designer. It's easy to think up things to do relating to an extensive game like D&amp;D, while "supporting" a smaller game will become forced pretty quickly. This is especially the case for the many people who appreciate complete transparency in the goals, rules and methods used in playing a game, myself included; I simply won't be bothered by playing Call of Cthulhu anymore, no matter how hacked - I'll rather construct a new system to directly tackle whatever it is I want to accomplish rather than trying to work around the existing baseline. A certain type of relationship with the game text (very boardgame-like, as I intimated) leads you to a situation where you find it easier to learn new, clearly written game texts than the opposite process of adapting more and more layers of methodology on a single base method. Starting from the very basics every time with a critical eye, that's a big part of what makes the indie design movement powerful in design methodology.<br/><br/>That being said, I don't want to be absolutist about it, I'm definitely on the side of promoting the good work and not wasting your time on being special for special's sake; it's strictly the resulting quality of play that I'm interested in. This is why I've been promoting TSoY lately, I think it's the best pick out of the field for what it does. I'll choose between creating a new game and supporting existing effort based on strictly merit.<br/><br/>It is true that commercially this means fracture to some degree as old games inspire new games which inspire even never games. Reducing the effect is sure to be an interesting challenge, and I think that it's being partially overcome by the way people play more different games in shorter campaigns, buy more and in general treat roleplaying games more like boardgames, not labels you staple to your chest for the next decade. Indie gamers of today are likely to have many, many more independent game texts in their library than your average D&amp;D gamer, but they won't have the stack of sourcebooks, adventure modules and other support material the D&amp;D guy has - ultimately it's going to be a wash, I think, with both buying and using about the same amount of product. It's just different type of product.<br/><br/>Whether the small games we see today in the indie field are likely to have lasting impact, it's difficult to say. They're not major works by any standard of cultural history, not in the sense that D&amp;D or Paranoia or Cyberpunk 2020 or other such classics of the form are. I would perhaps compare these games to short stories: not many are going to have lasting impact on their lonesome, but when perceived at a distance we'll be able to group them together, see similarities and treat the entire phase of design as an unified work, albeit one with dozens and dozens of authors. Sort of like pulp literature in that way. The sort of large game you design for five years and support for another 20 is in comparison more like a novel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265667/#Comment_265667" name="Item_139" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-05T14:46:53+00:00" title="April  5, 2010  2:46PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeh, I was totally all "fuck you telling me how to do something I love." I agree that it would be cool for people to support existing games (like, how rad is it that I've only written one of the four Guided Play Scenarios for Annalise? wicked rad, is what it is).<br/><br/>But also, how many people want to be actors or filmmakers or comic artists or novelists or whatever, who talk about it a lot but don't actually do it? I don't think people who read a lot, and talk about writing, and sometimes start a novel but don't really have what it takes to finish it are really infringing on the novelists who are publishing. Again, different activities, really.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265679/#Comment_265679" name="Item_140" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-05T16:20:38+00:00" title="April  5, 2010  4:20PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nathan nails it right there.
