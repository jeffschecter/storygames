It seems such a strange contrast and I'd like to explore it. (Related, but different, threads touching on this include  <a href="comments.php?DiscussionID=5219" rel="nofollow">Play by Blog</a>, <a href="comments.php?DiscussionID=2137" rel="nofollow">A tabletop RPG is an activity for the medium of roleplaying</a> and some parts of <a href="comments.php?DiscussionID=5430" rel="nofollow">Indie Promotion Sucks</a> appologies for any repetition).<br/><br/>A bit of background<br/><br/>I used to run a couple of forums where a lot of RP went on in a rule-lite or rules-less environment. The first was the website of the UK roleplaying club GEAS, which was used extensively by a number of groups in the mid to late 90s. The most notable of these were various factions of the UK LARP organization The Gathering, who did downtime RP and meetings on the forums. There were also plenty of non-affiliated gamers who used the forums for social RP. I think at one point we had around 30 different games going at once, some posting in excess of a 100 posts an hour (which made it more like IRC than a forum really).<br/><br/>At much the same time I ran a MUSH called The Halls of Marble, which was primarily a social RP venue. Unlike the GEAS forums the Halls had a rule system, with built in commands to support various skill tests and the like, but they were very seldom used. It interested me greatly at the time, in fact, how resistant people were to allowing such elements to "get in the way of their RP" in contrast to tabletop players, who are much more accepting. I played on a few other RP based MUSHes with rule systems and the attitude was much the same.<br/><br/>Slightly later I ran The Scorpion's Sting, which was an RP environment for the L5R world. The Sting was a little like a combination of a forum and a MUSH, with different boards representing different areas of the Inn of the same name (e.g. a board for the main hall, a board for the garden, a board for the rooms). That had a similar style of RP but less volume.<br/><br/>Currently I run a child-friendly virtual pet game, and it too has forum based (and private messaging based) RP going on, in much the same sort of way as those older boards did, except that since most of the players are children they tend to last for less time and have more fights (between players, rather than between characters) in them.<br/><br/>What links all these efforts is that they had a high volume of RP (involving 10s or 100s of people posting 24 hours a day), with basically no rules as we would normally understand them (even where rules were available). They were definitely roleplaying. People had characters, they spoke in character, they respected the environment, they went on adventures and fought monsters, but they did all that without stats, skills, tests, checks, traits, character sheets, or anything else usually associated with the process of RPGs, and without any reference to established characters from existing fiction to use as a hard guide of what could or could not be done.<br/><br/>There were, of course, rules, in the less traditional sense. Rules about play contracts, about what you could and couldn't do to someone else's character without their agreement, or a third party, or a detailed fight scene. Rules about what sort of themes were appropriate and so on, but they were almost all unspoken, and therefore hard to track or be sure about. Just like the classic cowboys and indians examples from many RPG books the RP on these fora was full of "Bang you're dead! - No I'm not!" scenes, and it didn't seem to matter at all! (Very occasionally people would get banned, or suspended or leave in a huff over misinterpretations of these implicit rules, but that was rare).<br/><br/>So why do our games need rules, and theirs don't? Or put another way, what sort of rules do they need that we could provide? Or what sort of rules do we have that they just don't need? Or are we playing two different sorts of things, and if so why?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123612/#Comment_123612" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-01T03:06:33+00:00" title="February  1, 2008  3:06AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How I see it is:<br/>\n<br/>\nRoleplaying doesn't need rules.<br/>\nGames, by definition, need rules.<br/>\nRoleplaying games, therefore, need rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123613/#Comment_123613" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-01T03:16:35+00:00" title="February  1, 2008  3:16AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so what is the difference between a Roleplaying game and Roleplaying like done on these forums?

It had a very complex online game behind it - with a lot of email communication between players within clans, councils, harpies and plots and what not. It had about sixty people involved. The live aspect of it was like a touring game, travelling from area to area and holding 'court' when it landed in your town. It was VERY good. The roleplaying was exceptional. However it was NOT a game. People loved it because it was like being part of an active theatre production. The game took them through the downfall of an old and desperate vampiric despot and they could be THERE, at the points that mattered and experience the drama. Even though everyone knew exactly what their characters could and could not do 'in game terms' that wasn't what the experience was about.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've played in quite a few wrestling e-feds as well and these worked under similar circumstances. The players understood the genre and the conventions that come with it and they knew that it wasn't about everyone always winning and being the champ. Being an exceptional heel who would inevitably be toppled by the Face challenge was more necessary than finding a loophole to 'technically' stay as champ. Just like in the Vampire game the social conventions of the genre were there - strict established boundaries from the moment of buy-in to the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123616/#Comment_123616" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-01T03:32:37+00:00" title="February  1, 2008  3:32AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You are basically talking about freeform improvised play.<br><br>It may not have explicit (written) rules, and dice/stat mechanics. <br><br>But by definition it has System.<br><br>Otherwise, if it's simply shared narration, well, it's round-robin narrative/creative writing (or improv live theatre).

These forms of RP certainly do have players creating a character and having ownership over it, promoting that character's goals and agendas against others and other trad elements. They do not do shared story. Indeed in these games the setting is often largely unaffectable by the players, because it is some function of the environment.<br><br>As an example one of the boards I ran was an Inn. That gave a setting (there was a picture of the main room, people knew who the staff were and so on) which players never changed. They might start a fight, spill a few drinks, and maybe knock over some tables, but that was it. If you left the Inn you left the board, and no one would have burnt it down, or replaced the owner, or whatever, because it was not in their control. In many ways I think similar things happen in WoW (though I've not played) because you get an environment given to you.\n<blockquote><cite>renatoram</cite>When there is a conflict in what player/writer A wants in the story and what player B wants in the story, who decides, and how?</blockquote>\nWell there's the rub, sometimes they don't, sometimes they argue it out in character, coming to a resolution basically by force of argument, and sometimes they decide OOC and then have it happen.

That is, games that don't have conflict resolution and/or social combat rules.<br/><br/>Since there is no explicit rules support, people argue (indefinitely) in character.  Or, as they say "roleplay it out".<br/><br/>Also, lots of people I've met think that's the one true way of resolving social conflict, and that using explicit rules (dice, skills, tokens, whatever) is wrong and breaks "good roleplaying". <br/><br/>If, OTOH, it is decided with an OOC agreement we are back in the "collaborative story writing" camp, IMO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123631/#Comment_123631" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-01T05:10:26+00:00" title="February  1, 2008  5:10AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I propose an experiment!<br/><br/>How about someone starts a thread over on <a href="http://snailspace.forgreatjustice.net/" rel="nofollow">Snail's Pace</a>, and anyone who wants to can go over there and play.

Any kind of roleplaying (Or even round-robin freeform narration) has rules, even if it's something basic like "Everything is ok as long as nobody complains" or "No stepping on other peoples characters". They can be informal or they can be explicit, but there are rules probably just as hard if not harder then in any RPGs-as-we-know-them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123642/#Comment_123642" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-01T05:47:52+00:00" title="February  1, 2008  5:47AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 1, 2008 5:48AM by Graham.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, this is one area where, I think, the theory developed on the Forge is bloody good.<br/><br/>So, there's a concept of "system". The system is, basically, the rules by which you play the game.<br/><br/>But it needn't be written rules. It can be conventions, like in those online games: things like "You can't kill another character" or "You can't contradict someone else's narration".<br/><br/>My experience with online games (which isn't much), is that, as everyone's said, there are <i>loads</i> of rules. Some of them could be written down (don't handle out-of-character things in-character). I think you could probably write down those rules into a rulebook, if you wanted to.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123651/#Comment_123651" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-01T06:35:58+00:00" title="February  1, 2008  6:35AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well I'm quite happy with that answer Graham, and indeed I tried to approach this with no preconceptions about the answer.

I was an active member of an online freeform community for a good long while. These conventions that are mentioned here were strictly enforced and explicit rules in the setting I played in. They weren't strictly enforced by a GM or any such thing (though moderators did exist to explain things to new players, answer setting questions, and to utilize their banning powers if things got out of hand) but by the community of players. The rules were basically: <br/><br/> Each player had complete control over their character, and any additions to the setting that they introduced.<br/> Introductions to the setting that did not step on anyone else's toes, or violate established fiction were good to go. <br/> React realistically to the events around you, even if it means you get hit in a fight. (this was subtly enforced; "god moders" got identified and cold-shouldered pretty quickly)<br/> Don't be a dick. You can initiate scenes with people without necessarily asking first, but if you're unsure that it's welcome, ask first.<br/> Stick to the setting. It was open enough that many things were allowed, but certain genre conventions ended up being hard-coded because people abused the flexibility. <br/><br/>These are, like most rules, all about apportioning credibility; who gets to contribute to the SIS, and if there's a conflict, how is it resolved.<br/><br/>Anyway, I may have more to say later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123656/#Comment_123656" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-01T06:52:22+00:00" title="February  1, 2008  6:52AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The question is, "need rule" or "need agreement" in order to do what?<br/><br/>I disagree, from my experience playing thousands of hours in chat and forum environments, that those games always have rules or agreements.

In most cases they're unspoken. In many cases they change as players develop different styles.<br/><br/>Now, if you want to have a game with as little out of character conflict as possible, you'd benefit from an agreement, an official policy that players agree they adhere to in cases of conflict.

Are we looking at these groups from a sociological/anthropological point of view, or are we trying to define what they do, or are we trying to explain their behavior in terms of what is familiar to us in the tabletop world?<br/><br/>If you read Christian's post, there may be no rules. Some may argue that there's still "system" in play (by here meaning the social conventions of Cute Girl Anime Character Player A not being able to engage in raping/killing Cute Girl Anime Character B, etc) which I would agree with, but aside from semantically establishing links there's nothing much to be gained from going: "System? <b>System.</b>"<br/><br/>I've done some chat RPGs in the past, too. You'll have to note that there's just a plethora of chat-style roleplaying out there. Some of it is a total free-for-all where anyone is allowed to post, others have defined rules, etc.  Over in the LJ world there's LOTS of blog-style chat roleplaying going on, and a lot of it has a standard format: Organizer posts a clear list of rules about the setting, the themes, the characters, etc. There are some loose rules about posting behavior and what is and isn't allowed, how members are expected to join, etc.<br/><br/>Check this out, here's an example of the rules/system concept (think of it as a "cover letter" for an online roleplaying activity) for most blog/LJ based roleplaying:<br/><a href="http://community.livejournal.com/rpers/" rel="nofollow">http://community.livejournal.com/rpers/</a> <b>EDIT: I think that everyone participating in this conversation <span style="text-decoration: underline;">needs</span> to go to this link, and explore 2-3 of the groups advertised.

But it's an enjoyable activity. Having said that, what does this mean for the OP's original questions? Let's maybe get over our hangups in looking for rules/system and just take for granted that they have or do not have them, based on your preferences. Getting over that, what does that say to the original questions posited?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite><b>So why do our games need rules, and theirs don't? Or put another way, what sort of rules do they need that we could provide? Or what sort of rules do we have that they just don't need? Or are we playing two different sorts of things, and if so why?</b></blockquote>\nIn order, here are my own personal answers:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite><br/>So why do our games need rules, and theirs don't?</blockquote>\nBecause we like to have rules, we enjoy the game-y aspects of it. They do not, and thus do not use rules. (and here by rules I mean, y'know, what we think of as rules in RPGs: Conflict resolution, mechanics, rolling, etc).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>what sort of rules do they need that we could provide?</blockquote>\nApparently none, because they're doing fine without us.<br/>There may be something that some members of their community might be able to lift/develop into their community, but it will have to involve "them" coming "here", finding something they like, then "taking it back to them".\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>what sort of rules do we have that they just don't need?</blockquote>\nApparently most of them, because again they're doing fine without us. Conflict resolution, "what happens next", etc is all a matter of convention, group and learned behavior (although some rp groups spell it out).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>Or are we playing two different sorts of things, and if so why?</blockquote>\nWe're playing two different sorts of things. Why? Because we just are.  HALO 3 and Settlers of Catan are two different activities, called "games", with their players calling themselves "gamers". There may be some Catan-ers who like HALO and vice-versa, but there's not really much to "bring to the table" in either community. Maybe on the development level there is some room for influence, ideas and the like. But they're two different activities.

You go round-robin, and there's probably other rules like how much you can edit someone else's contribution (which might be "you can't").  Improve theater has rules, jsut some of which are: never negate an offer; when you repond, include an offer; everything must be communicated through in-character dialog and action.<br/><br/>I've played in online chat where there was rules.  One common one was "combat can't occur unless both parties consent." And depending on whether or not there were rules for combat (like a couple of WoD MUSH's I played in) you also might have complete consent over what's done to your character (so even if you consent to combat, you also get to consent over whether their action to push your PC over a chair or behead your character happens).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123733/#Comment_123733" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-01T10:51:48+00:00" title="February  1, 2008 10:51AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite><cite>Posted By: renatoram</cite>The so called freeform on the one hand is much, much less enjoyable as a *game*</blockquote>\nCan you tell me what you mean by *game* in this context, because I'm not getting it.

"Our" games do not in fact need rules; it's not as if freeform play was invented with IRC and email. On the other hand, a text-based interface has several advantages. Text allows for firm reference and  clear basis for third party arbitration. In many cases, the social dynamic is character first, player second instead of a more front and center awareness of the person outside of their character. The large scale of many games also promotes community affiliation outside of the intervention of any moderator, though moderation should promote opportunities to get together.\n<blockquote><br/>Or put another way, what sort of rules do they need that we could provide?</blockquote>\nNone. Some systems and ideas could be imported for recreational value, but the fact is that we have more to learn from them than they have to learn from us. *They* are the cutting edge of roleplaying, not us. *They* are the grassroots future of the culture of gaming, not us. *They* are the people whose longwinded essays we should be reading, instead of calls to further subdivide an already minuscule hobby community.<br/><br/>I would say that quietly listening to what's going on with fanfic and chat games has significantly improved my work or White Wolf, because these guys exploit setting with rigorous pragmatism. Compare to tabletop discussion about "fixing" X or Y and massive prep and brainstorming for games that will probably never happen. <i>Adamantine Arrow</i> for Mage has a local group construction guide that is a direct result of this influence. Both it and an upcomin book feature in-setting events that were written in reaction to how online, setting-focused games want robust story events. Some of those elements are *not* appropriate for tabletop play (such as the  levelling of story importance for all PCs to give everybody a chance to interact with equally important things.\n<blockquote>Or what sort of rules do we have that they just don't need?</blockquote>\nRoleplaying is not an activity based on firmly defined procedural "needs." It's an art of preferences.\n<blockquote><br/>Or are we playing two different sorts of things, and if so why?</blockquote>\nThey're different media. There are obvious commonalities and they fall in the general locus of roleplaying. If roleplaying is (as is commonly claimed) a fundamental human activity, it should be no surprise that it expresses itself across multiple media -- but each medium influences the activity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123762/#Comment_123762" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-01T12:12:26+00:00" title="February  1, 2008 12:12PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think we are sidetracking in too abstract stuff, too. <br/><br/>To get back to the original question by hituro:\n<blockquote>So why do our games need rules, and theirs don't?

I agree that players in a "tavern" freeform are quite content just to talk to other characters, talking about themselves and to each other. They find that rewarding, obviously <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> So why in a tabletop RPG don't most people want to do the same? You are quite right that most tabletop RPGs that visit a tavern are just there for a brief period, as a stop off to an adventure. I am curious as to whether that different is just because the players are very different people, or because the medium / system involved favours one sort of play over another.<br/><br/>i.e. would freeform online tavern players be killing monsters in a cave (like they do on WoW) if only they could do that on their forum (i.e. if they had the tools), or are those players simply people who don't want to do that? (My experience says they are not, since lots of such boards are connected to live action games where people certainly do go off and kill monsters).  If not, and they are the same sort of people as tabletop players, then why don't we spend our gaming sessions chatting to people in inns for its own sake?<br/><br/>I can think of a number of reasons. One, I am sure, is to do with the medium and the people involved. People do not just go on these forums to RP, they go to talk with people online, and because of that they are happy to just talk, it's part of the point. <br/><br/>Another reason is time. I often see people here complain about having little time to RP (and I have similar problems myself), so we want to pack that time with action. People online, conversely, have plenty of time and  therefore less pull towards action?<br/><br/>And a final reason is numbers. You don't chat to all the random characters in the tavern on a tabletop, because they are (in most games) all the GM. Online they are all actually people, and therefore more worth talking too.<br/><br/>Of course I could be talking rubbish <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

In Mage, orders have local organizations called caucuses. Since Awakened society is quite balkanized, two caucuses in different cities can have vastly different traditions.<br/><br/>Online games need well-defined guidelines for these groups, because the luxury of a GM giving a briefing on local affairs isn't there. Players come with expectations about who they're joining up with, and GMs need to be able to exercise creativity within that structure, but in such a way that the end result runs itself. This is also handy for tabletop groups because these requirements can help them and won't hinder them, because they're entirely in-world situations with no hard rules.<br/><br/>Thus book puts the huge set of options into a general structure based on caucus age, political stance and other factors. In an online game, Storytellers can lay these out explicitly in the text. In a tabletop game, these serve as excellent reference points to get the ST thinking, but they do not force any particular situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123819/#Comment_123819" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-01T14:21:41+00:00" title="February  1, 2008  2:21PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 1, 2008 2:28PM by Wolfe.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One assumption I see here is that there are certain types of play that freeform cannot handle, which I think is a bad assumption. The types mentioned in one post above include dungeon delving, monster fighting and mysteries. All of these happened with some level of frequency in my old community. The trick is that the players can and are encouraged to play outside their PC. Often, one player would request another player to "play an NPC" for them. In those circumstances, the player playing the NPC had only to stick with the specific requests of the other player, and anything already established about that NPC. At least one of my regular characters was born of a throwaway NPC played for someone else, because the NPC ended up being engaging to me and others. This concept can be extended to monsters and dungeon delving. <br/><br/>In one notable case in which I took part, three PCs were searching for an object of power in an abandoned tower. We would take turns introducing adversity which all three of our characters would overcome. There exists some potential for aggrandizement of your own PC, but when depth of character and play was more important than badassery (which was basically the rule when badassery was entirely based on your own desires and whims), the majority of effort was put forth into making the encounters interesting for your fellow players. So there, we had both dungeon delving and monster fighting. Additionally, much of the thrill of the unknown was also intact, because we didn't know what would be introduced next by each other, nor did we necessarily know how their introductions would inspire our own future introductions. <br/><br/>Mystery is a little bit more difficult, but is still doable with the idea of "authority" players. In the community, there were many sub-divisions of setting, based on geographical region and organizations. Each major subsection had a "head", both within the fiction and without. Usually, the head player also played the head character, though there were a few exceptions to the rule. For example, I was the head of the main military force for a while before the community founder passed the General to me to play. But I'm digressing. Mystery can be introduced by these players. In the above example, we didn't exactly know what we'd find in the tower, nor did we know what it did. The setting-wide storyline coordinator told us what it was late into our play of the dungeon, and we played and wrote the story of how we acquired it.. Then the coordinator added the effects of finding it.. And the entire mystery came together at a massive play session that involved the historical bad guy of the setting being reborn through the unknowing efforts of characters of good intent or ill. <br/><br/>Now, whether or not this can be considered a game, I don't know. We never called it a game, though we did refer to "playing" it. Whatever it was, it had rules, many of which I've seen reflected more or less explicitly in tabletop roleplaying games.<br/><br/>crossposted with a few different people, edited to address some of Hituro's points: <br/><br/>I think my example demonstrates that freeform can include action/adventure play. The community I was part of was a tavern roleplay community, but it went out beyond the tavern pretty regularly. Usually this was in small storylines involving only a few people, but community "events" happen periodically which allow all players to participate in setting changing events. It was also not uncommon (somewhat unrealistic, but not uncommon) for battles to take place in the immediate environs of the tavern. <br/><br/>conversely, I've played with groups that will spend sessions in a row without any action, doing things equivalent to talking to people in a tavern. For the most part I enjoy this sort of play as well, though I do confess to getting a little agitated if it continues for too many sessions; I do like my action, too. I may be atypical. I may also be influenced by my years as an active member of the above community. But it's a data point, nonetheless.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123821/#Comment_123821" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-01T14:29:17+00:00" title="February  1, 2008  2:29PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

I don't know what the Lumpley Principle is. Seriously. I keep forgetting all this stuff.<br/><br/>(goes to look it up):<br/><br/>"System (including but not limited to 'the rules') is defined as the means by which the group agrees to imagined events during play." <br/><br/>...<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>So, I'm thinking that the discussion happening at the top of the thread, "Doesn't it use rules? Doesn't it use system?" etc might be, well, agreed upon if everyone bought into that principle.  I plainly do buy into it, and I said as much above. <br/><br/>Problem is, saying, "Yep, there's System in there. Be it in an opening moderator post, or a series of conventions that everyone internally adopts that linger from rp community to community, there's some overarching framework to which the group agrees to facilitate themselves!" ... ...  that doesn't really seem to take us any further down the path of the original poster's question, which was:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite><br/>So why do our games need rules, and theirs don't? Or put another way, what sort of rules do they need that we could provide? Or what sort of rules do we have that they just don't need? Or are we playing two different sorts of things, and if so why?</blockquote>\nI don't see how saying "Those groups sure are using systems in the end" helps us move forward with finding common ground between the communities, be it to pull things from online roleplay into our tabletop games, or to somehow push our tabletop roleplaying rules onto online roleplay.<br/><br/>...unless I'm missing something?<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123890/#Comment_123890" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-01T22:55:35+00:00" title="February  1, 2008 10:55PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>I know!

I went to a dinner at the college dean's house. The Japanese dudes see all these plates, and these big bowls of mashed potatoes, corn, green beans, turkey etc and look really kinda nervous. After chatting with each other for a sec, they asked me and the Japanese teacher at my school, "What are the traditional rules of getting food from the bowls?" We were stymied for a bit trying to explain that there are really no rules per se, when another teacher jumped in and said (just invented this shit), "Oh, BIG bowls go Clockwise, LITTLE bowls go Counter-Clockwise". All of the Japanese folks looked REALLY relieved to see that there were rules for this behavior, and started moving the bowls around the table, serving themselves from them comfortably, etc.<br/><br/>It's a good metaphor for what I'm seeing here and there in this thread.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123949/#Comment_123949" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-02T11:42:15+00:00" title="February  2, 2008 11:42AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy, <br/><br/>That is my new favorite story about Japan, having replaced The Tale of the Heike.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123950/#Comment_123950" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-02T11:45:30+00:00" title="February  2, 2008 11:45AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I love that story.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Astinus" title="Astinus"><img alt="Astinus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Astinus">Astinus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123989/#Comment_123989" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-02T16:06:20+00:00" title="February  2, 2008  4:06PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just managed to lose a huge post...<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, basically I was going to say that our games need rules because we like the excitement they can provide by taking certain things (like combat) out of out hands.
