For example: I am Graham, playing a character called Gerry The Lock. We do this especially in game texts: rather than saying "When you attack someone", we tend to say "When your character attacks someone". <br/><br/>I think it's a confusing distinction.<br/><br/>Most people, outside of roleplaying, implicitly get the idea that you <i>are</i> your character. In the school playground, we both understand that I <i>am</i> the Doctor and you <i>are</i> a Dalek. There's no need to say that I am Graham, playing the Doctor and you are Bill, playing a Dalek. We automatically get it. If I say "You shot me!", we both understand exactly what's happening.<br/><br/>Equally, we automatically get the limits to the idea. If I want to attack you, as the Dalek, I don't actually attack you. We both understand the limits. We rarely need a player/character distinction. <br/><br/>Even at the gaming table, we don't speak in terms of players and characters. If I say "I attack you", everyone knows what I mean. Everyone totally gets that, during the game, you are the character.<br/><br/>So I wonder what the player/character distinction does for us? I wonder if it does more harm than good.<br/><br/>Specifically, I think it does harm in two ways. Firstly, by not matching the language we use at the gaming table, it makes game texts more complicated. Everyone knows what "Lord Blackguard attacks Lightfoot" means. They don't need to hear "Graham, playing Lord Blackguard, attacks Bill, playing Lightfoot".<br/><br/>Secondly, I think it robs us of the mysticism of becoming the character. Playacting is a very primal thing. By insisting that the player and character are different, we lose a lot.<br/><br/>So there you go. Hey, can you post slowly and thoughtfully? No quickfire one-liners, please. Thanks!<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227488/#Comment_227488" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T06:58:23+00:00" title="August 25, 2009  6:58AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2009 7:57AM by Thunder_God.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think part of the strength of role-playing is that at the same time we are and aren't our characters.<br/><br/>We live on the divide.

Structuralism points to things that cross and muddy the lines.<br/><br/>Edit: It is the distinction and lack of it at the same time that enables RPGs to affect us in the manner that they do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227490/#Comment_227490" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T07:10:43+00:00" title="August 25, 2009  7:10AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2009 7:11AM by Joe_Beason.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree that playtexts can get too complicated when both the characters' and the players' names are being used.  "Wait, which character was Sue playing?"  <br/><br/>There's a couple good reasons for saying "Lord Bunny does X" rather than "I do X" at the table.  Given that in most games there's at least one player speaking for multiple characters, saying "Lord Bunny does X" will sometimes be necessary.  Second, if there's a lot of table talk, "I don't think that's a good idea" means something very different from "Lord Bunny doesn't think that's a good idea."

Even your examples distinguish between the way gamers talk at the table and the way that game designers write game-texts. I'd assert that the careful distinction between player and character that occurs in game-texts originated as a defensive response to the moral panic over D&amp;D in the United States in the 70s and 80s, part of which took the form of fears that players would confuse the game with real life and start swinging swords in public or running around in steam tunnels. So game designers started inserting warnings to the effect that "You are not your character, you psycho." Having emerged, the practice continues; interestingly, it becomes available as a resource for game designers to mess with: see Paul Tevis's <i>A Penny for My Thoughts</i>, where much of the game text is written as if to the character, not the player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227507/#Comment_227507" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T07:59:34+00:00" title="August 25, 2009  7:59AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm trying to strike a balance in my examples of play by using pictures of the example players along with their table chatter. Hopefully that negates the need to explicitly say "Graham, playing Lord Blackguard, attacks Bill, playing Lightfoot" when you can just have a picture of Graham and Bill.<br/><br/>Otherwise, I think I'm in the minority around here in that I am very consciously <i>not</i> my character. I get kinda fidgety if I have to role-play a bunch. (I think Remi mentioned this at Dreamation actually.) I do refer to my characters in the third-person more often than not, even at the table. "Immersion" makes me uncomfortable.<br/><br/>I think I do this because I don't like the social barrier of an alternate persona separating me from the other players at the table. I like hanging out with the players and seeing how we play together, y'know?<br/><br/>So yeah, I'm going to keep explicitly and consistently distinguishing between player and character in my game texts or, even better, make games that don't assume exclusive character ownership.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227508/#Comment_227508" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T08:00:31+00:00" title="August 25, 2009  8:00AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2009 8:01AM by jenskot.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>Hey Graham -- I think you're mistaken when you say that "Gamers<i>like</i>to distinguish players and characters."

My bad. I tender as a lame excuse that I am dizzy after getting back from a four-day cruise. I know you feel sorry for me, right?<br/><br/>No? Okay, on to your latest post.<br/><br/>I think we're in agreement. But I beg the question: do gamers actually distinguish that much between player and character during play? The GM says "what do you do?" and the player says "I stab him in the face." Everyone knows what everyone else means. <br/><br/>The player/character distinction exists at the table but isn't really discussed much. It's not that useful there. It's useful in the text though, especially in examples. I don't know how to talk about this subject without coming back to the text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227653/#Comment_227653" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T14:30:06+00:00" title="August 25, 2009  2:30PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Every player of every roleplaying game ever acknowledges a separation between himself and the character. The events of the game may be engaging and immersive, but as soon as you grab dice or a pencil, you're saying -- consciously or not -- "I will now operate this mechanic in order to have an effect on the events at hand. One moment please. Ah yes. There is my result. I shall resume close identification with my character....now."<br/><br/>The game itself presents a "barrier" between the kind of performance present in improv. The game itself must acknowledge the separation in order to justify all of the cool things the character is doing in the fiction, as opposed to the mundane things we are doing sitting around the table.<br/><br/>It's a complex relationship, rapidly shifting states in play, but I think there are distinctions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
