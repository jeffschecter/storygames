Each Countdown is a turn. Here is a simple summary of how it works:<br/><br/>With each tick of the Countdown, every player except the Director gets a scene for his or her character. Players use the rules to decide the order of each player\xe2\u20ac\u2122s scene.<br/>During your scene, you portray your main character\xe2\u20ac\u2122s actions and hear the Director\xe2\u20ac\u2122s reactions against them. Each scene, you will eventually confront the Director in some kind of conflict. Sometimes, other players\xe2\u20ac\u2122 main characters will get to help you. To resolve the event, you\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll use the rules and roll dice. The Director will do the same. The dice will determine the winner of the conflict. Then, you and your fellow players will narrate what happens in the story as a result.<br/>Sometimes, your main character will lose terribly. He or she will be replaced by a machine from Section 44 and become an Operative. Then, you will play the machine, plotting against your fellow players who still have main characters that are not replaced. When this happens, you still get a scene during each Countdown like other players do. However, in these cases you roll against main characters rather than against The Director.<br/>Once all players have completed their turns, players with main characters roll some communal dice against Control and his Operatives, who have some shared dice as well. The winning group receives a reward, and players narrate events explaining the win\xe2\u20ac\u2122s effect on the conspiracy.<br/>You reduce the Countdown by 1 and begin the process again.<br/>Once the countdown reaches 0, the game is over. You do not proceed through the above cycle for the Zero Hour. Instead, compare your main character\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Quality ratings to Director\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Control rating to determine your main character\xe2\u20ac\u2122s fate, grim or triumphant. There are several details and specific rules, but this explains the overall game.</blockquote>\n<a href="http://www.chimera.info/wp-content/uploads/44-sample.pdf" rel="nofollow">Check out a 2-page sample of this text in the 44 layout.</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.chimera.info/wp-content/uploads/44-character-record.pdf" rel="nofollow">And, preview the character record.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86132/#Comment_86132" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-07T10:53:34+00:00" title="August  7, 2007 10:53AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt, how baked is 44?

I've played it. It's fun.<br/><br/>I ask a bunch of questions in the game text's margins. Most of these comments are kind of response marketing. "Here's this thing I did. It works. So, what do YOU think about it?" Etc. <br/><br/>But, the one piece that abosolutely needs testing is Replacement. This is the main thing I seek commentary on, without a doubt. <br/><br/>Replacement is the point at which players lose their human main character and become a robot, one of the bad guys. They still get a scene each turn, but they have to pick one of the other main characters to go after. During their scene, the GM sits out.  So, they're sorta-kinda like mini-GMs, and they share GM resources as well. But, they have their own autonomy. <br/><br/>I like what I've come up with for this, but the testing is very slight. Basically, in the second-to-last playtest we "ret-conned" a scene to see how it would go, and that's about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86148/#Comment_86148" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-07T11:45:47+00:00" title="August  7, 2007 11:45AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, thanks, it sounds like it is well beyond what we'd consider an in-playtest game then.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86178/#Comment_86178" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-07T12:36:42+00:00" title="August  7, 2007 12:36PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like those deep margins on the page sides for notes.

I don't know yet what format the final version of the game will take. But, I agree! I dig these margins, too.<br/><br/>Here's a very, very brief run down of the game's mechanics: <br/><br/>So, you have three Qualities. They are Resolve, Contact, and Material. You pick one when you enter a conflict. The number is how many dice you start with. Next, you can add Bonds to the scene. Bonds are your friends -- people you can count on. They have a numerical value. They add more dice to your roll equal to that value. <br/><br/>Finally, you have Anxieties. These are like Muses (Nine Worlds) or Keys (TSoY) turned on their head. They are fears you invoke.  They penalize your dice results. But, sometimes you get to save penalized dice. And, if you win, the penalized dice go into a shared pool of dice (sorta like a Gift Dice pool). <br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Director is rolling against you. He has a Control rating that sets the number of dice he rolls every time. He also has Agents, which are like bad guy Bonds (they add more dice to his roll). And finally he has Secrets, which work just like Anxieties for the bad guys, Section 44. <br/><br/>You and the Director roll for your conflict in your scene. You use the highest die value you can. Remember those penalties? They make you remove the higest results first. Whatever is left is your result. You have to beat the Director. If you tie or roll less, you lose the conflict.<br/><br/>The winner puts a number of dice into his communal pool equal to his penalties. Again, those are like Gift Dice or fan mail for later.<br/><br/>The loser suffers Stress equal to the difference between each person's die results. Stress first nails Bonds/Agents. Bonds that get nailed become Agents. Agents that get nailed are removed from the game.<br/><br/>Finally, both participants can save "Reserve" dice. I'm told this is sorta like the River in Weapon of the Gods. The Reserve is your stash of dice. You keep the results (remember, they're high rolls!) for future rolls, to buy new Bonds, improve your scores, or share with pals. You generally have 1-3 of these babies sitting around.<br/><br/>That's the mechanical bits. There's more, of course.<br/><br/>First, there's a game timer, the Countdown that determines the game length. But, it also sets the limit at which your fellow main characters can enter your scenes to help you out. There's also a big group vs. the Director (and his lackeys, if any) roll at the end of each round. It's sort of like a big "The story so far" roll that gives the winners either a new Anxiety or a new Secret.<br/><br/>Finally, there's a simple end game when the Countdown hits zero. You just compare yoru scores to the Director, and that informs whether your ending is happy survival, mixed on-the-run paranoia, or being replaced with a machine after all.<br/><br/>Fun, creepy stuff!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.
