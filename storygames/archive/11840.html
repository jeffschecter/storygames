After settling in we spent a little time hanging out with Matt and Shannon, the couple who do the Seattle Geekly podcast, then we broke ranks and Leslie and I played a fantastically stabbity game of In A Wicked Age. After that I socialized and then went to the indie publishing panel which started slow, but ended up engaging and fun. After more socializing and wandering about I went to a nice brewpub with Harper and we had some nice beer and food. I got back and jumped into a game of Hot Guys Making Out with Mickey, and Pol and Karin Jackson which Karin described as "smut chicken." Who blinks first? All I can say is that white wax dripping down a candlestick was excellent color to the action taking place. Then drinks with Harper and Carl Rigney.<br/>\nI spent the next day mostly socializing at the indie hurricaine booth and eating great food from the farmer's market out front. I went to the game design panel and that was a good time.<br/>\nIt was awesome to see the crew, who mostly live too close for me only to see a few times a year, to meet a few new folks (hi, Brian, Tiffany, Vincent, Twylla) and to just chill.<br/>\nOh, and I bought a copy of Heroe's Banner.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264344/#Comment_264344" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-29T09:26:41+00:00" title="March 29, 2010  9:26AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 29, 2010 9:27AM by Hans_c-o.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, this is crazy, but I think I had just as much or more fun at Gamestorm as I did at GoPlayNW.<br><br>--John Harper ran a wicked fun game of Apocalypse World (with 6 players!

Then dinner and hanging out with Pol and Karin Jackson, who are awesome. Then a completely kickass game of Montsiegur1244. So boss.

At 1am on Saturday morning (after my amazing AW game with Jackson, Joe, Johnzo, and Brendan), Vincent looks blearily over at Carl, Twyla, and me and says, "I either need sleep or beer." I have never before seen a beer ninja'd into someone's hand so fast and smoothly (nice move, Twyla). 6am came around in a blink.<br/><br/>I only got to watch a little of the <b>Montsegur 1244</b> game, but damn. There was magic radiating off of that game like heat from a bonfire.<br/><br/><b>Danger Patrol: AXE COP</b> is the most right idea ever. Brendan's mad genius cred is now unassailable. Hmmm. Actually, Carl Rigney is a true contender. A mad genius deathmatch inside a volcano is now our only option.<br/><br/>This con was the perfect blend of great gaming and wonderful, chill, hang outs. It's what I always want from GenCon but it's much harder to arrange there. The climactic embrace at the end of Sunday's <b>Sea Dracula</b> game (with swelling music provided by the <i>live band</i>) perfectly captured the emotional high I was on at that moment.<br/><br/>I will definitely be back next year.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264406/#Comment_264406" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-29T15:19:16+00:00" title="March 29, 2010  3:19PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My most casual con experience ever: i signed up for nothing.<br/>I played a little less than i would have liked (though Carl pointed out that even if i'd have gamed for 72 hours straight it wouldn't have FELT like enough), but those games were wonderful &amp; memorable.<br/><br/>thanks, everyone.

I <a href="http://storybythethroat.wordpress.com/2010/03/31/tragic-trajectories/" rel="nofollow">wrote about it here</a>.<br/><br/><b>Apocalypse World with Vincent:</b> also so good. The Firefly vibe was going strong. I wrote about it in the same place.<br/><br/><b>Heart of Ashes with Joe:</b> wow. A solid game that brings the children growing up ad coping with a dangerous world thing, HARD. My asthmatic tagalong was shunned by the other kids and adopted by Ratboys.<br/><br/><b><a href="http://whereareyourkeys.org/" rel="nofollow">Where Are Your Keys?</a> with Willem:</b> I had a lot of fun playing this learning game with Nick, Jim and others, and discussing where these fun concepts can take us in designing games and teaching games.<br/><br/><b>Rebellion in the Mushroom Kingdom! in Solar System:</b> Total double-plus fun. We had a sad and browbeaten Mario, a self-absorbed and scheming Princess, an incorrigible, sleazy Kamek and a clueless Bowser who wooed through carnage.<br/><br/><a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product_info.php?products_id=63117&amp;filters=0_0_0_0_0&amp;manufacturers_id=385" rel="nofollow"><b>Spectre of the Beast:</b></a> a great playtest with Tyler and Johno from the Eugene Storyjam crew. Urbanites, highlanders and gypsies culturally mixing to disastrous effect.<br/><br/><b>My Life With Master:</b> I got to be a Cardinal driven to purify the sins out of his parish. I burned sinning hands with coal, jabbed needles through flirting tongues...and got hurled through a stained glass window! (A fun side phenomenon in that game: my friends Mark and Kam played it, along with their teenage (?) son. Yay for gaming across the generation gap!)<br/><br/><b>The Dreaming Crucible:</b> My new game about going into Faerie to work out your adolescent pain was a hit! I didn't have it scheduled, since I didn't know if it would be ready to play. But I sold a bunch of copies, it demoed well, and saw other folks playing it in the lobby of their own volition! I was so pleased.<br/><br/><b>Sea Dracula:</b> It wouldn't be Gamestorm without some awkward crossing of personal boundaries and rectum-themed dancing! I was happy to humiliate myself for the cause.<br/><br/>You may notice that this looks suspiciously like every game I played--it is! That was how fun the con was for me; every event was a "highlight."<br/><br/>Thanks, everyone!<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265058/#Comment_265058" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-01T21:25:29+00:00" title="April  1, 2010  9:25PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>Joel's annual "and now I take a classic media property and subvert it" game (using The Solar System)</blockquote>\nNext year: <i>Emo Hobbits.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265064/#Comment_265064" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-01T21:47:12+00:00" title="April  1, 2010  9:47PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joel</cite>My asthmatic tagalong was shunned by the other kids and adopted by Ratboys.</blockquote>\n...through break-ins, attempted arson and sleeping in a nest... you were reborn!

Mine was called "How Do You Make The Heart Do Tricks?", and was listless indie music.<br/>Stefano's was mostly rap, in the "welcome to the big city, ain't it shine so bright?!" tradition (Jay-Z, Kanye, etc).<br/><br/>We encountered the CDs in that order. We never got to Jackson's.<br/><br/>We got "A Country Boy Will Survive" as our first song.<br/>So, we're settle upon playing folk leaving a small town that just got a Walmart:<br/>Lars, a hunter and butcher, who feels that the town is no longer "real", and that he needs to find somewhere real and then bring his wife Janet down to the new place<br/>Kyle, a violent teen, who feels like he's been betrayed by those around him, and needs to leave town<br/>Grace, his step-mom, who's hit with wanderlust and a sense of quiet desperation, and takes to the road under the pretense of keeping Kyle safe<br/>DJ Donald Duck, a black rapper from NYC who's under witness protection, but who wants to escape WP*<br/><br/>Lars = me, Kyle = Peter, Grace = Jackson, DJ = Stefano<br/><br/>*This was Stefano's character. He wasn't really on the same page as us, in terms of what we were trying to do with the game. We just rolled with it.<br/><br/>The game opens with Grace telling Kyle's dad that they're leaving, and that the pumps have gone dry (they owned a gas station).<br/>I got to play the husband/dad for that scene, and played him like he'd just been waiting for that hammer to fall for months.<br/>So, the four of us head out!<br/>And it gets ugly quickly: Lars calls Janet and explains that he's gone out huntin' for a new place to call home, and Janet threatens divorce unless he comes home ASAP.<br/>We all stop at a biker bar, where Kyle loses everything in a pool game, and then starts a furious bar fight that we totally thrash the bikers in.<br/>People may have died. I definitely threw a cue ball at the bartender's face.<br/>We settle down in a parking lot for the night, and Kyle kisses his stepmom, tells her "shut up" when she almost objects, and then pulls her close and cuddles her.<br/>Awkwardness the next day!<br/>Many futures get crossed off!<br/>I'll skip ahead to the good stuff...<br/>As Kyle gets carted off in a police car, Grace realizes that she'll never return to her husband, and she'll never keep Kyle safe.<br/>I walk back out from the convenience store at this point, and say "Alright. Ready to make it the rest of the way to Bourbon, Tennessee?"<br/>She nods.<br/>She smiles.<br/>I jump in the passenger seat, circling my last Future as she crosses off the last of hers.<br/>We ride into the sunset, with DJ Donald Duck in the back seat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
