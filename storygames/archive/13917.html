I was really impressed by how easy the setting was to learn.<br/><br/>For example. I learn, at the beginning of the game, that tyrannids are coming towards the planet. Now, I have no idea what tyrannids are. But it's clear, from the name, that they're bad. They are going to come towards the planet and do bad things. Easy.<br/><br/>I also hear about people called psykers. Well, I know what they are. They're psychics. <br/><br/>Then, there is a cult of genesplicers. Just from the name, I know pretty much what they do. <br/><br/>And the whole system was like that. Wonderfully rich and detailed, but fabulously easy to learn. Partly, it was because it used well-known reference points (psychics, Inquisitors); partly, it was the cleverly-chosen names (tyrannids, genesplicers). So simple, but really useful.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315384/#Comment_315384" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-03T18:29:01+00:00" title="March  3, 2011  6:29PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah!<br/><br/>The other thing that the Warhammer 40k setting has going for it is that it's entirely unabashed and unashamed of what it is. Things become part of the 40k universe if they pass the awesome metric, not the profound or the clever or the innovative metric. There's no forced nuance to anything.<br/><br/>And the benefit of that is that when I want to play awesome lesbian sex mutants, I get to play awesome lesbian sex mutants. When I want to play elves in space, it's simple: do you want to play goodguy elves, or badguy elves? No lame-o is asking me to jump through hoops in order to do something awesome. Every faction is its most badass self. Everything is gleefully, unnecessarily cool. No one pissed on anyone else's parade during the creative process.<br/><br/>What joy!<br/><br/>This ties in nicely with Graham's thing about intuitiveness, also.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315401/#Comment_315401" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-03T20:06:28+00:00" title="March  3, 2011  8:06PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree completely.

No way. There are no good guys here, and for a change, there really aren't!<br/>I don't know other settings that feel so suffocatingly dark, not even the fantasy version. And it's <b>gothic</b>. Not in the emo dark goth garbage you see around. This is the real, dark ages gothic awesomeness.<br/>Dang, Graham.

As Joe puts it: "Everything is gleefully, unnecessarily cool." Also: everyone is EVIL + HORRIBLE, for reals. &amp;c.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that the second you try and think about any of the setting colour, it falls apart. "Why the hell is command authority about the size and complexity of one's hat?" or "Wait, why are these space orcs dressed as pirates and talk like British football hooligans?" or "So, the battle plan is to wade into the artillery fire with these chain-saws and hope the Emperor is smiling on us?"<br/><br/>Not to ruin anyone's fun but it requires a constant suspension of disbelief that can't really be scrutinized. Which is fine, so long as it never comes up in a serious way. The problem for me, at least, is that I'm not sure how long I could maintain as either the player or the GM, before nuance started to be a real necessity. Don't get me wrong: I love the setting as much as the rest of you guys. I've just always been apprehensive about role-playing in it.<br/><br/>But yeah - sometimes our settings just need to go big or go home.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315495/#Comment_315495" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-04T14:37:48+00:00" title="March  4, 2011  2:37PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roger</cite>But there's also non-obvious things.

I do agree that I can't read most of the novels (except ones written by Abbot) because of this very thing. Reading combat scenes is a little ridiculous, although playing them out in whatever medium (boardgame, miniatures game, roleplaying game) never bothers me because I just assume that's part of the role--they really CAN wade through artillery fire with chainsaws. As long as my brain is in charge of generating the fictional color, it doesn't strike me as strange.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315504/#Comment_315504" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-04T15:32:52+00:00" title="March  4, 2011  3:32PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd use a chainsaw too if the range of my bolter rifle was appreciably less than a good punt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristansaurus-Rex" title="Tristansaurus-Rex"><img alt="Tristansaurus-Rex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristansaurus-Rex">Tristansaurus-Rex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315509/#Comment_315509" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-04T16:00:37+00:00" title="March  4, 2011  4:00PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure that the issue is with the setting. My reason for this is that there is no more or less suspension of disbelief required by the setting of WH40K than by any other science fiction setting. I think that it is, for my part at least, more about putting things together in a way that makes sense. This I think is illustrated excellently in the question posed by Orly earlier.<br/>\n<br/>\n"Why the hell is command authority about the size and complexity of one's hat?"<br/>\n<br/>\nThis detail (hat style being related to authority) can seem extremely odd, not to mention comical, when taken out of context. But then again so it the concept that in the universe put forward by Star Wars, that mystical psychic knights run about with what appear to be a form of plasma sword, that only they have. If instead of focusing on the disconnects within the logic of the setting, we sink ourselves into our character, take a few things at face value: even if all you can do is shrug and give it the old "It's that way because we done it that way as long as anyone remembers."<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my opinion, the setting for WH40K allows players to pose a variety of questions about purity, corruption, authority, and monolithic organizations which other settings may not have room for, simply because there are not shades of grey which exist in other games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315511/#Comment_315511" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-04T16:04:15+00:00" title="March  4, 2011  4:04PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tristansaurus-Rex</cite>In my opinion, the setting for WH40K allows players to pose a variety of questions about purity, corruption, authority, and monolithic organizations which other settings may not have room for, simply because there are not shades of grey which exist in other games.</blockquote>\nThat sounds like heresy talk to me.

The original game and source material the current game still has in its DNA is full of puns, inside jokes, and cultural references. Also, in British wargame rules there is indeed a spirit of fun and humor that gets injected into the games from time to time, even in the very serious historical ones.<br/><br/>The modern version of the game has made a great effort to scour itself clean of the original game's oddities, but a lot of it is still there.<br/><br/>That's what I like about the 40K setting. You look at it one way and it can be a relentless grimdark glorious killfest, then tip your head the other way and you realize just how crazy it is and you can't help but laugh at the gretchin cackling in the corner at the Space Marine getting all full of himself before he blows his save and gets his head shot off. <br/><br/>So you can play it either way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315827/#Comment_315827" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-08T02:01:00+00:00" title="March  8, 2011  2:01AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find 3:16 entirely captures the spirit of 40K, certainly the way we play it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper" title="Ian Cooper"><img alt="Ian Cooper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/733/nRK18K7505XHK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper">Ian Cooper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316391/#Comment_316391" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-12T11:47:37+00:00" title="March 12, 2011 11:47AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WH40K is very influenced (for obvious reasons) by Brit comics such as 2000AD which gave most of us a regular diet of dystopian right-wing futures. The most famous of these is of course <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judge_Dredd" rel="nofollow">Judge Dredd</a>, and the influence of that comic permeate the setting. The comics projected these dystopian vision in a strongly satirical style; Judge Dredd is an anti-hero, an expression of the authoritarian, paternalistic, fascist state. That he's also in many cases a 'good' man is part of the blurring, and shades of gray common to 2000AD. The comics were also riddled with gags and jokes that mocked contemporary culture (as much of the best SF does). So as a mix it makes enormous sense to Brit SF fans, but is in a sense now its own genre style.<br/><br/>So you are supposed to see it as satirical and humorous but also as dark and dystopian. The best way to achieve this is, IMO, to play with a heavy sense of dramatic irony about your actions as a fascist secret policeman or stormtrooper.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_316393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316393/#Comment_316393" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-12T12:02:49+00:00" title="March 12, 2011 12:02PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Partly, it was because it used well-known reference points (psychics, Inquisitors); partly, it was the cleverly-chosen names (tyrannids, genesplicers).

The original game and source material the current game still has in its DNA is full of puns, inside jokes, and cultural references. Also, in British wargame rules there is indeed a spirit of fun and humor that gets injected into the games from time to time, even in the very serious historical ones.<br/><br/>The modern version of the game has made a great effort to scour itself clean of the original game's oddities, but a lot of it is still there.<br/></blockquote>\nThis is the big problem that I have with the setting. The Dreddness of it has dissippated. Since I got my copy of Rogue Trader it seems to have lost its sense of irony. Now it's racist and religious fanatics trying to scour the universe of sub-humans who are, after all, trying to destroy humanity. It's patently and grotesquely the thing that it used to be a mockery of.<br/><br/>Graham, has it occurred to you that the setting is easy to learn because it's an artifact of exactly your English culture? There's nothing inherently alluring or comprehensible about it except the parts where they're knocking off other SF or just being English.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi" title="Kobayashi"><img alt="Kobayashi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://zadkin.free.fr/logoBaveuse2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi">Kobayashi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316602/#Comment_316602" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-14T15:28:11+00:00" title="March 14, 2011  3:28PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm running a <b>Dark Heresy</b> game using <b>Lamentations of the Flame Princess</b>.
