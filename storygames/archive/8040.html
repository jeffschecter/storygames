While most roleplaying games require you to participate religiously, as if you were a hardcore fan of a TV show, there is definitely room for games that are more like boardgames or DVDs, requiring a few hours of your time and no ongoing commitment. The challenge there, as it has been with Geiger Counter, is being able to get everyone on something-sorta-resembling the same page and create a really great play experience with as little planning, prep, and background knowledge as possible.  We're getting better at helping people do that, I think.<br/><br/>Another option is the In A Wicked Age, loose anthology style, where things can vary a lot between sessions and still maintain a loose continuity.  I haven't done as much of that, so I'm not sure I have a lot to say in that regard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177387/#Comment_177387" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-05T09:15:35+00:00" title="November  5, 2008  9:15AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan can you give us an example response to kick us off? <br/><br/>For me, D&amp;D 4E is usually the game we play when we want to answer no to many of these questions. Mainly because the GM handles so much of the prep and that since the game is heavily encounter based, it's generally not a big deal if different characters and players are available session to session. In our Thursday game, we have a character that can be played by guests stopping by for a session or two. And when everyone can't make it, we will often play 2 characters to round out the group. The player size varies from 4-6 on a regular basis. <br/><br/>If we were playing PTA, I don't think I would ever have another player play someone's character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177391/#Comment_177391" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-05T09:38:16+00:00" title="November  5, 2008  9:38AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Another option is the In A Wicked Age, loose anthology style, where things can vary a lot between sessions and still maintain a loose continuity.

It ran really well, and went like this:<br/><br/>* We had a membership of about a dozen people. Their names were ordered into a list.<br/>* There was a game every Saturday afternoon.<br/>* Each member committed to a particular Saturday, when they would run a game--a one-shot. When you signed up, you would pick your Saturday.<br/>* Each Sunday, whoever was the next GM would send an e-mail to the next X people on the list, where X is the number of players he or she needed for the game.<br/>* If some of those people couldn't make it or didn't reply, on Thursday the GM would send out a general invitation to everyone on the list. Whoever replied first would fill in the missing spot or spots.<br/>* After the game, the GM would e-mail the next GM, telling them where they had "left off" on the list.<br/>* The next GM would send out their invitation, starting from wherever the previous GM had left off.<br/><br/>This worked really, really well 95% of the time. Of course, there were instances where a GM was sick or had to cancel, but it was very rare that a GM couldn't get enough people for his or her game. If you were really gung-ho, you could play almost every week, since many other people made other plans unless they were one of the initial invitees.<br/><br/>So, that's an example of logistics in action. For me, being way too busy at the time to commit to any long-term game, it was perfect, and because the selected GMs would generally spend a lot of time preparing their "best one-shot", the games were very high-quality.<br/><br/>Ryan, how many people were in your IaWA "pool"? I would imagine that unless your numbers were huge, after three or four games everyone would know the mechanics, theoretically speaking, right? I'd like to hear more about the problems you ran into.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177399/#Comment_177399" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-05T10:25:54+00:00" title="November  5, 2008 10:25AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 5, 2008 10:53AM by Ry.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Ryan can you give us an example response to kick us off?</blockquote>I'll use Jonathan's example, as I understand it, and I'm making it more stringent because of my experiences with this kind of setup.<br/><br/>In a Wicked Age, played with a large group of which only some members show up at each session, is like this:<br/><br/># Question? <b>Appropriate Answer.</b><br/><br/>1.

You have to provide the impetus for the gaming within the group.<br/><br/>Some possible modifications or solutions:<br/><br/>1. Figure out who the "core" people are, and, when they're not present, play something else, like a one-shot or a boardgame or whatever floats your boat. Don't be afraid to cancel a session now and then.<br/><br/>2. People wanting to play but then not being able to keep up to the commitment could mean you set the bar too high. Maybe instead of a weekly game, you can set some level that they CAN and WILL commit to? Like, "Hey, I want to play this game. Let's all schedule three evenings, right now, that we all commit to." After the three sessions, you can decide whether you want to play some more, make it a regular thing, stop there, etc.<br/><br/>Because some people just want to try something, or don't have the time to play every week. In the long-term, regular commitment-type situation, they may be tempted to say "yes" so they don't get left out. I guess my recommendation is to a) lower the commitment level necessary, but b) require that commitment to be hardcore. This might mean people are only up for one-shots without scheduling in advance. But then you're not building expectations that no one can meet and feeling disappointed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177435/#Comment_177435" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-05T13:10:43+00:00" title="November  5, 2008  1:10PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know what?

The first two times, enough people showed up, but for the third time, no one confirmed their presence at all, so I cancelled. <br/><br/>Could it be that, three weeks in a row, it started to look like a regular thing, and so they figured they could always skip and do it the following week?<br/><br/>Does regularity (i.e. constant supply) actually decrease the odds that people will show up on any given night?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177437/#Comment_177437" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-05T13:17:00+00:00" title="November  5, 2008  1:17PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 5, 2008 1:24PM by Simon_C.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an interesting question.  I think a lot of it comes down to the people.  I'm the kind of person that if I say I'm gonna be somewhere, I move heaven and earth to make sure I really will be there.  I'm also highly motivated by roleplaying - I'll turn up to roleplaying things consistently, because I'm pretty devoted to my hobby.  Possibly also I just don't have a very busy life.<br/><br/>I guess in groups there is always going to be a range of enthusiasm levels, from "always, every time, no matter what" to "maybe, if I feel like it, if nothing better comes along".<br/><br/>I think Ryan's got the right idea, looking for games that work at a significantly lower level of buy-in.  I've long said that one of the big turn-offs to the hobby is the percieved high level of commitment required.  No one would play soccer if you had to join a professional team in order to play.  The fact that you can just have a kick-about with your friends now and then is what makes the game popular - it supports a range of commitment levels.  <br/><br/>Now, as for specific games that support low buy-in play, I think that one-shots and pick-up games are a good place to start, but possibly the problem starts with the "prepare situation, learn rules, make characters, play for hours" model of gaming.  Can we imagine a game that worked a bit like a soccer kick-about, where players can drop in and out, play at any level of ability and with any number of people, and don't have to show up more than once?  That seems like it would be a pretty radical design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177440/#Comment_177440" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-05T13:51:43+00:00" title="November  5, 2008  1:51PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            when ever i advertise my willingness to run a game for my friends , I require an RSVP<br/><br/>If you plan on showing up you both A&gt; Gotta tell me and B&gt; Gotta do it in writting (we use email so not an issue, but a few people have used sticky notes in the past.                             <br/><br/>This isn't so much a game issue, as a logistics issue.

I almost wrote about that but left off certain techniques from the list so I don't sounds evil :-( What I usually do is contact certain people directly before I send out a mass request. Who I contact directly often depends on who I think will have the most drawing power. Either someone people like or want to roleplay with or whatever. I secure this person first and then use them to draw others. Sometimes you can daisy chain this. One person draws a group and out of that group you target someone who draws a different group. Giving you a wider selection and growing interest. All this stuff strangely works. It's hard work but once you have a routine it gets easier. But some techniques are like magic tricks.

Always aim for 5 players so that last minute no-shows don't reduce #'s below a "critical mass" but "all present manageable".<br/><br/>5 - No, playing time is more 2.5 to 3 hours (travel times and busy schedules have diminished it from height of 4 hours+ for several years).  Always a weeknight and never Monday or Friday, and put pressure on keeping things starting on time.<br/><br/>6 - No, increasingly others have little time to do stuff away from table, have discussed this (e.g., less input via internet postings about backstory) and moved what was expected there to "at table".  Awkward timing, as I enter a phase of being less comfortable with DM fiat and it being "DM's story" volume of information from Players has been dropping off.<br/><br/>7 - No, DM alone does work away from table, with (large) exception of two others paying for and doing tech work to support a private discussion forum online for posting schedules, adventures, rules downloads etc.<br/><br/>I used to post highlights on our private forums but as player input based on those tapered off, have grown briefer in what I post and switched to "in game" documents (reports on their activities filed by their superiors).<br/><br/>I do use the forums to make clear after the fact rationales behind rules-rulings, be clear "what the situation is", trying to make sure that we can "move directly to action" at table (e.g., playing 4e, exactly where they are on their big skill challenge that is playing out over a month long military mission and reminding of house rules on action points for rerolls).  <br/><br/>This includes generic "public news", e.g., kicked off campaign with them getting their orders for mission.  The general military situation etc. was posted on forum a week earlier so rather than lecture on that, it was straight, "Here's your orders, any questions - right get your kits from Quartermaster and move out in the morning".<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178218/#Comment_178218" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-11T14:37:11+00:00" title="November 11, 2008  2:37PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan,<br/>\n  I have a regular Thursday night group with 8 people (ugh, too many some times)<br/>\n     1. Do the members of the group currently have generally compatible schedules?<br/>\nMostly, right now we all have Thursday nights off. I don't think we could play another day if we had to.<br/>\n   2. Do these schedules allow most of the members to meet regularly in person?<br/>\nYes, we rarely miss more than one person a week, and most times no people miss.<br/>\n   3. Can you expect the schedules to be stable or adapt flexibly while maintaining a regular meeting time?<br/>\nSeems pretty stable.<br/>\n   4. Does the group have access to a comfortable, semi-private venue, such as a player's home?<br/>\nYeah, my place. Its not too central, but everyone knows it and likes it well enough.<br/>\n   5. Can the group regularly accommodate gaming sessions of 4 hours or more?<br/>\nClose, we usually get about 3 hours in. But we play every week, so its not too bad.<br/>\n   6. Do all members of the group have the time and inclination to do game-supporting activities away from the table before the first session?<br/>\nNo, not really, sometimes  I will get character gen and stuff like that out of the way on 2-3 players, but it is not too reliable to be honest.<br/>\n   7. Do all or most members of the group have the time and inclination to do game-supporting activities away from the table on a regular basis?<br/>\nNo, this would be an issue if we really required it, but I can't think of any game-supporting activities that I would want/need them to do on their own<br/>\n   8. Does the group have a supply of props, miniatures, tokens, office supplies, and so on, or do they have the funds and inclination to purchase such objects?<br/>\nI have a decent supply and most of the more hard core gamers bring their own as well.<br/>\n   9. Does the venue include a large table to play at?<br/>\nYeah, one of those 6 foot tables they use for bake sales at schools and what not<br/>\n  10. Does the group have the resources for all members to buy a copy of one or two hardcover game books, and do some members have the money to buy several more books?<br/>\nNo, this is an issue, most of them are too much of casual gamers to buy the book. Usually we end up with two copies between the 8 of us.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Other stuff along the lines of what John wrote:<br/>\nI do SMS/e-mail/call people on the day of the game (a little reminder doesn't hurt)<br/>\nWe do figure out food before everyone arrives (lately we have been eating before we show, but there has been pizza/chinese delivery in the past)<br/>\nWe do allow time for socializing. for at least half of the group, this is the only time they see each other normally<br/>\nWe do try and keep it on the same day every week (switching days makes for people forgetting and making other plans)<br/>\nWe do try and play every week (trying to twice a month or whatever has failed miserably for me in the past)<br/>\nWe do try to be nice to each other, so there is no hardcore rules like "no table talk" or anyhting that getsin the way of having a good casual game.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Its been pretty fun, I wish these guys would learn the rules better and/or work together better, but we are all having fun, so I don't bother to brow beat them, lol<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178249/#Comment_178249" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-11T22:38:54+00:00" title="November 11, 2008 10:38PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My regular group.

Every question in your list is wholly valid - but becomes even moreso by addition of a supplemental question "+(a) No fuckers, do you REALLY mean that answer YES?"<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to be part of a big gaming community but very few of them actually gamed. They talked about gaming, they bought the books, they discussed why a particular game wasn't right for them but when the chips came down they rarely ever played. If they did manage to get their arses to the table, the game inevitably lasted one session as it wasn't the orgasmic gaming experience that they had dreamt it would be. In the end I just laid down a line and said 'Only people that want to play bother coming!' Four did. And we still game together, every other weekend, eight years later.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you have to accept that whilst some of your answers (the table, props and books) might not change, the time and commitment ones will vary across time. Flexibility is the key and commitment. If one of us is going to miss a session we let the GM know well in advance. The session may move to a more appropriate date. The session may be bumped a week. The story may change so that the character is elsewhere. We have developed a tolerance and an ability to roll with these things. However, overriding all of this is the idea that Gaming Comes First. An idea that you will not see your gaming as an insta-bump activity for soccer practice, gardening, going to the movies or painting the hallway. For five hours, every other week, you game.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur other thing is nigh constant communication - we have a messageboard and three active blogs which we all use. Many of us speak on IM or once a week at the pub. We are all friends. We are very open about our thoughts on the games and helping each other improve (and giving props when things go amazingly). So we know when someone has a paper due, or a conference to speak at or a work project looming. We are aware of birthdays and holidays and anniversaries and conventions and we build them into our calendar.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall though, my experience is that you will only get committed gaming from committed gamers. For people who see it as just another possibility on any given night for something to do, you will get minimal gaming.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
