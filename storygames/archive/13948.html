Work with me here, please, and lets try to attack the <i>theme</i> with a new twist ... (and leave any personal soreness out of it)<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hexabolic</cite>I shed a few tears at a Werewolf game, of all things.  Some powerful drama worked out between a dying elder of the sept and the truculent warder.  Excellent stuff, not at all what I expected from that game.</blockquote>The sad thing about Werewolf and Vampire, is that these games have a theme that may blow your brains out, but instead the games work to dull most of their players.<br/><br/>I know there are thousands of players out there, who have made their World of Darkness a vivid thing. Those of them reading this will have to forgive me for being so unfair when ignoring their ability to make these games right. Forgive my unfair (and partly unfounded) generalization, please. Let it ride, for the sake of discussion. <br/><br/>I am sad for the many storytellers and player-groups who have failed to make these games into the jewels they should be, and sad for my own experience with them. I came to these games as an adult and experienced player, but with great expectations all the same, and found nothing but odd leadership and strangely placid players. So these games failed to deliver me, and had made my more WoD-experienced co-players into something I barely recognized as interactive participants in a game.<br/><br/>- From the way these games present themselves, I would expect playing them to bring you, the player, to the brink of tears. I would expect them to engage most players profoundly, and to produce meaningful drama of high quality. <br/><br/>- From the way these games are played, however, I do not expect them to bring me anywhere. I can see how players fall for the cool content, and how many of them fail to see that the coolness of it is hollow, as the method leaves the storyteller impotent, and fails to place the players in the eye of the storm.<br/><br/>I love these legends still, and would like to have a discussion on how to make the legends right in role-playing games. I've already done this in a thread on the vampire. Now I would like to do the same on the werewolf. So here's my agenda for this thread:<br/><br/><b>- How do you design for interesting werewolf-play?</b> <br/>- How do you support the players in the conflicts of the werewolf? <br/>- Do you have an example of this done right (game or session), and thoughts on why?<br/><br/><b>- How do you make <i>potent</i> player-character werewolves?</b> <br/>- What kind of character is the werewolf, actually?<br/>- How do you work with the tension between human and wolf in it?<br/><br/><i>I'm talking "potent" as in; playable, captivating, emotionally challenging and thought-provoking ...</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark" title="Captain_Thark"><img alt="Captain_Thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/674/nQDB5F77NZR8N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">Captain_Thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315967/#Comment_315967" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-09T00:26:46+00:00" title="March  9, 2011 12:26AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part of me has been thinking in Forsaken, what could really make the game sing is a focus on Protecting What is Yours and What Values You Hold, so as a GM you constantly are threatening things the players are invested in while their characters make hard choices about what they'll give up to try and get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, if you replaced territory with family legacy, I think it would work well in Apocalypse too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_315970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315970/#Comment_315970" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-09T01:39:50+00:00" title="March  9, 2011  1:39AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I believe you are on to something, Noah.<br/><br/>So; what kind of things would you propose to use as the focal points?<br/><br/><b>Protecting What is Yours</b><br/>- Family<br/>- Sweetheart<br/>- Friend(s)<br/>- Childhood home<br/>- A wolf-pack<br/>- ?<br/><br/><b>What Values You Hold</b><br/>- Love (connecting to family, friends, sweetheart)<br/>- Faith (connecting to religion and/or human compassion)<br/>- Hope (seeing a life for yourself or your loved ones, or searching for a cure)<br/><br/>What other values/virtues could be interesting to work with?<br/><br/><b>How would you propose to connect them, and make them important to the player?</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315983/#Comment_315983" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-09T05:41:22+00:00" title="March  9, 2011  5:41AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I always felt that there were two interesting things about the WOD games.

With VtM, there were actually probably groups aside from the clans that should have been treated as playsets.<br/><br/>The oWoD was inds funny too in that within the sort of groupingthat would make a good playset, you really kinda wanted variations on a theme with a couple of weirdoes thrown in, while big multiple criss-crosses seem to mean that you wanted more stereotypical members. <br/><br/>Maybe it would even have been easier if part of character creation simply first answered: What is the commonality between all of these characters?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316016/#Comment_316016" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-09T10:06:47+00:00" title="March  9, 2011 10:06AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>From the way these games present themselves, I would expect playing them to bring you, the player, to the brink of tears.</blockquote>\n(Maine auto mechanic voice again) "Well <i>there's</i> your problem..."<br/><br/>Dang Maine auto mechanics!<br/><br/>Anyway, onwards.<br/><br/>The original WoD Werewolf conception of them as big avengers of the natural world to me didn't really ring true, but it did provide a commonality (and that "pack" experience) that people in later posts are looking for.  Werewolves in oWoD had a mission - without them, the world would be obliterated.  The nWoD version was less catastrophic and more creepy, as werewolves were the natural protectors/regulators of an entire spirit ecology. Both of these established a common baseline for a group of werewolves.  (More about the tribe/splat thing in a bit.)<br/><br/>However, I always saw lycanthropy as a de-evolving curse, something that exalts our animal nature to the point where it becomes literal, and the destructive impulse of our animal nature becomes magnified to a horrific proportion.  The werewolf, to me, is what anyone could become. Dr. Jekyll was a good guy, for the most part, but even a good person has a bad side.  <br/><br/>While I like this a lot, it's really not suited to small-group play.  After all, when I'm wrecking everything important to me, why the hell should they care? Also, in most werewolf stories, the werewolf doesn't know they're a werewolf. They lack control over their situation in those moments.  This means roleplaying (in the "I play my character" sense) ends at those points.  The consequences the character suffers as a result of their werewolfery is absolutely out of their control.<br/><br/>So I can see why the traditional view of werewolves didn't really spark much in the way of gaming.  It's something that victimizes people, not something that empowers them.  We have to look elsewhere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316030/#Comment_316030" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-09T11:16:42+00:00" title="March  9, 2011 11:16AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>While I like this a lot, it's really not suited to small-group play.

At the conclusion of the story, the players figure out who among them is the werewolf - the last one to not have encountered the werewolf and suffer consequences.  This might actually work well with something like Dread wherein people are slowly eliminated/vindicated until only one remains (and that person has to narrate the guilt-ridden postlude in which they realize that they were the werewolf all along).  There should probably be a strong mandate to scatter the party when the werewolf attacks and have each person narrate what they are doing in the short time that they are separated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316034/#Comment_316034" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-09T11:24:11+00:00" title="March  9, 2011 11:24AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like this, actually it might make a good Annalise hack.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_316043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316043/#Comment_316043" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-09T12:06:34+00:00" title="March  9, 2011 12:06PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good observations, Marshall, and a very interesting proposal!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark" title="Captain_Thark"><img alt="Captain_Thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/674/nQDB5F77NZR8N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">Captain_Thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316049/#Comment_316049" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-09T12:42:38+00:00" title="March  9, 2011 12:42PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: TomasHVM<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat other values/virtues could be interesting to work with?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow would you propose to connect them, and make them important to the player?<br/>\n<br/>\nPosted By: TomasHVMo<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll need to check my copy of teritories again, but I really loved the idea of player spending points to define their territory. In my experience, players always care the most about protecting their cool ideas. I seem to remember some stuff was weird in territories, though, like having to spend your already overtaxed merit points to use them. I think hacking that part would be easy, though. The more complicated part would be the values. I sort of saw them like beliefs from Burning Wheel: Explicit statements about the Werewolf's world view.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of values you mentioned Tomas were good starts, but I'd even expand it to things like "I must protect nature at all costs!". That could actually take on some interesting nuances in a Forsaken game with the way the predatory spirit world works.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is also assuming a game that isn't really concerned with horror all that much, since I actually do like the way Werewolves are presented in either WoD to be pretty cool, especially the Uratha from Forsaken.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316082/#Comment_316082" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-09T17:41:13+00:00" title="March  9, 2011  5:41PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Werewolves of Millers Hollow.

The setting is quite rich, and already set up with widely different cultures regarding lycanthropy:<br/>- Some areas got no culture on it, so the cub is left to itself, often hunted as a dangerous beast (and most often turning into a blood-thirsty killer of own kin).<br/>- Some areas got a strong culture on lycanthropy, having werewolves taking care of new cubs, helping them trough the difficult first stages, and giving them an established group to relate to (and to mediate their position in society).<br/>- and there's the odd cultures that treats it with respect, but little knowledge.<br/><br/>I have given hogs lycanthropy too, so there are wild <i>werehogs</i> to contend with (and to play within the same framework).<br/><br/>Within these frames I have worked, or wish to work, with different set-ups:<br/>- single cub in dire straits, on itself<br/>- single or group of cubs in training, with guidance<br/>- single strong beast, unregulated, raging, ridden with psychosocial challenges<br/>- single strong beast, regulated, one foot in player-group of humans and one in pack<br/>- the pack, player group of werewolves                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_316362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316362/#Comment_316362" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-12T02:40:29+00:00" title="March 12, 2011  2:40AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>- How do you design for interesting werewolf-play?</b><br/>I believe this is done by acknowledging how the werewolf ties into us as humans; what does it symbolize? What can we express trough the werewolf-myth?<br/><br/>I believe the werewolf symbolizes our deepest animal soul; the instincts of our inner beast; a pure being.<br/><br/>One thing we can express trough the myth of the werewolf, is how our instincts may stand in opposition to our highly regulated social relations; the way we <i>civilize</i> ourselves. Humans are social beings, but we also have it in us to be destructively selfish. So the werewolf may symbolize the struggle between selfishness and community-spirit. <br/><br/>Another thing we may express through the werewolf, is the instinctive nature of our sexual desires. The werewolf may be interpreted as a pure sexual being; directly connected to its instincts, and able to follow up on them. This may be expressed through the direct and intimate nature of bonding within the pack (if such one exist in the game), and/or it may be expressed by investing the werewolf with strong sexual appetite and attraction.<br/><br/>The third thing we may express through the werewolf, is the caged beast breaking free, and roaming the world as a being of pure rage. "Rage" as in a being where nothing holds back on its strengths; any action is immediate and totally effective. This may be expressed through the exhilaration of the the hunt. This "pure rage" may be understood as a total lack of restrictive neurosis. As such the playing of a werewolf may have a very benign effect on the nervous player, if he is made able to immerse himself in the experience.<br/><br/><b>- How do a designer support the players in the conflicts of the werewolf?</b><br/>First in this is how we make <i>the player</i> bring the werewolf-symbolism into play. We need to entice and direct the player in his exploration of the werewolf-character, while letting the player keep his powers of interpretation of said character. <br/><br/>This is a general dilemma in all design of role-playing games, but it intensifies when we are dealing with creatures of strange nature; the characters outside our direct experience as human beings. <br/><br/>The werewolf being so strange to us, and still somewhat tied into our humanity, is the main reason I find the werewolf an interesting design-challenge.<br/><br/>There is more to this, but I will bide my pen. Please give me your thoughts on this, and lets see where that brings us ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_316452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316452/#Comment_316452" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-13T07:50:27+00:00" title="March 13, 2011  7:50AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 13, 2011 7:51AM by TomasHVM.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>- How do a designer support the players in the conflicts of the werewolf?</b><br/>First in this is how we make <i>the player</i> bring the werewolf-symbolism into play. We need to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">entice</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">advice</span> the player in his exploration of the werewolf-character, while letting the player keep his powers of interpretation of said character. <br/><br/>This is a general dilemma in all design of role-playing games, but it intensifies when we are dealing with creatures of strange nature; the characters outside our direct experience as human beings. Such characters are not bound by social norms and laws of nature, and as such they need to be defined by the designer.<br/><br/><b>- How much shall we define the strange character of the werewolf?</b><br/>I believe it depends heavily on the method of play. But we need to give some useful hints on physical abilities, mental faculties, and social interaction. Covering those three areas, within the method of choice, a designer should be close to doing a good job in supporting the player.<br/><br/><b>Example definition:</b><br/><br/><i>The full-grown werewolf is stronger than a well-trained knight, and got a punch that throws most people up to three man-lengths. It is slower than a horse, but got staying power to run longer.<br/><br/>It got a highly developed hunt- and pack-intellingence. An experienced hunter is wise leave be the tracks of a werewolf. A master hunter will meet his match in this beast, and may find himself the prey. That is especially true for a werewolf acting as leader of a wolf-pack.<br/><br/>The werewolf is not strictly wolf, but human too, and it prefers to mate with humans. Most werewolves will seek out humans for this reason only. It is craving and brutal in he act, so mating a werewolf is not without danger for a human.</i><br/><br/><b>Example of advice given to the player, in playing a werewolf of the above definition:</b><br/><br/><i>Your character is beset by beastly powers. There is no turning back from this, however much your character tries, and whatever help he gets. Once his inner wolf is awakened, he is doomed to live with this side of himself, and to have it awakened at least once a month (each full moon will have him change into wolf-form, and hunt for the whole night ...). <br/><br/>Aside of this you, <i>the player</i>, decide how often the wolf awakens. Your <i>character</i> don't get to decide. It may happen when your character is angry, when he is aroused, or in other circumstances you deem interesting/logical/cool. And you decide how long it stays that way. So mostly you are free to decide, and to describe your own shape-changing moments. You may also decide if your werewolf is of the kind that fights to subdue, or to kill, or both. This is entirely up to you, but make a choice, and stay with it.<br/><br/>Encountering humans of opposite sex, you must establish if they are worthy of giving you cubs (great strength is good), and if they are fertile (their smell will tell their health). If they are, you must mate with them. Courtship may consist of play-figthing, licking their genitals, and howling! Clothes are best ripped off, not to be of hindrance. And then you do a fast and hard fuck! If they are too weak, you may opt to kill them (not having weak mouths in you pack). If they are barren, they may be tolerated, but only if they hunt well. Weak hunters may be driven off or killed.<br/><br/>You may decide to be a homosexual werewolf. Homosexuality do exist in nature, and so a werewolf may be one too. If you are, you will be driven to mate with both humans and wolves of you own sex. The act is direct and brutal, and it may not leave much pleasure with your partners ...</i><br/><br/>Any comments are appreciated!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
